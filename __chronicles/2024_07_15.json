Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nKP Sharma Oli was sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister after claiming support from 166 lawmakers, following Pushpa Kamal Dahal's failure to secure trust in the House.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City deploys heavy equipment to clear roads to the landfill site during monsoon season to prevent garbage buildup.\nIn a dramatic political shift, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a new government, ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as prime minister and raising concerns about the suppression of progressive agendas enshrined in the constitution.\nIn the 1970s, families from Nepal's hills migrated to Chitwan for fertile land, but recent decades have seen a shift to cash crops and urban expansion, leading to a decline in paddy cultivation and a rise in imports.\nNewly appointed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday formed a 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers.Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers.Prakash Man Singh of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML’s Bishnu Prasad Paudel have been inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Finance Ministry, respectively.Likewise, Congress Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak has been appointed as the Home Minister while Arzu Rana has been given the portfolio of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Deepak Khadka (Energy Ministry), Ajay Chaurasiya (Law Ministry), Aain Bahadur Shahi (Forest Ministry) and Teju Lal Chaudhary (Ministry of Youth and Sports) are other Congress leaders who have been inducted into the Oli Cabinet.Pradeep Poudel, Badri Pandey, and Ramnath Adhikari from the Shekhar Koirala faction of the Congress will assume office as ministers for health, tourism and agriculture, respectively.From the UML, Deputy General Secretary Prithvi Subba Gurung has been appointed as the Minister for Communications. Rajkumar Gupta will head the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration while Manbir Rai has been appointed as the defence minister.Balram Adhikari and Damodar Bhandari will continue in their positions as the Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation and the Minister for Industry Commerce and Supplies, respectively.UML’s Bidhya Bhattarai has been given the portfolio of the Education Ministry and Devendra Dahal the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure.Similarly, Sharad Singh Bhandari of the Loktantrik Samajabadi Party has been appointed as the Minister for Labour.Janata Samajabadi Party leaders Nawal Kishor Sah and Pradeep Yadav will also head the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens and the Ministry for Drinking Water. \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation has increased petrol and diesel prices with effect from Monday midnight. The state-owned monopoly hiked the petrol price by Rs4 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs3 per litre each.Consumers now have to pay Rs171 per litre for petrol in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.They have to pay Rs170 for a litre of petrol in Surkhet and Dang and Rs168.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj.Likewise, a litre of diesel and kerosene will now cost Rs160 in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal; Rs159 in Surkhet and Dang; and Rs157.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nA writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister was filed at the Supreme Court on Monday.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain, and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition at the apex court, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment, arguing that the appointment is unconstitutional.The petitioners have argued that the President should call for the formation of a new government under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.Govinda Prasad Ghimire, information officer at the Supreme Court, said a preliminary hearing on the petition has been scheduled for July 21.President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked a claim with the support of 166 lawmakers. The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed as per the same article, failed the floor test.Oli, along with his 21 Cabinet ministers, took an oath of office and secrecy on Monday.This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive.First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021. \nThe government has decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based TU cricket ground.A first meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Singha Durbar on Monday decided to construct essential infrastructures within ten months.According to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who has been assigned as the government’s spokesperson, this includes seating arrangements for spectators, installing floodlights for night games, and other necessary facilities.The meeting also assigned Lila Devi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary. Gadtaula was officiating chief secretary since June 24 after the government transferred suspended chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal, who has been chargesheeted in a corruption case, to the National Planning Commission. The meeting also decided to provide relief to the families of those missing in the disaster for up to ten days, equivalent to the support provided to the families of the deceased. Minister Gurung said the government has decided to prioritise the search for the missing and the treatment of the injured.The government also decided to make Nepal free of street children within one year. The meeting also decided to release the second and third instalments of relief to the earthquake victims in Jajarkot.Spokesperson Gurung said the Cabinet has decided to disclose its decisions to the public only after 24 hours, except in cases of urgency. \nAs CPN-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli becomes the country’s prime minister for the fourth time, he also carries a chequered history from his previous terms as the country’s chief executive.When he first took the seat at Singha Durbar in October 2015, wresting it from Sushil Koirala, violent protests were rife in the Tarai/Madhesh region in the wake of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal. The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nThis year’s monsoon arrived on June 11, three days earlier than the usual onset date, bringing rain to the eastern parts of Nepal. However, it didn’t move to the rest of the country, which was reeling under a heat wave with temperatures reaching as high as 44 degrees Celsius for weeks. Most initial rainfall predictions failed, and the monsoon that reached the central parts two weeks later was heavy and destructive. In the early hours of June 26, a mudslide in Lamjung district damaged three houses and killed four people—a 67-year-old man, his daughter-in-law and her two young daughters. By July 6, the monsoon was active throughout the country, causing widespread damage to roads and settlements. Landslides reported in 157 places disrupted vehicular movement on most hill roads. The death toll due to landslides alone reached 53, with 19 others killed by floods. On July 12, debris flow on the Muglin-Narayangarh road pushed two buses into the Trishuli River; of the total 65 passengers in the two buses, three were found alive, five found dead and the rest are missing. These early events illustrate the erratic and unreliable nature of monsoons, as has been expected due to a warmer climate. They are also a cause for concern as these emerging trends have affected our economy and livelihoods and led to increased disaster events. Most of these disasters, like the one in Lamjung, could have been prevented with aptly developed stormwater management strategies that our disaster preparedness initiatives have consistently ignored. The changes The monsoon is gradually changing its intensity, rainfall patterns and timing. On July 8, around 624 mm of rain was measured over a single day in Dodhara of Kanchanpur district. It replaced the 1993 record of 540 mm in 24 hours recorded in Kulekhani. The rainfall events are often localised and dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rain. Even then, when one area gets heavy rain, the adjoining area may remain dry. Such an anomaly is more pronounced in mountainous terrain due to its orographic effects. The conventional rainfall forecast does not capture such variance nor does the data from existing meteorological stations provide adequate and real-time information for analysis and planning. The rainfall pattern has also changed. In a country-wide survey conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2022, about 90 percent of respondents across all geographical regions observed changes in the rainfall pattern between June and September—a similar percent of respondents also saw differences in the rainfall pattern during winter. The monsoon is also shifting northward, bringing rain in areas at higher altitudes like Manang and Mustang districts, which normally get either snow or remain dry during the monsoon. Similar studies conducted in Pakistan to assess such a shift indicated that the monsoons there have also moved northward. The study also stated another worrying concern: This shift has made the southern areas, which previously received normal rain, drier as they get less rain now. A similar trend was also observed in India, where some areas in the Gangetic plains have received less rain. However, areas that were arid in the past, particularly in the western part of the country, have started to receive more rain, causing aberrant floods. Required strategyLocal water sources are crucial for most economic activities, particularly farming and sustaining rivulets and khola. The general understanding of the importance of local water issues has grown in the last decade: How haphazard road construction has increased landslides in the hills, how sealing of surfaces in the plains and drainage congestions have led to a growing scourge of urban flooding or how encroachment in the river banks has compounded flood damage. However, the corrective action required remains very slow compared to the changing pace of rainfall patterns. Instead of considering these budding nuances, our approach to both development in general and infrastructure in particular has consistently ignored them—a cost we are bound to bear in the years ahead. The drainage structures rebuilt to accommodate runoff on the major roads in the capital in the last five years have been proven inadequate to drain rainwater during heavy rains. The conventional agriculture rhythm no longer matches this changing context. The shift is inconveniencing those who have adapted their farming and other economic activities to the usual timing and levels of rain/snow. The rice saplings prepared for plantation in the second half of June, for example, matured and became less productive when the rains arrived late for transplantation. Those who planted the right-age saplings on time by pumping water also lost crops when the rain came late due to a dry spell in between. To avoid this threat to our food security and farmers’ economic prospects, it’s time we matched the agricultural rhythm to the changing monsoonal pattern.Engaging the youth Changes in the monsoon are likely to be more pronounced in the years ahead. Unless we enhance our capacity to manage water at the local level, we’re bound to suffer. Hydrological analysis in this altered context requires substantial decentralised data because rainfall’s localised nature often becomes runoff and fails to enter the subsurface to replenish soil moisture and aquifers. In this regard, an example of a community-driven initiative started by the state government of Kerala, India, is worth considering. To generate rainfall data that was as decentralised as possible, they have installed well-equipped weather stations in over 270 government schools in the state and trained students to record changes in rain and temperature to help them understand rainfall anomalies and adopt necessary measures for water management. Kerala’s community-driven initiative to engage, train and empower the decision-makers of tomorrow is an excellent way of ensuring a deeper appreciation of changing rainfall patterns across geographical zones and helping build appropriate strategies to meet local needs. Assisting schools in installing weather stations to monitor rainfall and recognising local water issues will provide future decision-makers with an encompassing awareness of the evolving nature of monsoons and formulate strategies, including affordable and actionable tactics to manage water at the local level. Youth engagement can be further reinforced by introducing practical classes as part of the curriculum on building water harvesting structures, such as small ponds, and monitoring their progress periodically while they’re in school. This will help them gain invaluable knowledge about rainfall, local hydrology and understanding how managing rainwater is, in fact, crucial to sustaining our lives and our environment in a warmer world.  \nNepali politics is full of absurdities. If governmental stability is boring and nauseating, instability is a pastime for politicians. The more we observe Nepali politics, the more it looks like a pantomime or what we call nautanki. All such manoeuvrings and manipulations, aided and abetted by high-sounding rhetoric of stability and progress, are, in fact, leading the country nowhere. Politics is becoming uglier each day, resulting in stagnation and uncertainty. Moreover, the political parties’ leaders do not hesitate to call such grotesque doings democratic exercises. The latest event is the sudden change of alliances between the CPN (UML) and the Maoist Centre. Now, KP Sharma Oli has joined hands with the Nepali Congress’s (NC) Deuba to exchange the post of prime minister at intervals. The 10-year Maoist insurgency in Nepal ultimately landed in a hostile environment the Maoist Party had always denounced as inappropriate for the country. For the Maoists, the violent revolution à la Maoist variant was the apotheosis of transformation and progress. In its wake, the 2005-06 revolution paid rich dividends to the Maoist leaders by catapulting them into the high stage of Nepali politics, making them the first party in the first Constituent Assembly elections held in 2008 and enabling them to head the government. However, its first stint in government was short-lived when it miscalculated and overstretched its strength. The haste with which it tried to grab power by entering the domain of the Nepal Army turned out to be counterproductive. Here, the president’s constitutional role was extended to refusing the recommendation of the prime minister to fire the chief of the army staff, resulting in the ouster of the prime minister in less than 10 months. Any politician who forgets the surface of political reality is destined to fall, and it happened to comrade Pushpa Kamal Dahal, whose long schooling in Maoist ideology and practices of war didn’t work in the most inhospitable context of Nepali politics and society.Moreover, Leninism and Maoism espoused by the communist parties—Leninism for the CPN (UML) and Maoism for the Maoist Centre—are neither tenable nor practicable, as the revolution launched by the latter landed in a compromise with its own ‘class enemies’ and ‘reactionaries’. It was indeed a U-turn for Dahal and his colleagues. The CPN (UML) metamorphosed when it suddenly changed its chrysalis into a multiparty system in 1990. Originating from the Jhapa violent movement that adopted Marxist-Leninist Maoist ideology, it eventually joined the restoration of the multiparty movement launched under the stewardship of the NC and subsequently became a systemic party. Now, all the parties subscribe to the multiparty system, albeit with various banners and rhetoric. Still, in substance, they are co-sharers of power and privileges with the much-denounced NC. Originating and evolving as the first liberal party, the NC has the credentials of being a believer in liberal democracy, notwithstanding the deficiencies of this ideology. Now, the NC, like others, is also in the quagmire of dirty politics, indulging in making and breaking alliances forged as a result of the fractured electoral mandate handed down to them. Yet, despite heavy odds encountered by the parties in the past, all of them (including the NC) have a tendency to disfigure the beautiful edifice of republican order. Although their perseverance and dedication to presenting a constitution prepared by the CA was/is commendable, the manner in which they are bent on destroying the spirit of the republic is equally despicable. All their activities are carried out in the name of stability and progress, under the subterfuge of regression and backlash. The democracy we have adopted did not develop by fits and starts as it did in Britain and the Netherlands. These two countries have been able to sustain democracy without giving rise to occasional upheavals that upset democratic stability. Unlike them, France’s top-down approach didn’t allow democracy to strike roots or provide stability. Thus, Britain remains an exception to many other aspirants to democracy. What went wrong with Nepal’s democratic experience? The answers are many and wide-ranging. First, the ideological moorings and orientations of political parties are spurious. Since many come from opposite ideological orientations and actions, it has taken a long time for them to internalise political culture. Even the NC, the so-called grand old party of liberal democracy, has derailed the system by making unholy alliances to remain in power. Although no party can become a purist in today’s political churnings, the NC could have become a role model in laying the foundation of democracy. But its leaders are as self-seeking as others. In the post-1990 multiparty era and under the present Republican dispensation, the NC has failed to show its distinct identity, rather indulging in self-aggrandisement and misgovernance. Changes of governments under any pretext and parroting the rhetoric of democratic credibility would not suffice in the uncanny political context. The second is the crisis of leadership. Most parties’ leaders have been tested by people who perceive them as lacking vision, commitment and determination to advance the agendas of progress. The same leaders who have forfeited public trust are lured by the posts and power. They have allowed the system to rot by indulging in pastime politics, rendering the people silent spectators. Leaders are generally neither transformatory nor honest while discharging their duties in government and opposition. Since leadership is a crucial variable in the early phase of political evolution and change in all dimensions, Nepali leaders even fail to be transactional. They take pride in becoming prime ministers many times without leaving behind the imprints of their governance. Third, the absurdity is begotten by the failures to put institutions on track, as many institutions created by the constitution or others outside it are spoiled by excessive politicisation in the respective parties’ lines. So, institutions are virtually lifeless and hardly generate the popular faith in leadership with which the system needs to revolve. Finally, experiences over the years have shown that opportunistic politics do not allow coalition governments to last for a fixed term because Nepali parties are not made for coalition politics. \nAccording to recent statistics from the World Bank (2023), the unemployment rate among the youth labour force (ages 15-24) in Nepal is 21 percent, a slight increase from 20 percent in 2017. This rate is higher than the regional average. Additionally, older statistics from the International Labour Organisation indicate that approximately 26.1 percent of university graduates in Nepal are unemployed. Most of these graduates are employed in routine jobs. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), many of these positions are at risk of being replaced by AI and automation. As it is often said, \"AI won’t replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” Despite this precarious situation, Nepal is home to an aspirational youth population eager to establish themselves in the growing domestic and foreign economies. These youths need employable skills relevant to today's digital and AI-driven world to climb the economic ladder.As global digitalisation and the adoption of AI and data science transform various sectors, the demand for new skill sets is increasing both nationally and internationally. Organisations are becoming more AI-driven, rendering many traditional job roles obsolete. Consequently, students worldwide must acquire AI skills to remain competitive in the future job market. This trend is particularly relevant for Nepal's Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), where there is a significant data science and AI skills gap. Data science combines mathematics, statistics, specialised programming, advanced analytics, AI and machine learning to uncover actionable insights hidden within organisational data. Based on our interactions with students and corporate entities in Nepal, this piece examines the pressing need to integrate data science and AI into Nepal’s HEIs curriculum. Given the low employability rate among university graduates in Nepal, it is imperative to equip them with these essential skills. Best practicesAddressing these issues requires significant interventions at both policy and strategic levels. India's example reveals a massive impetus from government and private stakeholders on AI skilling over the past several years. Numerous skilling programmes on data science are available in India, ranging from secondary schooling to doctoral levels. Under government initiatives like Skill India, large-scale programmes have been completed and are ongoing to reskill and upskill the workforce in these areas. For instance, many Indian states have introduced Python programming as a compulsory or elective course in secondary school curricula to expose young minds to AI and data skills. Likewise, AI-related courses are going to be added to China’s education system, including primary and secondary schools.What needs to be doneA similar curriculum intervention is necessary in Nepal to cultivate young Nepali minds with data and programming skills for future AI roles. Currently, only a few top-notch business schools in Nepal have incorporated Python coding into their curriculum. However, this practice is not widespread. For undergraduate and graduate curricula across all professional HEI courses in Nepal, introducing data science skills in applied statistics, R programming, Python programming, SQL, data visualisation (using tools like Tableau), machine learning, and deep learning is essential. Additionally, each data science course should include at least one compulsory industry guest lecture (physical or online) from AI or data science experts, whether from Nepal or globally. This will ensure that students know the latest AI trends relevant to the industry.Furthermore, there should be more industry-academia collaborative projects wherein industries can offer real-time data science challenges to students through physical and virtual hackathons. From the perspective of skilling HEI educators, upskilling and Faculty Development Programmes (FDP) should be organised to familiarise them with the latest data science and AI tools. Such programmes should be incentivised to motivate educators to engage actively and learn from these opportunities. Educators skilled in these programmes should be encouraged to work on research projects connecting AI to their field of expertise, with the aim of filing patents or copyrights or publishing them in reputable journals. As the world transitions from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 and soon to Industry 5.0, Nepal must also move its industrial and economic sectors in the same direction using AI and data science.Implementing these interventions would gradually build a culture of AI, data science, and innovation among Nepal's student community, addressing the existing skill gap. Moreover, such initiatives would foster the growth of AI-powered startups in Nepal, providing solutions for various socio-economic and business challenges. Nepal's recent launch of a concept paper on the application and practice of AI is a welcome move. However, it is crucial to formulate how AI can be integrated into the curriculum to ensure that future graduates possess the necessary skills.In conclusion, by incorporating data science and AI into HEIs, Nepal can better prepare its students for the uncertain future job market and foster innovation and economic growth. \nDonald Trump was in Milwaukee on Monday to make final preparations for the Republican presidential nomination later this week after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt that he said presented an opportunity to bring the country together.Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at the former Republican president from a rooftop.One shot hit Trump’s upper right ear, leaving his face streaked with blood, but he was not severely wounded.“That reality is just setting in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”One person in the crowd was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect.On Sunday, both Trump and President Joe Biden counseled calm and unity in a country whose a deep political divide has grown more pronounced during the presidential race.“There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions,” he said. “We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.”“The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” Biden said in a televised address from the Oval Office.World leaders condemned the attack, opens new tab, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” and French President Emanuel Macron calling the assassination attempt “a tragedy for our democracies”.Trump pumped his fist in the air several times on Sunday appearing to mouth the words “Fight! Fight! Fight!”, as he descended the stairs from his plane after arriving in Milwaukee, where he will accept his party’s formal nomination at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” Trump told the Washington Examiner.“I want to try to unite our country,” the New York Post reported Trump saying during the same interview, conducted during the flight to Milwaukee. “But I don’t know if that’s possible. People are very divided.”Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who was shot dead by agents moments after opening fire, could have taken up an elevated position so close to Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the US Secret Service.Biden and Trump spoke to each other on Saturday night after the shooting.The two are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.Suspect a nursing home aideThe FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination.FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone.The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect’s social media accounts.Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated $15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting, he was employed as a dietary aide at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which said Crooks’ background check was clean.The gun - an AR-style-5.56 caliber rifle - had been legally bought, said FBI officials, who believed it had been purchased by the suspect’s father.The officials said “a suspicious device” was found in the suspect’s vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security.The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said.Spectator killed protecting familyThe rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Two people wounded in the shooting were in a stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. \nA car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu on Sunday night, killing five and injuring 20 as patrons were watching the final of the Euro 2024 football tournament on TV, police said, blaming Islamist insurgents.The bomb destroyed 10 cars and damaged several buildings nearby in a well-guarded area near the Presidential Palace, a Reuters reporter said.Al Shabaab militants claimed responsibility for the attack on an affiliated radio station, saying the bombing targeted a place where security and government workers meet at night.The Islamist group, which once ruled much of Somalia, has been fighting for years to impose its strict interpretation of Islam on Somalia.The insurgents have frequently launched raids and deadly attacks in Mogadishu and other regions controlled by the federal government in the last two years, despite losing large swathes of territory to government forces and their allies. \nVarious countries, including India, the USA, the UK, and Pakistan on Monday congratulated Minister KP Sharma Oli on his appointment.They said they are looking forward to working together to strengthen ties between the two countries.Taking to X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is looking forward to working closely to further strengthen the deep bonds of friendship.“Congratulations on your appointment as the prime minister of Nepal. Look forward to working closely to further strengthen the deep bonds of friendship between our two countries and to further expand our mutually beneficial cooperation for the progress and prosperity of our peoples,” Modi said in a post.Likewise, the US Ambassador to Nepal Dean R. Thompson also congratulated the prime minister.“We look forward to working with the new government of Nepal to further strengthen our 77-year partnership, said Thompson in a post on X.Similarly, the British Embassy in Kathmandu congratulated and extended best wishes to the prime minister.“We look forward to further strengthening our longstanding UK-Nepal relationship in the coming days,” it said in a post on X.Likewise, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Oli on taking oath as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time.“I wish him every success and look forward to working with him to further strengthen bilateral ties & promote regional cooperation between our two nations,” said Sharif.President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday appointed CPN-UML Chairman Oli as the prime minister of Nepal. He, along with his 21 Cabinet ministers, took an oath of office and secrecy on Monday.This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive.First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021. \nDefending champions Argentina won a record 16th Copa America title by beating Colombia 1-0 thanks to an extra-time goal from substitute Lautaro Martinez at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida on Sunday.The game, which was delayed by more than an hour after thousands of fans without tickets tried to enter the stadium, was a cagey affair over 90 minutes but opened up in the extra period.Martinez, the tournament’s leading scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112nd minute to spark wild celebrations among Argentina fans.Argentina’s latest title comes on the back of their triumphs at the 2022 World Cup and 2021 Copa America, and gives eight-times Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi the perfect sendoff in what is likely his last international tournament.Colombia started the match by pressing high up the pitch and Jhon Cordoba hit the post in the seventh minute before Jefferson Lerma and Richard Rios had long-range efforts saved by Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi appeared to hurt his ankle in the 36th minute after a collision with Santiago Arias and while he got back to his feet after receiving treatment he was clearly hampered for the remainder of the half.Colombia went on the offensive again in the second half with Arias and Davinson Sanchez coming close to scoring.Argentina soaked up the pressure well but were dealt a blow in the 66th minute when Messi limped off due to the ankle injury.They continued to grew into the contest and had a goal disallowed for offside but Colombia held on as the match went to extra time.The defending champions continued to push forward in extra time, testing Vargas with a shot from Nico Gonzalez before Martinez finally found the breakthrough.Argentina’s win also ended a record 28-match unbeaten streak for Colombia, whose last defeat also came against ‘La Albiceleste’ in February 2022. \nRescuers have recovered the bodies of 11 people during the search for the passengers missing since Friday’s accident. However, the identities of four of them are yet to be ascertained.Authorities had found two bodies, stuck at the Gandak barrage in Triveni Dham late on Sunday. Two of the sluice gates were closed to retrieve the bodies on Monday, said Mahesh Rayamajhi, head of the Triveni police office.According to the Chitwan district police office, the victims have been identified as a 22-year-old man from ward 22 of the Bharatpur Metropolitan City and a 17-year-old boy from Jamunamai of Rautahat district.They were travelling on the Kathmandu-bound Angel Deluxe bus and Ganapati Deluxe bus, en route to Gaur from the Capital, respectively.Sixty-two people went missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Mugling road section at around 3:30am on Friday.According to Chitwan Chief District Officer Indradev Yadav, 27 passengers’ names were recorded at the ticket counter of the bus travelling to Gaur from Kathmandu. Yadav said it had been confirmed that 11 more people were travelling on the bus, according to their relatives.A total of 23 passengers were on the bus en route to Kathmandu from Birgunj, as per the record maintained at the ticket counter. Four more people were on board the bus as per their relatives, said Yadav.Three of the passengers on the Ganapati Deluxe bus had managed to escape after jumping out of the vehicle. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy today. Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of the country.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.The maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nWritten by philosophy enthusiast Bishnu Sapkota, ‘Adiyeka Paila’ is a novel that explains the complicated dynamics of feelings in human relationships. Astitwa and Anasuya are the protagonists of the novel. Another character of the story, Bandana, stands to be the deuteragonist. And no, the book is not about the love triangle. Instead, it is about a candid narration of each character's feelings, which ultimately shape their life. Astitwa is introduced as a university teacher of Kirtipur. He teaches English literature to university students. Anasuya is an MBBS student. Astitwa and Anasuya meet through Anusaya’s father, Mani, a professor at Kirtipur University. To assist Astitwa with completing his thesis, Astitwa’s friend Pramod advises him to coordinate with Mani. Their first interaction is similar to the novel ‘Lolita’ setting. Astitwa, in his 20s, is seven years older than Anusuya, who is still a minor.Anasuya instantly falls for Astitwa upon seeing him in her house. Additionally, as an MBBS student passionate about literature, it's easy to see why Anasuya would develop an infatuation with someone knowledgeable, single, and a literature lover like herself.The pair starts going on dates, and their conversation often concerns philosophically defining love. Astitwa’s take on love combines all the principles he has absorbed as a university student. Contrary to this, Anasuya is introverted in expressing herself yet bolder and wiser when approaching matters of love. She postulates that love has little to do with rationality and reasoning. However, Astitwa states, “Love was made to ease the complexities of navigating societal norms and emotional landscapes. Therefore, there is no guarantee that tomorrow love will not wither.” The author has effectively assessed the maturity levels between boys and girls in love. His analysis addresses the widely debated and often clichéd notion that girls generally show more maturity than boys.The journey of their attraction blooming into love is characterised by beautiful butterfly moments that aren’t discussed in depth in other books I have read. The discourse surrounding such intricate details assures the reader like it has assured me, that it is expected to fixate on the qualities of someone you admire. The following dialogue perfectly captures the essence of one’s obsession. “After all, everyone is made up of the elements of feelings. No matter how many logical arguments we make, our actions are driven by our emotions”. The entire plot of the novel rests on a single premise, much like in movies, where an actor portrays various characters in different films, the roles in the novel shift and change based on the circumstances and contexts the characters face.Similarly, human beings play various roles in their own lives. Our existence is dynamic and multifaceted, enabling us to embody different versions of ourselves as we navigate different phases and experiences.The author’s background as a columnist may have inspired the progression of social issues in the novel. Astitwa’s students, Bandana and Mohan, are victims of the repercussions of the Maoist Conflict in Nepal. Mohan, a member of the Madhesi community, moves to Kathmandu to study for his master's. Once there, he gains a clearer perspective on the silent discrimination his community faces.An article by JB Pun Magar on the topic ‘Manu Smriti, Muluki Ain and the rise of Bahuns’ rightly captures the dilemma that Mohan faces regarding the accusations of the ruling caste where they maintain that indigenous people incite division with ethnicity-based federalism. At the same time, the indigenous people contend that the ruling class perpetuates racism through historical privilege and marginalisation of ethnic communities. Similarly, Bandana, who has lost her father during the Maoist insurgency, confides in Astitwa regarding her struggles with the grief of losing a parent. However, the bond that Anasuya and Astiwa share isn’t love, as the author mentions through his exaggerated explanation of love, feelings, and rationality.Either one has attachment issues, or, in modern language, they are in a “situationship”. The novel is slow running in its pace yet steadfast in developing new arcs in the plot. Before Bandana, Astitwa and Anasuya had already stopped talking to each other. This incident not only takes a toll on Anusuya's mental health but also disrupts her relationship with her parents.The fallout occurs because Astitwa insists that Anasuya reveal their relationship to her parents. Despite her opposition, Anasuya complies with her boyfriend's demands.Her parents are not entirely opposed to this new information, yet it is a task for them, especially the father, to accept that his daughter will grow up to be an adult. As the story unfolds, Astistwa receives a scholarship for his PhD program from Notre Dame University, one of the most prestigious universities in the US. After spending nearly six years in the US, Astitwa returned to Nepal despite the opposition of his colleagues from Kirtipur who had settled abroad.At this particular juncture, the author has painted the picture of the stark realities faced by many Nepali students studying abroad. The novel does not conclude with a typical Cinderella ending, where estranged lovers reconcile. Instead, it features a mature and unconventional ending, allowing readers to uncover the explanation as the story progresses gradually.However, the novel’s characters stand to be romantic and slightly idealised, which makes it difficult for an ordinary reader to fully encapsulate the duality and complexities portrayed by the author. In hindsight, the novel is an excellent portrayal of one’s deepest feelings, which are layered by the principles and conventions built by society around us. Through the characters, the author urges the readers never to eschew the inevitable waves of emotions that shape our deepest selves. Drawing from his experience living abroad, the author implies the importance of culture and native language in authentically expressing one’s emotions.Adiyeka PailaAuthor: Bishnu SapkotaPublisher: Fine PrintYear:2023 \nWithin the rich heritage of Newa art, you might have heard of Paubha or Thanka, two types of cloth painting known for their religious iconography. Many tourists leave Nepal with at least one of the two tucked away in their suitcases, hoping to hang a unique reminder of their travels on their walls. But for foreigners and Nepalis alike, few have heard of Bilampau, an elusive narrative art style that may have been inspired by Paubha. Bilampau in Newa means horizontal painting.Though Paubha is a much more established and recognisable Newa art form, both Paubha and Bilampau are scroll paintings guided by Thyaa-saphu, folded sketchbooks that were kept by Newa families. Thyaa-saphu stipulates necessary thematic and narrative elements for Buddhist stories; Bilampau, for example, often begins with the figure of the narrator themselves, whether it be Lord Buddha—common in Buddhist scroll paintings—or Lord Ganesha, in the case of Hindu stories.But Madan Chitrakar, renowned artist, researcher, and scholar, reveals that the similarities between Paubha and Bilampau largely end there. “The subject matter and motifs are very different,” he says. While Paubha’s religious characteristics support meditation and worship, the importance of storytelling is prominent in Bilampau and its “narrative scroll” composition. Unlike Paubha, Bilampau depicts stories with multiple elements and episodes. This sequence is often established through a collection of frames on one scroll, though some Bilampau artworks utilise a single scroll without frame-by-frame separation. Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, museologist, curator for Nepal Art Council, and curator of the current Itumbaha museum exhibition, emphasises that Bilampau are not meant for veneration. “In ancient times, they didn’t have comic books, right?” she jokes. Instead, visual storytelling was done through creations like Bilampau.On June 18, 2024, Siddhartha Art Gallery opened its doors to the public for its most recent exhibition on Kalighat paintings, Ganjifa playing cards, and Bilampau. Though the gallery certainly focused on the legacy of Kalighat, all three art forms underscore the unique cultural ties between Nepal and India.At the opening, artist Chitrakar also spoke on the significance of Bilampau, calling it one of the most “misunderstood” forms in Nepali art history.What does it mean to truly understand an art form? And when it comes to the expansive depths of art history, what does it mean to remember an art form in its entirety? How can we revive a dying art form back into the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century?The earliest existence of the visual narrative technique in Nepal can be traced back to the 12th century, depicted not through scroll but through wood. Newa artists were also likely commissioned to create Bilampau for specific walls in Buddhist temples, hence its impressive horizontal length. Indeed, Bilampau also holds some surprising diversity in sizes and dimensions, with many ranging from nine feet to a whopping 78 feet in length—a testament to its visual significance.Comparisons can also be drawn between Bilampau and Patachitra, a cloth painting form based in West Bengal, Odisha, and Rajasthan. Both Bilampau and Patachitra were created by Chitrakar artists in India and Nepal, and the two forms also share a reputation for story-telling. However, Bilampau is more commonly horizontal, while Patachitra is typically vertical in its episodic visualisation.It is possible that Bilampau grew into its own art form from the influence of Patachitra, signifying another historical connection between India and Nepal, but so little is known about the evolution of Bilampau that it is difficult to come to a precise conclusion about its origins.Today, most traditional Buddhist Bilampau are kept in local monasteries. According to Chitrakar, one of the most famous Bilampau is currently held in Itum Bahal. Kayastha notes that the Bilampau in Itum Bahal depicts the foundation of the Itum Bahal monastery.During the Newa Gunla festival, which is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, the significance of Bilampau storytelling is also treasured amongst Vihara and Newa Buddhists. “For fifteen days,” Kayastha explains, “all the monasteries will display the objects they have in their storage, which people have donated over time. One of those objects would be the Bilampau.” Kayastha highlights that the Bilampau is not only a source of education regarding the monastery’s history but also a source of community engagement. Members of the community take it upon themselves to safeguard their heritage and cultural objects, usually sleeping in the same room as the Bilampau and other artefacts.At Siddhartha Art Gallery, there are two Bilampau, both depicting Hindu stories; due to the artistic shift towards Hinduism, the older Bilampau, consisting largely of Buddhist stories, is much less accessible.Bilampau is no longer an active form in traditional Nepali art, which means that truly understanding its significance also begets recognising its disappearance from popular Nepali art discourse. Despite being one of the earliest forms of visual story-telling in Nepal, “it is almost forgotten,” remarks Chitrakar.A quick Google search of ‘Bilampau’ results few substantial results except for a single scholarly article written by Chitrakar himself.The fear of this art form growing obsolete extends far beyond art history, just as art history itself holds broader implications on the importance of culture and identity.In Nepal, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that the country’s citizens share a common responsibility to protect traditional Indigenous culture, calling it the “identity and prestige” of Nepal as a whole.Traditional festivals and art forms are certainly still celebrated and recognised, whether it be on the streets of Kathmandu or within one of the city’s museums or galleries, but several artisans and scholars have shared their growing concerns about the future of traditional Nepali art.Many artists from the older generation, for example, fear that the younger generation will no longer continue the artistic practices—such as Paubha painting—that their families have inherited for generations.We must take it upon ourselves to raise awareness and actively engage with the artists and cultural significance that accompanies these forms—otherwise, our collective apathy might result in these traditions reaching the same untimely fate as Bilampau.Though Bilampau died out a century ago, one method of reviving its presence might entail a call for collectors to bring their Bilampau pieces forward, increasing public accessibility. For others, simply talking about Bilampau and remembering its place in history might be more than enough.“When we talk about Nepali art traditions,” says Chitrakar, “we must not miss Bilampau,” echoing the value in appreciating a lesser-known art form. And when we remember Bilampau, we must also hold on to the other art forms that are still surviving, carrying legacies that have spanned across entire wars, nations, and generations—and, if all goes well, with many more journeys to come. \nOn July 1, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML reached a deal to form the government with KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairperson, taking the prime ministerial seat first. That would be possible in a coalition formed as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.While the Congress and the UML were confident that Article 76 (2) would be invoked as the President invited the parties to form the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN (Maoist Centre) had been claiming that the government formation process should be shifted to Article 76 (3). Maoist leaders repeatedly claimed in and outside Parliament that as the Dahal government was formed as per Article 76 (2), his successor should be appointed under Article 76 (3).Article 76 (3) coming into play meant Oli would not become the prime minister this time, as the constitutional provision pertains to a minority government led by the largest party. Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, would become the prime minister. On July 3, the UML recalled its ministers while also withdrawing its support to the Dahal government. The prime minister was then left with two options: resign or face the House.Despite knowing that he would lose the confidence motion, Dahal opted for the vote. That was because he believed the President would initiate a new government formation process under Article 76 (3) after he lost the trust vote.Article 76 (3) says in cases where the prime minister of a coalition government fails to win the confidence of Parliament, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House as prime minister. “Our party believed that Article 76 (3) would be invoked after the prime minister lost the vote of trust. This is why he [Dahal] chose the vote of confidence instead of resigning,” an office bearer of the Maoist Centre told the Post. However, President Ramchandra Paudel, hours after Dahal lost the floor test on Friday evening, called two or more parties to stake a claim to the government as per Article 76 (2). Paudel had consulted some constitutional experts before making the call. All the experts except one had suggested that he go for a coalition government—rather than a minority one—citing the Supreme Court’s rulings. They were of the opinion that there is no constitutional barrier to calling for government formation under Article 76(2) as Dahal’s floor test was his fifth since taking office in December 2022 in the House elected that year.Article 76 (3) is automatically invoked when the prime minister appointed under Article 76 (2) fails the floor test in the first attempt. The last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support.The Maoist Centre is not happy with the President's decision. \"Yes, the President's call is not what we wanted. We believe it was a political move rather than legal,\" Hit Raj Pandey, the party's chief whip, told the Post. Asked if his party will challenge the move in court, Pandey said \"no\".However, the party’s office bearers said the Maoist Centre will not confront the President directly. Lawyers close to the party are most likely to file a writ petition in the court.\"There is every possibility that our legal wing will challenge the President’s move in the Supreme Court,\" he told the Post. Lawyers close to the party reiterate that Article 76 (3) is the only option for government formation after the prime minister loses the vote of confidence.Former attorney general Mukti Pradhan is one of those advocates close to the Maoist Centre who make such a claim. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel will appoint KP Sharma Oli, CPN-UML chairman, as prime minister on Sunday after the Nepali Congress and UML submitted claims supported by 165 lawmakers, the minimum needed to form a government.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a vote of confidence, prompting the formation of a new government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML, supported by the Nepali Congress, amidst accusations of conspiracies and criticism of the proposed constitutional amendments that threatened inclusive representation.\nDespite initial successes, Prime Minister Dahal's fifth vote of confidence attempt faces defeat as the largest coalition partner, UML, and several other parties withdrew support, leaving him with only 63 likely votes in a parliament where 138 are needed for a majority.\nKathmandu intensifies mosquito larvae destruction drive to curb dengue spread amid monsoon.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City's mental health screening training for doctors and paramedics aims to provide timely treatment for the numerous patients with mental health issues in the city, with plans to also offer free medication and address the stigma associated with these conditions.\nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nThe British Education Group, which owns The British College, Kathmandu, has now acquired the Maritime Business College (MBC), one of the oldest private institutes in Nova Scotia, Canada.Founded in 1899, MBC has a rich history of providing advanced career training. Over 125 years, the Halifax-based institution has built a strong reputation for educational excellence and adaptability in the evolving job market. The British Education Group said in a press statement that the local Ministry of Education also fully accredited the college as a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), making it one of the few private colleges in Canada authorised to recruit international students.They currently offer a diverse range of programmes, including Business Administration, Veterinary Assistance, Medical Device Reprocessing, Interior Decorating, and 2D-3D Animation and Digital Arts. As a result of this new partnership, the British Education Group plans to introduce additional courses offered at its London campus, Woolwich College. Rajen Kandel, Group CEO of the British Education Group, said, “We are committed to providing our students with global opportunities and experiences. This acquisition will facilitate seamless credit transfers between our Nepal, Dubai, and Canada campuses, further promoting our vision of creating global citizens.” The group owns several educational institutions in Nepal, Dubai, and London.  \nNepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nSpain’s Mikel Oyarzabal scored four minutes from time as they capped a dominant Euro 2024 campaign with a deserved 2-1 win over England in Sunday’s showpiece for a record fourth title and condemned their opponents to a second straight final defeat.Oyarzabal finished off a swift counter-attack for the winner after England had fought back from a goal down for the fourth successive match and seemingly earned extra-time.“I have done my job,” said Oyarzabal, who came on for captain Alvaro Morata after 67 minutes. “Just the fact of being in the 26, you value it a lot. It happened to me but could have happened to anyone.”Spain manager Luis de la Fuente added: “I couldn’t be happier. A real team, European champions. I said I was proud and today I am even prouder. It confirms what we are. For me, they are the best in the world.”After a cautious first half where Spain had 65% possession but England’s Phil Foden managed the only shot on target, the Spaniards struck two minutes after the restart, despite losing influential midfielder Rodri to injury at the break.Teenager Lamine Yamal, who had been shackled completely in the first half, finally found space down the right and crossed for Nico Williams to slot home past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Spain then enjoyed a purple patch with a series of sharp attacks as England’s previously watertight defence lost its shape and Dani Olmo, Morata and Williams all had good chances.England manager Gareth Southgate sent on Ollie Watkins, the scoring substitute hero of the semi-final, for an ineffective Harry Kane after an hour, with Cole Palmer, England’s most creative player in the last month, joining him 10 minutes later.PAY OFFThe changes paid off almost immediately when Jude Bellingham laid the ball back into Palmer’s path and the substitute curled home a precise low 20-metre shot in the 73rd minute.The massed ranks of England fans, who vastly outnumbered their rivals, exploded and the whole feel of the night changed.But Spain weathered the storm and a lapse of concentration saw England undone as Marc Cucurella was left in space on the left, received the ball from Oyarzabal and drilled it across the box for the substitute to stretch out a toe and poke it home.There was still time for more drama as Spain keeper Unai Simon parried a Declan Rice header from a corner and Dani Olmo then brilliantly headed away Marc Guehi’s follow up on the line.It meant that Spain added a fourth title to those won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and, as only the third team in the last nine Euros to win the trophy without coming through a shootout at some point in the tournament following France (2000) and Greece (2004), nobody can deny they were worthy winners.For England the “30 years of hurt” after their 1966 World Cup success, which was the soundtrack to their hosting of Euro 96, will now run to at least double that number as they became the first team to lose successive Euro finals“We’ve competed until the very end of the final,” said Southgate, who is widely expected to step down having remarkably led his country to two Euro finals and World Cup semi and quarter-finals in his eight years in charge.“I think we didn’t keep possession of the ball quite well enough. They press you really well and you've got to get out of that pressure and we weren’t able to do that and in the end that meant they had more control of the game“The players have got to take enormous credit for getting us to the point they did. They way they fought and represented the shirt with pride. They were never beaten until the very end, the final five minutes of the last game and then that chance at the end. Just the character and resilience that they’ve shown.“It’s fine margins, but I think they (Spain) were the best team in the tournament and they deserved to win.” \nUruguay beat Canada on penalties in the Copa America third-place playoff match on Saturday after Luis Suarez scored a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.Rodrigo Bentancur also scored in regulation time for Uruguay, while Jonathan David and Ismael Kone scored for Canada, who finished fourth in their Copa America debut.Canada’s Ismael Kone had a tame spot-kick saved by goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and Canadian defender Alphonso Davies hit the crossbar as Uruguay won the shootout 4-3.Suarez and Bentancur also converted their penalty kicks in the shootout.“It was a hard blow, the previous match, but we knew we had to be mentally prepared because it was not the same to finish third than fourth,” Rochet told DSports.“We made a great effort against Canada but the wear and tear was noticeable. We tied it with a great goal by Suarez and we finished it off in penalties.”In the first half, Bentancur swivelled and smashed home a knock-down from a corner to give Uruguay the lead in the eighth minute, but Kone scored with an acrobatic scissor kick to level the scores 14 minutes later.Right after Canada’s goal, Uruguay had a break and Facundo Pellistri slotted his right-footed shot into the bottom corner, but Maximiliano Araujo was deemed to be offside in the build-up and the goal was disallowed.Canada went ahead in the 80th minute when Kone unleashed a long-range shot that Rochet parried, before Jonathan David pounced to slot home the rebound.Uruguay pressed for an equaliser and Canada goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair made a huge save on Suarez’s close-range left-foot effort seconds before the equaliser.Their pressure paid off when all-time leading goalscorer Suarez timed his run perfectly in the 92nd minute to get on the end of a Jose Maria Gimenez pass and score his 69th international goal to force a penalty shootout.“You can play a good game and end up losing it on penalties. Everyone who stepped up to take a penalty kicked it with confidence and where they thought it would go in,” Canada’s Davies told TSN.“Overall, I'm proud of my team. To come in this competition and compete with very good teams, it's an achievement that will live with us forever.”On Sunday, defending champions Argentina take on Colombia at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, to decide the continental title. \nUS President Joe Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office on Sunday to ask Americans to lower the political temperature and remember they are neighbors after a would-be assassin wounded Republican rival Donald Trump.Trump’s shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday “calls on all of us to take a step back,” Biden said. Thankfully Trump was not seriously injured, he said.“We can’t allow this violence to be normalized. The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” he said. “We all have a responsibility to do this.”“In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box. Now that’s how we do it. At the ballot box. Not with bullets,” Biden said in a speech that was about seven minutes long, and carried live by major news networks and the conservative channel Fox News.It was Biden’s third use of the formal setting of the Oval Office to comment on issues of major importance to Americans since he took power in 2021. This time, it is less than four months to go before the November 5 election, and Biden’s political future is in doubt.Biden’s appearance allowed him to demonstrate the power of incumbency, an important symbolic image as he battles some in his own Democratic Party who want the 81-year-old leader to step aside from seeking re-election out of concerns he lacks the mental acuity for another four-year term.Biden ran through some of the US’s multiple instances of political violence in recent years, including the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by Trump loyalists and the hammer-beating injury of Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in 2022.“Violence has never been the answer,” Biden said.Four US presidents have been assassinated and several escaped assassination attempts. Multiple presidential candidates have been shot, some fatally.White House officials hope the Trump shooting attempt might ease the pressure on Biden to step aside by prompting Democrats to rally around him.Biden garbled a few words and phrases in his address, a regular occurrence for the president, but one in the spotlight after his faltering June 27 debate performance. After he finished the address, Fox News Channel and other conservative news outlets highlighted his stumbles.Biden’s Oval address was a rare one. Last October he made a prime-time speech to comment on the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts and in June of 2023 he spoke when a deal was reached with Republicans to avoid a breach of the US debt ceiling.His campaign has called off verbal attacks on Trump to focus instead on the future. Within hours of Saturday's shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications.“Tonight I’m asking every American to recommit,\" Biden said. “Hate must have no safe harbor.”But he said it is fair to contrast his vision with that of the former president, and that he planned to do so soon. Biden called off a trip to Texas on Monday for a civil rights address but will go to Las Vegas Tuesday for a speech. \nThe FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in the attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally.The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump was speaking on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack. One rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear.State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election in which Trump is challenging President Joe Biden would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race.When Crooks was 17, he made a $15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.In Bethel Park, about an hour away from where the shooting occurred, the streets surrounding the Crooks’s home were blocked off by law enforcement authorities.Mary and Stanley Priselac were standing on the porch of their nearby brick ranch-style home, trying to process the events of the last day and the spotlight now on their typically quiet residential neighborhood.“Nothing happens on the street, everybody kind of minds their own business,” said Stanley Priselac, 72. “Everybody is kind of shocked, surprised, some dismay.”“There’s never been a gun issue. There’s never been the police being called,” said Mary Priselac, 67. “You kind of have to wonder what didn’t he get in life? What led to this extreme?”Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to a statement from the Bethel Park School District received by local ABC affiliate WJET-TV.“Our school district will cooperate fully with the active law enforcement investigation surrounding this case, and as such, we are limited in what we can publicly disclose,” the statement read.The school district did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Reuters.Crooks received a $500 “star award” from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper.A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods.“We’re looking at photographs right now and we’re trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation,” Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing.Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect. \nEngland look to end almost six decades without a major trophy but must overcome the more fancied Spain in the European Championship final in Berlin which woke to sunny skies and an excited atmosphere ahead of kickoff.The Olympiastadion in the German capital hosts the clash at the conclusion of a drama-packed, month-long tournament that saw Spain stride seamlessly into the deciding game while England emerged from several narrow escapes into their first major final on foreign soil.They have not lifted silverware since the 1996 World Cup but feel their topsy-turvy route to Sunday’s final has built the necessary fortitude to see off the Spanish threat.“I think that the belief has grown as we’ve gone through the tournament, with what we’ve been through with the late goals and penalty shootouts … it builds resilience,” captain Harry Kane told reporters on the eve of the game.Both teams arrived in Berlin from their respective bases - England at Blankenhain near Leipzig and Spain at Donaueschingen in the Black Forest - on Saturday afternoon.They have a long day’s wait before kickoff at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), spending it quietly in their respective hotels, broken up with a walk or kickabout and final tactical talk.Final wordsEngland manager Gareth Southgate is not planning a rousing speech. “We’ve got good experience of big matches now and I think at these moments you don’t need to say too much to the players, they don’t need motivating for a game like this - it’s about making sure the small details are right as fine margins decide these games and we’ve got to make sure we’re on the right side of them,” he said.Spain coach Luis de la Fuente has already revealed what he will be telling his players. “I always blush because I ask too much of them – but I’m not asking anything special tomorrow night,” he said when he spoke to the press on Saturday.“They will give it all, I see their faces, their spirit. I will tell them to enjoy something they have earned with hard work, dedication and concentration.”Spain, who have won three previous Euros, might be favourites but they will have to raise their play, the coach said. “We know that if we don’t play above the level we have shown so far, are not completely focused, we won’t be able to win,” De la Fuente added.Berlin was showing its best side in the run up to the game with warm temperatures and blue skies as fans in respective team colours milled around the city. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIndia must seek a broader regional engagement beyond bilateral immediacies in the Middle East. India’s diplomacy in the Middle East is again under pressure from conflicting parties of the Arab-Israeli crisis. India’s traditional policy of favouring a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent and viable Palestinian state remains unchanged. Nevertheless, much has changed about how India reinterprets the meaning and the context of its Palestine policy.After the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Indian media and right-wing public opinion had overwhelmingly supported the Israeli military response in Gaza. New-Delhi-based Arab diplomats expressed their unease over the increasingly hostile public opinion towards Palestine.Beyond the balancing actThe ruling Bhartiya Janta Party’s pro-Israeli gestures are no secret to the Arab diplomats. They knew that a BJP-led government in New Delhi would start a new chapter of relations with Israel beyond the traditional “balancing act.” The BJP and its eco-system of support see Israel as a country that always stood with India in times of crises with Pakistan. Israel, aware of India-Pakistan disputes, fully used this as an opportunity and kept its normalisation efforts with Pakistan secret to avoid India’s sensitive public opinion. Those who are aware of Israel’s efforts to normalise ties with Pakistan understand that two Muslim nations, Pakistan and Indonesia, remain top priority for Israel and its Western backers who facilitated the Abraham Accords.Saudi Arabia, too, supports Pakistan-Israeli relations, as Pakistan remains its key traditional ally. In this context, the India-Israeli ties may not stay exclusive and may not be specifically Pakistan-centric in the long term. Israel, along with Pakistan and Turkey, was a key supporter of Azerbaijan’s recapture of Nagorno Karabakh in 2020, while Armenia relied on Indian military supplies. Since the Gaza-Israel conflict started, India has faced a different challenge.First, there is a strong pro-Israeli public opinion that is ingrained in the ideology of the ruling party and its supporters in India. Second, under Narendra Modi’s decade-long rule, India has decided to end the previous reluctance and isolation from regional affairs, reprioritising its relations with Gulf countries.How China fits inIn an ongoing competition for influence in the Gulf between the United States and China, India has joined the West-led efforts to support the Gulf countries’ security and stability. This is a bid to check the growing Chinese influence in the region. India is ready to offer strategic and security support to the region in the newly upgraded relations. The China-brokered Iran-Saudi normalisation has also helped India.For India, Iran’s real strategic value is not in the Gulf but in Central Asia and South Asia, where Iran supports India’s efforts in multiple connectivity projects. In this sense, India’s advancing relations with Israel have received little or muted objection from Iran. When news broke about India supplying arms and ammunition to Israel amid military conflict, neither Arab states nor Iran reacted. The supply of ammunition, yet to be confirmed officially, is a significant statement on India’s recalibration of Middle East relations.All official statements of India’s Ministry of External Affairs have underlined that Hamas’ actions on October 7, 2023, were acts of “terrorism,” a position taken by most of Western governments and silently supported by their Gulf allies, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. India has previously welcomed the Abraham Accords, a Donald Trump-era initiative to re-engineer the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict outside the UN resolutions. Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Qatar, and Iran have refused to jump on the bandwagon of the so-called new peace process.Crisis shapes the futureThe ammunition supplies to Israel may bring more support for India within Western capitals. However, the Arab-Israeli crisis continues to shape the future balance of power in the Middle East, mainly against the Western countries and their Gulf allies. Saudi Arabia has been more cautious and sensitive to the crisis because its domestic politics is more susceptible to widespread anger and unrest if it is perceived to be supporting Israel at the cost of a Palestinian state. Iran, with its regional ambitions, enjoys popular support in Lebanon, Yemen, and parts of Gulf societies. Whether the Arab states accept Iran’s role in the Arab-Israeli crisis or not, it remains an influential player whose support is crucial to maintaining any peace mechanisms. The brief military confrontation between Iran and Israel has alarmed the European powers about losing their say in the region if the US continues to disregard Palestinian demands.The biggest loserEgypt, on the other hand, is the biggest loser in the crisis despite having supported Israel for decades. Egypt is also wary of alternative routes being created by the India-Middle East Economic Corridor. The Israeli plans to carve out a new canal between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean via the occupied Gaza are not going well with Egypt. That is the reason why Egypt must protect Hamas despite its abhorrence of Hamas’ ideological patron, the Muslim Brotherhood.India is seeking opportunities for defence exports as the Modi government focuses on developing a robust defence industry. However, selling ammunition to Israel during a war showcases arms exports as a political statement. India’s quest for a regional strategy, however, has to be in compatible with the realities of the region where India is situated. Its geopolitics will, therefore, be tested less in the Atlantic and more in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf.Regional actors show little faith in American leadership and are searching for a new security architecture, which is less dependent on the US and Europe and willing to resolve regional crises.In the post-Gaza war period, regional powers like Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia may actively seek the participation of Russia and China in the region. India must, therefore, be ready for a broader regional engagement beyond bilateral immediacies.-360info \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe Nepali Congress and CPN-UML forged an alliance to form a coalition government under KP Sharma Oli, potentially reviewing and amending the constitution to address political stability concerns, following Prime Minister Dahal's perceived instability and external interference.\nOver half of students failed Nepal's Secondary Education Exams due to teacher quality, outdated teaching methods, and inadequate implementation of the new letter grading system.\nNepalese Prime Minister's visit to India emphasized bilateral cooperation, energy trade, and the implementation of trade agreements with China while highlighting the need for improved diplomatic appointments and reciprocity.\nIn 28 districts, the National ID card will be required to access government services, despite criticism that the cards have not been widely distributed.\nCloudy weather and rainfall are expected across the country, with heavy rainfall warnings for Koshi, Gandaki, and Bagmati provinces.\nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Karnali Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Bagmati Province.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nKP Sharma Oli was sworn in as Nepal's Prime Minister after claiming support from 166 lawmakers, following Pushpa Kamal Dahal's failure to secure trust in the House.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City deploys heavy equipment to clear roads to the landfill site during monsoon season to prevent garbage buildup.\nIn a dramatic political shift, the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML formed a new government, ousting Pushpa Kamal Dahal as prime minister and raising concerns about the suppression of progressive agendas enshrined in the constitution.\nIn the 1970s, families from Nepal's hills migrated to Chitwan for fertile land, but recent decades have seen a shift to cash crops and urban expansion, leading to a decline in paddy cultivation and a rise in imports.\nNewly appointed Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli on Monday formed a 22-member Cabinet, including two deputy prime ministers.Shortly after Oli’s swearing-in, President Ramchandra Paudel administered the oath of office and secrecy to the newly appointed ministers.Prakash Man Singh of the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML’s Bishnu Prasad Paudel have been inducted as deputy prime ministers. They will also head the Ministry of Urban Development and the Finance Ministry, respectively.Likewise, Congress Chief Whip Ramesh Lekhak has been appointed as the Home Minister while Arzu Rana has been given the portfolio of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Deepak Khadka (Energy Ministry), Ajay Chaurasiya (Law Ministry), Aain Bahadur Shahi (Forest Ministry) and Teju Lal Chaudhary (Ministry of Youth and Sports) are other Congress leaders who have been inducted into the Oli Cabinet.Pradeep Poudel, Badri Pandey, and Ramnath Adhikari from the Shekhar Koirala faction of the Congress will assume office as ministers for health, tourism and agriculture, respectively.From the UML, Deputy General Secretary Prithvi Subba Gurung has been appointed as the Minister for Communications. Rajkumar Gupta will head the Ministry of Federal Affairs and General Administration while Manbir Rai has been appointed as the defence minister.Balram Adhikari and Damodar Bhandari will continue in their positions as the Minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation and the Minister for Industry Commerce and Supplies, respectively.UML’s Bidhya Bhattarai has been given the portfolio of the Education Ministry and Devendra Dahal the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure.Similarly, Sharad Singh Bhandari of the Loktantrik Samajabadi Party has been appointed as the Minister for Labour.Janata Samajabadi Party leaders Nawal Kishor Sah and Pradeep Yadav will also head the Ministry of Women, Children and Senior Citizens and the Ministry for Drinking Water. \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation has increased petrol and diesel prices with effect from Monday midnight. The state-owned monopoly hiked the petrol price by Rs4 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs3 per litre each.Consumers now have to pay Rs171 per litre for petrol in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.They have to pay Rs170 for a litre of petrol in Surkhet and Dang and Rs168.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj.Likewise, a litre of diesel and kerosene will now cost Rs160 in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal; Rs159 in Surkhet and Dang; and Rs157.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nA writ petition challenging the appointment of CPN-UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli as prime minister was filed at the Supreme Court on Monday.Advocates Deepak Adhikari, Khagendra Prasad Chapagain, and Shailendra Kumar Gupta filed the petition at the apex court, seeking a mandamus order to annul the appointment, arguing that the appointment is unconstitutional.The petitioners have argued that the President should call for the formation of a new government under Article 76(3) if a government formed under Article 76(2) fails to secure a vote of confidence.The Office of the President, the Federal Parliament Secretariat, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister Oli, among others, have been named defendants in the petition.Govinda Prasad Ghimire, information officer at the Supreme Court, said a preliminary hearing on the petition has been scheduled for July 21.President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday appointed Oli as the prime minister after he staked a claim with the support of 166 lawmakers. The President had made a call as per Article 76(2) of the constitution after Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who was appointed as per the same article, failed the floor test.Oli, along with his 21 Cabinet ministers, took an oath of office and secrecy on Monday.This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive.First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021. \nThe government has decided to upgrade the Kirtipur-based TU cricket ground.A first meeting of the Cabinet chaired by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli in Singha Durbar on Monday decided to construct essential infrastructures within ten months.According to the Minister for Communications and Information Technology Prithvi Subba Gurung, who has been assigned as the government’s spokesperson, this includes seating arrangements for spectators, installing floodlights for night games, and other necessary facilities.The meeting also assigned Lila Devi Gadtaula as acting chief secretary. Gadtaula was officiating chief secretary since June 24 after the government transferred suspended chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal, who has been chargesheeted in a corruption case, to the National Planning Commission. The meeting also decided to provide relief to the families of those missing in the disaster for up to ten days, equivalent to the support provided to the families of the deceased. Minister Gurung said the government has decided to prioritise the search for the missing and the treatment of the injured.The government also decided to make Nepal free of street children within one year. The meeting also decided to release the second and third instalments of relief to the earthquake victims in Jajarkot.Spokesperson Gurung said the Cabinet has decided to disclose its decisions to the public only after 24 hours, except in cases of urgency. \nAs CPN-UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli becomes the country’s prime minister for the fourth time, he also carries a chequered history from his previous terms as the country’s chief executive.When he first took the seat at Singha Durbar in October 2015, wresting it from Sushil Koirala, violent protests were rife in the Tarai/Madhesh region in the wake of the promulgation of the Constitution of Nepal. The situation had been more difficult due to India’s blockade. A few months into Oli’s tenure, the southern neighbour withdrew its blockade while the constitution was amended to address the concerns of the agitating communities. Though the Madhesh-based parties boycotted voting on the constitution amendment, it had partially addressed the concerns of the dissenting groups. His government also signed a historic Trade and Transit Agreement with China, ending Nepal’s sole dependence on India for third-country trade.Oli’s nationalist graph as prime minister for 10 months between October 2015 to August 2016 went up so high that his CPN-UML not only emerged the largest party from the 2017 election but was very close to the majority mark on its own. When Oli moved into Baluwatar for the second time in February 2018, he had an even stronger electoral mandate. After a merger with the CPN (Maoist Centre) two months later, the Nepal Communist Party that he jointly led with Pushpa Kamal Dahal enjoyed a near two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives. Oli’s prime ministership started with high hopes and excitement as he was leading a majority government for the first time in around two decades. As Oli was set to lead the government for a full five-year term, the hope was that decades of political instability would end, the constitution would be implemented and the federal system strengthened. The expectations, however, were short-lived. Oli started demonstrating his authoritarian streak right after taking charge as the executive head. He brought the National Intelligence Department, the Department of Revenue Investigation and the Department of Money Laundering under the purview of the Prime Minister’s Office.His intolerance for dissent became apparent when he banned protests at Maitighar, near Singha Durbar, the government’s seat. His government then prepared a slew of bills aiming to muzzle the media, curtail freedom of expression and shrink civic space. He had contested the elections by selling big dreams—railway connecting China, Nepal’s own ship in the high seas, and distribution of gas through pipelines, among other things. But none of these dreams even came close to fruition. Having realised he had failed to deliver as promised even two years after coming to power, he played another nationalist card—amending the constitution to show Kalapani, Lipulekh and Limpiyadhura in Nepal’s map—which his predecessors never dared to do. While it has been registered as a historic move in the country, it antagonised New Delhi.Oli’s unilateral style of running government and leading the party forced Pushpa Kamal Dahal and Madhav Kumar Nepal to ally against him, leading to a split in the Nepal Communist Party. After failing to keep the NCP united, Oli tried to dissolve the House—twice in under six months.His decision to trample on the constitution to stay in led to his humiliating exit from the government. He was ousted by the Supreme Court. Political analysts say Oli has a historic opportunity to right the previous wrongs. “The Congress-UML alliance has generated high hopes and provides an opportunity for Oli to correct his past mistakes,” Uddhab Pyakurel, who teaches political sociology at Kathmandu University, told the Post. “However, Oli’s recent statements [on House dissolution] show he is still not in the mood for course correction. He has no regrets about his wrongdoings.”Oli has repeatedly defended his move to dissolve the House even until last month. The Congress-UML alliance stands on the foundation for stability. But how can the person who couldn’t give stability even when he commanded a majority government ensure stable government now, says Pyakurel. “Trust in the new government will be low as the parties have kept secret even the agreement that led to its formation,” he says.However, some analysts say it would not be easy for the incumbent not to deliver. “There is a strong voice within both the Congress and the UML that it is futile to form a government that cannot deliver. So the pressure to perform will come from both the ruling alliance as well as the opposition,” says Sanjeev Humagain, who teaches PhD students in politics and international relations at Tribhuvan University.“The Congress-UML coalition has the political capital needed to deliver. The bureaucracy too will find it difficult not to cooperate with the government of two major forces. I see a positive environment for delivery.” \nKP Sharma Oli begins his fourth term as prime minister with a bit of baggage. Most infamously, during his third term, when the time came to hand over his prime ministership to his coalition partner as earlier agreed, Oli chose to dissolve the House of Representatives—twice—rather than voluntarily give up power. Thankfully, the Supreme Court stepped in to avert an untimely election. Rightly or not, Oli has over the years built a reputation for wheeling and dealing and for surrounding himself with yes-men. He is not someone comfortable reaching across the aisle. In fact, his stubborn and acerbic nature has made it easy for others, including his coalition partners during previous terms, to take offence. At 72 and in iffy health, Oli is also seen as someone whose time in Nepali politics has come and gone. On the external front, too, challenges galore. In recent times, ‘China’s man in Nepal’, as dubbed by the Indian media, has had a difficult relationship with New Delhi. Of course, he must be lauded for taking a dogged stand against the 2015-16 Indian blockade. But then Oli started spouting all kinds of nonsense like claiming that Lord Ram was born in Thori of Nepal rather than Ayodhya of India, unnecessarily needling the powerful BJP establishment. These are big hurdles no doubt. But they are not insurmountable. During the latest negotiations with Congress leaders, for instance, he is reported to have assured them that he has ‘matured’ and will refrain from taking juvenile steps like dissolving the House on a whim. He is also someone strongly wedded to the idea of a two-party polity, a strategy that suits many in the Congress just fine. (Whether it suits the country is a different thing.) As the agreement between the two big parties in the lead up to the formation of the new government is yet to be made public, it is hard to make definite predictions. Yet if Oli can channel his strong character to use the over two-thirds majority in the House for productive purposes, he can get a lot done. On India too, Oli was for long known as someone with personal rapport with top Indian leaders—and he still has the confidence and capacity to take personal initiative to mend fences. Disliked in Delhi and mistrusted in Beijing, Oli nonetheless will have his task cut out maintaining an increasingly difficult balance between the two neighbours.The priority for the new Oli government, just like it was for its predecessors, will be to breathe some life into a stagnant economy. A message of political stability given through a two-thirds majority will help. Yet both in and outside the country, there is a justified suspicion over the longevity of this ‘unnatural’ Congress-Communist coalition. Oli as prime minister must be ready to make some tough personal adjustments in order to stop the cycle of instability in government. This means not just reining in his natural tendency to rebuff critics and rely on a small coterie on all vital matters but reaching out to coalition partners and even the opposition parties as often as he can. In fact, if Oli tries to go it alone, before long this coalition too will implode. Whether while trying to revise the constitution, making important appointments, or crafting a budget, his government must be seen to be striving to engage the widest section of relevant stakeholders. The onus is on Oli to prove his critics wrong.  \nThis year’s monsoon arrived on June 11, three days earlier than the usual onset date, bringing rain to the eastern parts of Nepal. However, it didn’t move to the rest of the country, which was reeling under a heat wave with temperatures reaching as high as 44 degrees Celsius for weeks. Most initial rainfall predictions failed, and the monsoon that reached the central parts two weeks later was heavy and destructive. In the early hours of June 26, a mudslide in Lamjung district damaged three houses and killed four people—a 67-year-old man, his daughter-in-law and her two young daughters. By July 6, the monsoon was active throughout the country, causing widespread damage to roads and settlements. Landslides reported in 157 places disrupted vehicular movement on most hill roads. The death toll due to landslides alone reached 53, with 19 others killed by floods. On July 12, debris flow on the Muglin-Narayangarh road pushed two buses into the Trishuli River; of the total 65 passengers in the two buses, three were found alive, five found dead and the rest are missing. These early events illustrate the erratic and unreliable nature of monsoons, as has been expected due to a warmer climate. They are also a cause for concern as these emerging trends have affected our economy and livelihoods and led to increased disaster events. Most of these disasters, like the one in Lamjung, could have been prevented with aptly developed stormwater management strategies that our disaster preparedness initiatives have consistently ignored. The changes The monsoon is gradually changing its intensity, rainfall patterns and timing. On July 8, around 624 mm of rain was measured over a single day in Dodhara of Kanchanpur district. It replaced the 1993 record of 540 mm in 24 hours recorded in Kulekhani. The rainfall events are often localised and dominated by high-intensity, short-duration rain. Even then, when one area gets heavy rain, the adjoining area may remain dry. Such an anomaly is more pronounced in mountainous terrain due to its orographic effects. The conventional rainfall forecast does not capture such variance nor does the data from existing meteorological stations provide adequate and real-time information for analysis and planning. The rainfall pattern has also changed. In a country-wide survey conducted by the National Statistics Office in 2022, about 90 percent of respondents across all geographical regions observed changes in the rainfall pattern between June and September—a similar percent of respondents also saw differences in the rainfall pattern during winter. The monsoon is also shifting northward, bringing rain in areas at higher altitudes like Manang and Mustang districts, which normally get either snow or remain dry during the monsoon. Similar studies conducted in Pakistan to assess such a shift indicated that the monsoons there have also moved northward. The study also stated another worrying concern: This shift has made the southern areas, which previously received normal rain, drier as they get less rain now. A similar trend was also observed in India, where some areas in the Gangetic plains have received less rain. However, areas that were arid in the past, particularly in the western part of the country, have started to receive more rain, causing aberrant floods. Required strategyLocal water sources are crucial for most economic activities, particularly farming and sustaining rivulets and khola. The general understanding of the importance of local water issues has grown in the last decade: How haphazard road construction has increased landslides in the hills, how sealing of surfaces in the plains and drainage congestions have led to a growing scourge of urban flooding or how encroachment in the river banks has compounded flood damage. However, the corrective action required remains very slow compared to the changing pace of rainfall patterns. Instead of considering these budding nuances, our approach to both development in general and infrastructure in particular has consistently ignored them—a cost we are bound to bear in the years ahead. The drainage structures rebuilt to accommodate runoff on the major roads in the capital in the last five years have been proven inadequate to drain rainwater during heavy rains. The conventional agriculture rhythm no longer matches this changing context. The shift is inconveniencing those who have adapted their farming and other economic activities to the usual timing and levels of rain/snow. The rice saplings prepared for plantation in the second half of June, for example, matured and became less productive when the rains arrived late for transplantation. Those who planted the right-age saplings on time by pumping water also lost crops when the rain came late due to a dry spell in between. To avoid this threat to our food security and farmers’ economic prospects, it’s time we matched the agricultural rhythm to the changing monsoonal pattern.Engaging the youth Changes in the monsoon are likely to be more pronounced in the years ahead. Unless we enhance our capacity to manage water at the local level, we’re bound to suffer. Hydrological analysis in this altered context requires substantial decentralised data because rainfall’s localised nature often becomes runoff and fails to enter the subsurface to replenish soil moisture and aquifers. In this regard, an example of a community-driven initiative started by the state government of Kerala, India, is worth considering. To generate rainfall data that was as decentralised as possible, they have installed well-equipped weather stations in over 270 government schools in the state and trained students to record changes in rain and temperature to help them understand rainfall anomalies and adopt necessary measures for water management. Kerala’s community-driven initiative to engage, train and empower the decision-makers of tomorrow is an excellent way of ensuring a deeper appreciation of changing rainfall patterns across geographical zones and helping build appropriate strategies to meet local needs. Assisting schools in installing weather stations to monitor rainfall and recognising local water issues will provide future decision-makers with an encompassing awareness of the evolving nature of monsoons and formulate strategies, including affordable and actionable tactics to manage water at the local level. Youth engagement can be further reinforced by introducing practical classes as part of the curriculum on building water harvesting structures, such as small ponds, and monitoring their progress periodically while they’re in school. This will help them gain invaluable knowledge about rainfall, local hydrology and understanding how managing rainwater is, in fact, crucial to sustaining our lives and our environment in a warmer world.  \nNepali politics is full of absurdities. If governmental stability is boring and nauseating, instability is a pastime for politicians. The more we observe Nepali politics, the more it looks like a pantomime or what we call nautanki. All such manoeuvrings and manipulations, aided and abetted by high-sounding rhetoric of stability and progress, are, in fact, leading the country nowhere. Politics is becoming uglier each day, resulting in stagnation and uncertainty. Moreover, the political parties’ leaders do not hesitate to call such grotesque doings democratic exercises. The latest event is the sudden change of alliances between the CPN (UML) and the Maoist Centre. Now, KP Sharma Oli has joined hands with the Nepali Congress’s (NC) Deuba to exchange the post of prime minister at intervals. The 10-year Maoist insurgency in Nepal ultimately landed in a hostile environment the Maoist Party had always denounced as inappropriate for the country. For the Maoists, the violent revolution à la Maoist variant was the apotheosis of transformation and progress. In its wake, the 2005-06 revolution paid rich dividends to the Maoist leaders by catapulting them into the high stage of Nepali politics, making them the first party in the first Constituent Assembly elections held in 2008 and enabling them to head the government. However, its first stint in government was short-lived when it miscalculated and overstretched its strength. The haste with which it tried to grab power by entering the domain of the Nepal Army turned out to be counterproductive. Here, the president’s constitutional role was extended to refusing the recommendation of the prime minister to fire the chief of the army staff, resulting in the ouster of the prime minister in less than 10 months. Any politician who forgets the surface of political reality is destined to fall, and it happened to comrade Pushpa Kamal Dahal, whose long schooling in Maoist ideology and practices of war didn’t work in the most inhospitable context of Nepali politics and society.Moreover, Leninism and Maoism espoused by the communist parties—Leninism for the CPN (UML) and Maoism for the Maoist Centre—are neither tenable nor practicable, as the revolution launched by the latter landed in a compromise with its own ‘class enemies’ and ‘reactionaries’. It was indeed a U-turn for Dahal and his colleagues. The CPN (UML) metamorphosed when it suddenly changed its chrysalis into a multiparty system in 1990. Originating from the Jhapa violent movement that adopted Marxist-Leninist Maoist ideology, it eventually joined the restoration of the multiparty movement launched under the stewardship of the NC and subsequently became a systemic party. Now, all the parties subscribe to the multiparty system, albeit with various banners and rhetoric. Still, in substance, they are co-sharers of power and privileges with the much-denounced NC. Originating and evolving as the first liberal party, the NC has the credentials of being a believer in liberal democracy, notwithstanding the deficiencies of this ideology. Now, the NC, like others, is also in the quagmire of dirty politics, indulging in making and breaking alliances forged as a result of the fractured electoral mandate handed down to them. Yet, despite heavy odds encountered by the parties in the past, all of them (including the NC) have a tendency to disfigure the beautiful edifice of republican order. Although their perseverance and dedication to presenting a constitution prepared by the CA was/is commendable, the manner in which they are bent on destroying the spirit of the republic is equally despicable. All their activities are carried out in the name of stability and progress, under the subterfuge of regression and backlash. The democracy we have adopted did not develop by fits and starts as it did in Britain and the Netherlands. These two countries have been able to sustain democracy without giving rise to occasional upheavals that upset democratic stability. Unlike them, France’s top-down approach didn’t allow democracy to strike roots or provide stability. Thus, Britain remains an exception to many other aspirants to democracy. What went wrong with Nepal’s democratic experience? The answers are many and wide-ranging. First, the ideological moorings and orientations of political parties are spurious. Since many come from opposite ideological orientations and actions, it has taken a long time for them to internalise political culture. Even the NC, the so-called grand old party of liberal democracy, has derailed the system by making unholy alliances to remain in power. Although no party can become a purist in today’s political churnings, the NC could have become a role model in laying the foundation of democracy. But its leaders are as self-seeking as others. In the post-1990 multiparty era and under the present Republican dispensation, the NC has failed to show its distinct identity, rather indulging in self-aggrandisement and misgovernance. Changes of governments under any pretext and parroting the rhetoric of democratic credibility would not suffice in the uncanny political context. The second is the crisis of leadership. Most parties’ leaders have been tested by people who perceive them as lacking vision, commitment and determination to advance the agendas of progress. The same leaders who have forfeited public trust are lured by the posts and power. They have allowed the system to rot by indulging in pastime politics, rendering the people silent spectators. Leaders are generally neither transformatory nor honest while discharging their duties in government and opposition. Since leadership is a crucial variable in the early phase of political evolution and change in all dimensions, Nepali leaders even fail to be transactional. They take pride in becoming prime ministers many times without leaving behind the imprints of their governance. Third, the absurdity is begotten by the failures to put institutions on track, as many institutions created by the constitution or others outside it are spoiled by excessive politicisation in the respective parties’ lines. So, institutions are virtually lifeless and hardly generate the popular faith in leadership with which the system needs to revolve. Finally, experiences over the years have shown that opportunistic politics do not allow coalition governments to last for a fixed term because Nepali parties are not made for coalition politics. \nAccording to recent statistics from the World Bank (2023), the unemployment rate among the youth labour force (ages 15-24) in Nepal is 21 percent, a slight increase from 20 percent in 2017. This rate is higher than the regional average. Additionally, older statistics from the International Labour Organisation indicate that approximately 26.1 percent of university graduates in Nepal are unemployed. Most of these graduates are employed in routine jobs. With the advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), many of these positions are at risk of being replaced by AI and automation. As it is often said, \"AI won’t replace humans, but humans with AI will replace humans without AI.” Despite this precarious situation, Nepal is home to an aspirational youth population eager to establish themselves in the growing domestic and foreign economies. These youths need employable skills relevant to today's digital and AI-driven world to climb the economic ladder.As global digitalisation and the adoption of AI and data science transform various sectors, the demand for new skill sets is increasing both nationally and internationally. Organisations are becoming more AI-driven, rendering many traditional job roles obsolete. Consequently, students worldwide must acquire AI skills to remain competitive in the future job market. This trend is particularly relevant for Nepal's Higher Education Institutions (HEIs), where there is a significant data science and AI skills gap. Data science combines mathematics, statistics, specialised programming, advanced analytics, AI and machine learning to uncover actionable insights hidden within organisational data. Based on our interactions with students and corporate entities in Nepal, this piece examines the pressing need to integrate data science and AI into Nepal’s HEIs curriculum. Given the low employability rate among university graduates in Nepal, it is imperative to equip them with these essential skills. Best practicesAddressing these issues requires significant interventions at both policy and strategic levels. India's example reveals a massive impetus from government and private stakeholders on AI skilling over the past several years. Numerous skilling programmes on data science are available in India, ranging from secondary schooling to doctoral levels. Under government initiatives like Skill India, large-scale programmes have been completed and are ongoing to reskill and upskill the workforce in these areas. For instance, many Indian states have introduced Python programming as a compulsory or elective course in secondary school curricula to expose young minds to AI and data skills. Likewise, AI-related courses are going to be added to China’s education system, including primary and secondary schools.What needs to be doneA similar curriculum intervention is necessary in Nepal to cultivate young Nepali minds with data and programming skills for future AI roles. Currently, only a few top-notch business schools in Nepal have incorporated Python coding into their curriculum. However, this practice is not widespread. For undergraduate and graduate curricula across all professional HEI courses in Nepal, introducing data science skills in applied statistics, R programming, Python programming, SQL, data visualisation (using tools like Tableau), machine learning, and deep learning is essential. Additionally, each data science course should include at least one compulsory industry guest lecture (physical or online) from AI or data science experts, whether from Nepal or globally. This will ensure that students know the latest AI trends relevant to the industry.Furthermore, there should be more industry-academia collaborative projects wherein industries can offer real-time data science challenges to students through physical and virtual hackathons. From the perspective of skilling HEI educators, upskilling and Faculty Development Programmes (FDP) should be organised to familiarise them with the latest data science and AI tools. Such programmes should be incentivised to motivate educators to engage actively and learn from these opportunities. Educators skilled in these programmes should be encouraged to work on research projects connecting AI to their field of expertise, with the aim of filing patents or copyrights or publishing them in reputable journals. As the world transitions from Industry 3.0 to Industry 4.0 and soon to Industry 5.0, Nepal must also move its industrial and economic sectors in the same direction using AI and data science.Implementing these interventions would gradually build a culture of AI, data science, and innovation among Nepal's student community, addressing the existing skill gap. Moreover, such initiatives would foster the growth of AI-powered startups in Nepal, providing solutions for various socio-economic and business challenges. Nepal's recent launch of a concept paper on the application and practice of AI is a welcome move. However, it is crucial to formulate how AI can be integrated into the curriculum to ensure that future graduates possess the necessary skills.In conclusion, by incorporating data science and AI into HEIs, Nepal can better prepare its students for the uncertain future job market and foster innovation and economic growth. \nDonald Trump was in Milwaukee on Monday to make final preparations for the Republican presidential nomination later this week after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt that he said presented an opportunity to bring the country together.Trump, 78, was holding a campaign rally on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania - a key state in the Nov. 5 election - when a 20-year-old man with an AR-15-style rifle got close enough to shoot at the former Republican president from a rooftop.One shot hit Trump’s upper right ear, leaving his face streaked with blood, but he was not severely wounded.“That reality is just setting in,” Trump told the Washington Examiner on Sunday. “I rarely look away from the crowd. Had I not done that in that moment, well, we would not be talking today, would we?”One person in the crowd was killed and two others wounded before Secret Service agents fatally shot the suspect.On Sunday, both Trump and President Joe Biden counseled calm and unity in a country whose a deep political divide has grown more pronounced during the presidential race.“There is no place in America for this kind of violence, for any violence ever. Period. No exceptions,” he said. “We can’t allow this violence to be normalized.”“The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” Biden said in a televised address from the Oval Office.World leaders condemned the attack, opens new tab, with British Prime Minister Keir Starmer saying he was “appalled by the shocking scenes” and French President Emanuel Macron calling the assassination attempt “a tragedy for our democracies”.Trump pumped his fist in the air several times on Sunday appearing to mouth the words “Fight! Fight! Fight!”, as he descended the stairs from his plane after arriving in Milwaukee, where he will accept his party’s formal nomination at the Republican National Convention on Thursday.“This is a chance to bring the whole country, even the whole world, together. The speech will be a lot different, a lot different than it would’ve been two days ago,” Trump told the Washington Examiner.“I want to try to unite our country,” the New York Post reported Trump saying during the same interview, conducted during the flight to Milwaukee. “But I don’t know if that’s possible. People are very divided.”Biden, a Democrat, ordered an independent review of how the gunman, who was shot dead by agents moments after opening fire, could have taken up an elevated position so close to Trump, who as a former president has lifetime protection by the US Secret Service.Biden and Trump spoke to each other on Saturday night after the shooting.The two are locked in a close election rematch, according to most opinion polls including by Reuters/Ipsos. The shooting on Saturday whipsawed discussion around the presidential campaign, which had been focused on whether Biden, 81, should drop out following a halting June 27 debate performance.Suspect a nursing home aideThe FBI identified Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, as the suspect and said the shooting was being investigated as an attempted assassination.FBI officials said on Sunday that the shooter acted alone.The agency said it had yet to identify an ideology linked to the suspect or any indications of mental health issues or found any threatening language on the suspect’s social media accounts.Crooks was a registered Republican, according to state voter records, and donated $15 to a Democratic political action committee when he was 17. At the time of the shooting, he was employed as a dietary aide at the Bethel Park Skilled Nursing and Rehabilitation Center, which said Crooks’ background check was clean.The gun - an AR-style-5.56 caliber rifle - had been legally bought, said FBI officials, who believed it had been purchased by the suspect’s father.The officials said “a suspicious device” was found in the suspect’s vehicle, which was inspected by bomb technicians and rendered safe.The Secret Service denied accusations by some Trump supporters that it had rejected a campaign request for more security.The shots on Saturday appeared to come from outside the area secured by the Secret Service, the agency said.Spectator killed protecting familyThe rally attendee killed on Saturday was identified by authorities as Corey Comperatore, 50, of Sarver, Pennsylvania. He died trying to protect his family from the hail of bullets, said Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro.Two people wounded in the shooting were in a stable condition on Sunday. Pennsylvania State identified them as David Dutch, 57, of New Kensington, Pennsylvania and James Copenhaver, 74, of Moon Township, Pennsylvania.The attack was the first shooting of a US president or major party presidential candidate since the 1981 attempted assassination of Republican President Ronald Reagan. \nA car bomb exploded outside a restaurant in Somalia’s capital Mogadishu on Sunday night, killing five and injuring 20 as patrons were watching the final of the Euro 2024 football tournament on TV, police said, blaming Islamist insurgents.The bomb destroyed 10 cars and damaged several buildings nearby in a well-guarded area near the Presidential Palace, a Reuters reporter said.Al Shabaab militants claimed responsibility for the attack on an affiliated radio station, saying the bombing targeted a place where security and government workers meet at night.The Islamist group, which once ruled much of Somalia, has been fighting for years to impose its strict interpretation of Islam on Somalia.The insurgents have frequently launched raids and deadly attacks in Mogadishu and other regions controlled by the federal government in the last two years, despite losing large swathes of territory to government forces and their allies. \nVarious countries, including India, the USA, the UK, and Pakistan on Monday congratulated Minister KP Sharma Oli on his appointment.They said they are looking forward to working together to strengthen ties between the two countries.Taking to X, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said he is looking forward to working closely to further strengthen the deep bonds of friendship.“Congratulations on your appointment as the prime minister of Nepal. Look forward to working closely to further strengthen the deep bonds of friendship between our two countries and to further expand our mutually beneficial cooperation for the progress and prosperity of our peoples,” Modi said in a post.Likewise, the US Ambassador to Nepal Dean R. Thompson also congratulated the prime minister.“We look forward to working with the new government of Nepal to further strengthen our 77-year partnership, said Thompson in a post on X.Similarly, the British Embassy in Kathmandu congratulated and extended best wishes to the prime minister.“We look forward to further strengthening our longstanding UK-Nepal relationship in the coming days,” it said in a post on X.Likewise, Pakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif congratulated Oli on taking oath as the prime minister of Nepal for the fourth time.“I wish him every success and look forward to working with him to further strengthen bilateral ties & promote regional cooperation between our two nations,” said Sharif.President Ramchandra Paudel on Sunday appointed CPN-UML Chairman Oli as the prime minister of Nepal. He, along with his 21 Cabinet ministers, took an oath of office and secrecy on Monday.This is Oli’s fourth stint as the country’s chief executive.First appointed the prime minister in October 2015 (until August 2016), Oli was head of the government from February 2018 to May 2021 and from May 2021 to July 2021. \nDefending champions Argentina won a record 16th Copa America title by beating Colombia 1-0 thanks to an extra-time goal from substitute Lautaro Martinez at the Hard Rock Stadium in Florida on Sunday.The game, which was delayed by more than an hour after thousands of fans without tickets tried to enter the stadium, was a cagey affair over 90 minutes but opened up in the extra period.Martinez, the tournament’s leading scorer, latched onto a precise through ball from Giovani Lo Celso before lifting his effort over advancing Colombia goalkeeper Camilo Vargas in the 112nd minute to spark wild celebrations among Argentina fans.Argentina’s latest title comes on the back of their triumphs at the 2022 World Cup and 2021 Copa America, and gives eight-times Ballon d’Or winner Lionel Messi the perfect sendoff in what is likely his last international tournament.Colombia started the match by pressing high up the pitch and Jhon Cordoba hit the post in the seventh minute before Jefferson Lerma and Richard Rios had long-range efforts saved by Argentina goalkeeper Emiliano Martinez.Messi appeared to hurt his ankle in the 36th minute after a collision with Santiago Arias and while he got back to his feet after receiving treatment he was clearly hampered for the remainder of the half.Colombia went on the offensive again in the second half with Arias and Davinson Sanchez coming close to scoring.Argentina soaked up the pressure well but were dealt a blow in the 66th minute when Messi limped off due to the ankle injury.They continued to grew into the contest and had a goal disallowed for offside but Colombia held on as the match went to extra time.The defending champions continued to push forward in extra time, testing Vargas with a shot from Nico Gonzalez before Martinez finally found the breakthrough.Argentina’s win also ended a record 28-match unbeaten streak for Colombia, whose last defeat also came against ‘La Albiceleste’ in February 2022. \nRescuers have recovered the bodies of 11 people during the search for the passengers missing since Friday’s accident. However, the identities of four of them are yet to be ascertained.Authorities had found two bodies, stuck at the Gandak barrage in Triveni Dham late on Sunday. Two of the sluice gates were closed to retrieve the bodies on Monday, said Mahesh Rayamajhi, head of the Triveni police office.According to the Chitwan district police office, the victims have been identified as a 22-year-old man from ward 22 of the Bharatpur Metropolitan City and a 17-year-old boy from Jamunamai of Rautahat district.They were travelling on the Kathmandu-bound Angel Deluxe bus and Ganapati Deluxe bus, en route to Gaur from the Capital, respectively.Sixty-two people went missing after two passenger buses were swept away by a mudslide into the rain-swollen Trishuli River near Simaltal along the Narayanghat-Mugling road section at around 3:30am on Friday.According to Chitwan Chief District Officer Indradev Yadav, 27 passengers’ names were recorded at the ticket counter of the bus travelling to Gaur from Kathmandu. Yadav said it had been confirmed that 11 more people were travelling on the bus, according to their relatives.A total of 23 passengers were on the bus en route to Kathmandu from Birgunj, as per the record maintained at the ticket counter. Four more people were on board the bus as per their relatives, said Yadav.Three of the passengers on the Ganapati Deluxe bus had managed to escape after jumping out of the vehicle. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy today. Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several parts of the country.Tonight, the weather is expected to remain generally cloudy throughout the country, with light to moderate rainfall.Likewise, moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely to occur at some places in Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province, as well as at one or two places in the rest of the provinces.Heavy rainfall is expected in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.The maximum temperature on Sunday was recorded at 36.4 degrees Celsius in Dhangadi, while Jomsom’s lowest recorded temperature was 15.5 degrees Celsius. \nImports from China to Nepal rose more sharply than expected in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year ending mid-June, while imports from India continued to tumble.According to the Trade and Export Promotion Center, the national trade promotion body, Nepal’s imports from China increased by 34.8 percent in the review period. In comparison, imports from India fell by 3.1 percent.Experts attributed ballooning imports from China to a sharp rise in the entry of electric vehicles (EVs). Likewise, a fall in imports from India has been attributed to the export curbs on food by the southern neighbour. In terms of value, imports from China increased by Rs70.44 billion to Rs272.81 billion in the review period.Import from India, however, dropped by Rs29.53 billion to Rs908.30 billion in the period.Due to the drop in imports from India, Nepal’s total imports declined 1.8 percent to Rs1.45 trillion in the first eleven months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June 2024.An official of the National Statistics Office says for a consumption-driven economy, falling imports are a worrisome sign. This suggests people are spending less on services and consumption while exports are stagnant.Rabindra Duwadi, the spokesperson at the Trade and Export Promotion Center, said imports from the north were driven by a massive influx of EVs, smartphones, and readymade garments.Besides, exports of iron, chemical fertiliser, apples and readymade garments too rose significantly. Traders said that China fulfils 80 percent of Nepal's readymade garment needs. The country imported readymade garments worth Rs33.67 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year.In the same vein, Nepal imported 7,931 EVs worth Rs21.83 billion from China in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, up from 1,269 EVs worth Rs3.75 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the country imported 1.23 million units of smartphones worth Rs17.27 billion from China in the review period. During the time, Nepal imported 99,965 tonnes of chemical fertiliser worth Rs8.69 billion from China.In the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, the country imported 65,827 tonnes of apples worth Rs6.98 billion from China, compared to 50,153 tonnes worth Rs4.73 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Duwadi said India’s share of Nepal’s total imports is 65.5 percent, while China contributes 18.8 percent. Traders say Nepal’s trade with India is vast, but it is steadily shifting to China. “One key reason for import growth from China is EVs,” said Rajan Sharma, a trade expert. “Chinese EVs are comparatively cheaper and perform better compared to Indian ones.” According to market observers, that’s why there has been an abrupt switch from India’s Tata Nexon EV to Chinese BYD.Sharma said readymade garments imported from China are cheaper compared to Indian readymade garments, including branded ones, which makes them popular among Nepali customers. “At the same time, India-made branded clothing items are expensive.”The Chinese Shein clothing brand has quickly gained popularity in Nepal due to its trendy clothes and reasonable prices.Trade experts say that due to the open border, there has been a massive rise in informal trade from India in recent years. Smuggling has thrived after India imposed a ban on foods.According to a research report titled, ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, only 40 percent of rice is imported from India through formal channels.India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the share of informal trade is likely to be higher.The research has pointed out that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, resulting in a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.The paper said that India’s ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Nepal is dependent on onions imported from India. When the Indian government imposed a ban on onion exports from December 2023 to May 2024, the product was readily available in the vegetable market and grocery stores, which indicated that a massive quantity of onions came through informal trade channels.The government did not take a single step to control the illegal trade or negotiate with the Indian government to ease the repeated bans on export of various agricultural goods. Nepal has thus lost out on huge import revenue as goods are coming to Nepal through illegal channels and are easily available in the market.Paras Kharel, executive director of the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment, said overall imports have not been able to rebound in two fiscal years, reflecting the country’s economic slowdown. However, the rise in EV imports contributed to the sudden rise in imports from China.“Imports from Tatopani and Rasuwa customs rose by twice as much,” Kharel said. This shows that imports from China, which were halted after the Covid pandemic, are not gradually improving but are ballooning.According to the Department of Customs, the worth of imports from Tatopani customs increased to Rs37.16 billion in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, compared to Rs11.79 billion in the same period last fiscal year.Similarly, the worth of imports from Rasuwa customs on the northern border increased to Rs55.45 billion in the review period, up from Rs27.25 billion in the same period last fiscal year. \nThe National Human Rights Commission has said that the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act must include war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights while also ensuring justice to former Maoist child soldiers.The constitutional human rights watchdog made its position public as the three major parties worked to finalise the amendment bill to the Act under consideration in a parliamentary committee. Neither the existing Act nor the amendment bill includes war crimes, crimes against humanity and the issues of child combatants. In its report “The National Human Rights Commission and Transitional Justice”, the commission has said that together with murder, enforced disappearance, abduction or disappearances after the kidnapping, torture, rape or other sexual violence, war crimes and crimes against humanity should also be classified as non-amnestiable crimes.The 150-page report the commission is set to unveil on Monday includes its position on the long-pending transitional justice process while also documenting the efforts it made to deliver justice to the war-era victims of human rights violations. Since its establishment in 2002, the commission has investigated 1,073 cases related to the 1996-2006 insurgency and recommended actions against 222 including former Home Secretary and chief of Nepal Police.Following successive governments’ reluctance to follow its recommendations, the commission made public the list of perpetrators in October 2020 and January 2024.The leaders in negotiation are still struggling to finalise whether to list murder as a serious violation of human rights. Despite long negotiations, they have yet to sort out issues of minor Maoist soldiers and sentence reduction. They are also divided on whether victims who refuse to reconcile should be allowed to take their cases to court.The commission’s report says killing any unarmed individual, regardless of their involvement in the conflict, or those not directly involved in the fight, is a serious violation of human rights. There cannot be amnesty for serious violations of human rights, including war crimes and crimes against humanity. Amnesty for other human rights violations is possible only with the written consent of the victims, according to the commission.“Those who refuse pardon should be allowed to seek legal remedy as per the existing laws,” reads the report. “The truth and Reconciliation Commission must delve into the cases of the victims who lost their lives or got injured in landmines planted during the insurgency even after the peace process began.” Issues of child Maoist combatants must be addressed through the law to ensure they get justice, according to the commission.The use of minors in armed conflict is a war crime as per international law. The ruling Maoist Centre, therefore, does not want to include this issue in the law.During the verification process for army integration conducted by UNMIN in 2007, thousands of Maoist fighters had been disqualified for being minors. Among the 4,008 combatants who did not qualify for integration, 2,973 were verified as minors, while the remaining 1,035 had joined the Maoist ‘People’s Liberation Army’ after the first ceasefire of May 26, 2006—six months before the signing of the peace deal. The government had provided between Rs500,000 and Rs800,000 each to the combatants who chose voluntary retirement. However, those who were disqualified didn’t get any substantial support, except for a few thousand rupees from the United Nations.A group of former child soldiers led by Lenin Bista have filed a writ petition at the Supreme Court demanding the prosecution of the then Maoist supreme commander Pushpa Kamal Dahal, now the country’s prime minister, and the then ‘people’s government’ chief Baburam Bhattarai, who also is a former prime minister. The final hearing for the petition has been slated for September.Unlike in other issues, the commission has stood with the political parties on reduced sentencing. “The jail term of convicts who meet the criteria [perpetrators cooperating in the investigation process], can be reduced to a minimum of 25 percent as per existing laws,” reads the report. “The criteria for reduced sentencing can be defined in the law.” Surya Dhungel, a commissioner, said their position is based on international practice where reduced sentencing is common in transitional justice process.The commission has also reiterated that it will send its representative to the panel formed to recommend office bearers in the two transitional justice mechanisms only if there is a commitment from the parties concerned to amend the Act. “We are firm in our decision. Commitment from top political leadership is a must for the commission to send its representative to the recommendation committee,” said Dhungel. \nIn the early 1980s, Nepal’s firebrand communist leader, Mohan Bikram Singh, split from his comrade Nirmal Lama to establish a radical political alternative. Lama and Singh had earlier revolted from the Communist Party of Nepal to establish their own faction after the party’s fourth convention in 1974. Among Singh’s trusted leaders were Mohan Baidya, Pushpa Kamal Dahal, CP Gajurel and Dev Gurung. But Singh was forced to spend most of the following years politically exiled in India. As a result, Baidya effectively captured the party, renaming it the Communist Party of Nepal (CPN), “Mashal,” pronounced slightly different from Lama’s CPN “Masal.” However, Baidya and many senior party leaders faced self-imposed demotion after the party suffered a strategic setback in the now infamous ‘Sector Scandal’. Baidya was forced to nominate Dahal as the party leader in 1989, a position Dahal has held for three and a half decades.During the first two decades of his leadership, Dahal reigned supreme, as his party led the country into a decade-long violent political conflict that claimed, by some estimates, over 16,000 lives. Despite substantial economic and political costs, the conflict accelerated Nepal’s transition from a semi-feudal society with an exclusive political system into a more inclusive and secular republic. To that end, the Dahal-led Maoist party received due recognition through a popular mandate of the 2008 first Constituent Assembly elections. But Dahal’s unnecessary distrust of Nepal’s more established political parties, which had played a considerable role in bringing his party back into the political mainstream, made him commit blunders and unseated him from a comfortable majority government. His suspicion against fellow comrades who questioned his leadership style and decisions led to multiple splintering of the Maoist party. An insecure leaderDespite leading the country in and out of a transformative political conflict and becoming one of the key signatories of the new constitution, Dahal has remained an insecure leader who takes every opportunity to remind the Nepali people and the world about his “revolutionary contributions”. Possibly, this deep-seated insecurity emerges from the fact that he is neither seen as an intellectually gifted politician like his fellow comrade Baburam Bhattarai, who is known as an ideologue of the Maoist conflict or as a leader with integrity and simplicity like that of his political gurus Singh and Baidya. The thought of losing the political legacy of the ‘People’s War’ despite clinging onto the leadership of the party must constantly haunt the Maoist supremo.Dahal’s insecurity and political hypocrisy were also palpable in the way he derided the Madhesh Movement, which also raised the agendas of federalism and inclusion. Instead of considering them allies, Dahal ordered his party cadres to attack the Madheshi party leaders and their cadres. A large part of the political onus of escalating the tensions leading to the unfortunate Gaur massacre in 2007 will always rest on Dahal. Over the past decade and a half, Dahal has repeatedly failed to display the leadership he is ironically fond of discussing. Despite mobilising thousands of Tharu youths during the conflict, he failed to support their genuine claims on provincial boundaries during the federal structuring. And despite claims of his ‘one-sided love’ for Madhesh, he remained silent as more than 50 Madhesi protesters were indiscriminately killed by the security forces in 2015. Unreliable coalition partnerThere was a time when Dahal led a party that had shaken the country’s political core. Less than two decades later, he now leads a party that has mostly eroded its political base and only relies on a stronger coalition partner to remain relevant. But has Dahal even proved to be a reliable coalition partner? Let’s take a closer look. After Baidya split the party in 2012, the CPN-Maoist was reduced to the third position in the second Constituent Assembly elections, a significant loss from its commanding majority in the first CA. In the following two years, Dahal’s party was not only kept out of power but also forced to endorse a constitution that the Nepali Congress and rival communist party CPN-UML tabled. Having lost the capacity to dictate the political course, Dahal resorted to coalition politics. When the opportunity came, he supported UML’s Khadga Prasad Oli to cobble up a coalition government in October 2015. However, when the Nepali Congress offered him to lead a new coalition, he abandoned Oli and became Prime Minister in 2016. With the 2017 elections on the horizon, Dahal knew his party would not be able to compete with the larger parties that had successfully led the constitution drafting. With some active external mediation, Dahal persuaded Oli for an electoral alliance and even agreed to an eventual unification of the communist forces. When the left unity won a landslide victory, Dahal was convinced that Oli would honour the agreement to hand over power to him mid-way through the four-year period. When Oli refused, he split the united CPN in 2020, convincing several disgruntled leaders like Madhav Nepal to abandon the party and join a coalition with the Nepali Congress. The new coalition also offered Dahal and his party a comfortable division of electoral seats in the 2022 local, provincial and federal elections. But soon after the elections were over, Dahal bargained for power with both Deuba and Oli. Despite having won only 32 seats in the federal parliament with only 11 percent popular vote, Dahal managed to become Nepal’s 33rd Prime Minister in December 2022.Impending downfallIn 2014, political analyst CK Lal had told me that Dahal’s political opportunism would make him relevant in Nepali politics for at least another decade. The Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML took exactly a decade to realise that Dahal had been cashing in on Nepal’s fractured politics. This week, the two parties agreed that Nepal’s long-term political stability requires an introspection into the present electoral system, which allows electorally less popular outfits to dictate the course of national politics. So, not only have the two large parties decided to pull the plug on the Dahal government, but they also agreed to form an independent commission to study and propose amendments to the current electoral provision.While there is little disagreement that the current electoral system paved the way for more representation of the hitherto marginalised sections, the opportunity to correct inefficacies like expensive election campaigning and manipulation of the proportional candidacy lists by the parties must not be dismissed either. There are also serious doubts about the intention of the two parties to strike a deal at a time when the Nepal Police and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority are investigating some high-profile corruption cases. It is up to the two parties to vindicate their intent by ensuring that the new political course does not interfere in these investigations. And even if the two parties agree to amend the constitutional provisions regarding elections, they will need to gather a national consensus or at least a two-thirds majority. Whatever happens in the next few weeks and months, it is evidently clear Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s eventual political downfall is on the horizon. \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) has warned that Nepal’s economy, still reeling from subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs, may face an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook, mainly due to fragile political stability and cooperatives failure.The global lender, which provides policy advice and financing to its members to foster growth and financial stability, said Nepal’s fragile political stability could disrupt policy continuity and reform implementation. Nepal is set to elect the new prime minister next week. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is almost certain to fail the trust vote. This will be his fifth trust vote in a year and a half. The CPN-UML withdrew its support to the government on July 3 after it ditched its coalition with the CPN (Maoist Centre) and joined hands with the Nepali Congress to form a new government.This is the fourth time in Nepal’s political history that two major parties are forming a government without a powerful opposition, which observers say weakens democracy's effective functioning.On Tuesday, the IMF completed the fourth review under its four‑year extended credit facility, allowing Nepal to withdraw $41.3 million to help the country's economic recovery.This brings total disbursements under the extended credit facility for budget support to $247.7 million.The IMF executive board approved the extended credit facility arrangement for Nepal on January 12, 2022. The approved amount totals $371.6 million, which is 180 percent of Nepal’s special drawing rights quota (SDR) of 282.42 million.“Nepal’s economy continues to face challenges,” said the statement issued by the IMF on Thursday. It said that Nepal’s growth projected at 3 percent in the fiscal year 2023-24 remains below potential due to subdued domestic demand and post‑pandemic balance sheet repairs. The IMF has talked about Nepal’s cooperatives sector for the first time.In the statement, the IMF warned about the intensification of financial sector vulnerabilities, such as a further rise in non-performing loans. In this context, “more failures of cooperative lenders could endanger the banking system's soundness,” the IMF said.According to experts and bankers interviewed by the Post, cooperatives, which the government once embraced as one of the three pillars of the economy, are now threatening the economy.In Nepal, millions of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are heavily involved in cooperatives, and their failure could not only damage the fragile economy, but also harm social harmony, say experts. Cooperatives are involved in sectors ranging from dairy and livestock to tailoring and retail.Recently, thousands of victims of cooperatives fraud have staged protests in various parts of the country, demanding the return of deposits embezzled by cooperative operators. Hundreds of such depositors came to Kathmandu and staged protests. The government recently signed an agreement with them, promising to solve their problems as soon as possible.“The problem in the cooperative sector will shake up the banking sector. But if there is a wise move, the banking sector can absorb the shock,” said Upendra Poudyal, president of the Confederation of Banks and Financial Institutions Nepal. He said that the regulation of cooperatives has already been delayed. “We have seen that cooperatives are being operated for personal gains. A limited number of people took the benefit.” “Now, the central bank should begin with a single threshold. Limit the number and start supervision.” As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. The deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. They currently employ 94,000 people.In a recent interview, Kashi Raj Dahal, immediate past chairman of the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a government agency, told the Post that globally, most cooperatives work in productive sectors like food production, dairy, fruits and other agricultural activities. “But in Nepal, around 25,000 cooperatives are involved only in financial activities, mainly collecting deposits and issuing loans. Such cooperatives are now in crisis. Over 15,000 are registered to collect deposits. Even others registered as multi-purpose cooperatives primarily engage in savings and credits. Around 500 cooperatives are currently in trouble.”The Dahal-led government has promised the return of at least Rs500,000 to each depositor by recovering it from the directors' assets. Yet doubts persist about whether depositors will get back their money. Some economists have warned about potential mass protests if the cooperatives issue is not taken seriously.The IMF has also warned that the failure to raise the execution rate of large-scale projects would deprive the economy of much-needed stimulus and weigh on growth. On the pessimistic side, the IMF said that economic activity is expected to increase, reaching 4.9 percent in 2024-25, supported by more robust domestic demand. The statement reads that the cautiously accommodative monetary policy stance, the planned increase in capital expenditures in the 2024-25 budget, additional hydropower generation, and a continued rise in tourist arrivals are expected to boost domestic demand and growth. Inflation is expected to remain within the Nepal Rastra Bank’s (NRB) target ceiling of 5.5 percent.“Nepal has made important strides on its economic reform agenda. Decisive actions in monetary policy, bank regulation and rolling off Covid support policies played a major role in overcoming urgent balance of payments pressure in 2021-22,” said Bo Li, deputy managing director of IMF. “Reserves continue to rise without the need to use distortive import restrictions. Despite revenue shortfalls, fiscal discipline was maintained in 2022-23 and 2023-24. Bank supervision and regulation have improved by rolling out new supervisory information systems. Nepal’s medium-term outlook remains favourable as strategic investments in infrastructure, especially in the energy sector, are expected to support potential growth.”The IMF said that strengthening public investment management would support the needed boost to capital spending. Enhancing fiscal transparency will help contain fiscal risks and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability.“As monetary policy transmission is still weak in a context of balance sheet repair, a cautious and data-dependent monetary policy remains appropriate to preserve price and external stability,” the IMF said.  \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\n\nSri Lanka’s rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences make it one of the world’s best holiday destinations. The most common sight across the island nation is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure—a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use. Despite being cash-strapped and plunging into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back, thanks to the growing number of tourists. We spent five days in the island country two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Following the trip spanning over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites, the Post presents a travel guide to Sri Lanka. \nWritten by philosophy enthusiast Bishnu Sapkota, ‘Adiyeka Paila’ is a novel that explains the complicated dynamics of feelings in human relationships. Astitwa and Anasuya are the protagonists of the novel. Another character of the story, Bandana, stands to be the deuteragonist. And no, the book is not about the love triangle. Instead, it is about a candid narration of each character's feelings, which ultimately shape their life. Astitwa is introduced as a university teacher of Kirtipur. He teaches English literature to university students. Anasuya is an MBBS student. Astitwa and Anasuya meet through Anusaya’s father, Mani, a professor at Kirtipur University. To assist Astitwa with completing his thesis, Astitwa’s friend Pramod advises him to coordinate with Mani. Their first interaction is similar to the novel ‘Lolita’ setting. Astitwa, in his 20s, is seven years older than Anusuya, who is still a minor.Anasuya instantly falls for Astitwa upon seeing him in her house. Additionally, as an MBBS student passionate about literature, it's easy to see why Anasuya would develop an infatuation with someone knowledgeable, single, and a literature lover like herself.The pair starts going on dates, and their conversation often concerns philosophically defining love. Astitwa’s take on love combines all the principles he has absorbed as a university student. Contrary to this, Anasuya is introverted in expressing herself yet bolder and wiser when approaching matters of love. She postulates that love has little to do with rationality and reasoning. However, Astitwa states, “Love was made to ease the complexities of navigating societal norms and emotional landscapes. Therefore, there is no guarantee that tomorrow love will not wither.” The author has effectively assessed the maturity levels between boys and girls in love. His analysis addresses the widely debated and often clichéd notion that girls generally show more maturity than boys.The journey of their attraction blooming into love is characterised by beautiful butterfly moments that aren’t discussed in depth in other books I have read. The discourse surrounding such intricate details assures the reader like it has assured me, that it is expected to fixate on the qualities of someone you admire. The following dialogue perfectly captures the essence of one’s obsession. “After all, everyone is made up of the elements of feelings. No matter how many logical arguments we make, our actions are driven by our emotions”. The entire plot of the novel rests on a single premise, much like in movies, where an actor portrays various characters in different films, the roles in the novel shift and change based on the circumstances and contexts the characters face.Similarly, human beings play various roles in their own lives. Our existence is dynamic and multifaceted, enabling us to embody different versions of ourselves as we navigate different phases and experiences.The author’s background as a columnist may have inspired the progression of social issues in the novel. Astitwa’s students, Bandana and Mohan, are victims of the repercussions of the Maoist Conflict in Nepal. Mohan, a member of the Madhesi community, moves to Kathmandu to study for his master's. Once there, he gains a clearer perspective on the silent discrimination his community faces.An article by JB Pun Magar on the topic ‘Manu Smriti, Muluki Ain and the rise of Bahuns’ rightly captures the dilemma that Mohan faces regarding the accusations of the ruling caste where they maintain that indigenous people incite division with ethnicity-based federalism. At the same time, the indigenous people contend that the ruling class perpetuates racism through historical privilege and marginalisation of ethnic communities. Similarly, Bandana, who has lost her father during the Maoist insurgency, confides in Astitwa regarding her struggles with the grief of losing a parent. However, the bond that Anasuya and Astiwa share isn’t love, as the author mentions through his exaggerated explanation of love, feelings, and rationality.Either one has attachment issues, or, in modern language, they are in a “situationship”. The novel is slow running in its pace yet steadfast in developing new arcs in the plot. Before Bandana, Astitwa and Anasuya had already stopped talking to each other. This incident not only takes a toll on Anusuya's mental health but also disrupts her relationship with her parents.The fallout occurs because Astitwa insists that Anasuya reveal their relationship to her parents. Despite her opposition, Anasuya complies with her boyfriend's demands.Her parents are not entirely opposed to this new information, yet it is a task for them, especially the father, to accept that his daughter will grow up to be an adult. As the story unfolds, Astistwa receives a scholarship for his PhD program from Notre Dame University, one of the most prestigious universities in the US. After spending nearly six years in the US, Astitwa returned to Nepal despite the opposition of his colleagues from Kirtipur who had settled abroad.At this particular juncture, the author has painted the picture of the stark realities faced by many Nepali students studying abroad. The novel does not conclude with a typical Cinderella ending, where estranged lovers reconcile. Instead, it features a mature and unconventional ending, allowing readers to uncover the explanation as the story progresses gradually.However, the novel’s characters stand to be romantic and slightly idealised, which makes it difficult for an ordinary reader to fully encapsulate the duality and complexities portrayed by the author. In hindsight, the novel is an excellent portrayal of one’s deepest feelings, which are layered by the principles and conventions built by society around us. Through the characters, the author urges the readers never to eschew the inevitable waves of emotions that shape our deepest selves. Drawing from his experience living abroad, the author implies the importance of culture and native language in authentically expressing one’s emotions.Adiyeka PailaAuthor: Bishnu SapkotaPublisher: Fine PrintYear:2023 \nWithin the rich heritage of Newa art, you might have heard of Paubha or Thanka, two types of cloth painting known for their religious iconography. Many tourists leave Nepal with at least one of the two tucked away in their suitcases, hoping to hang a unique reminder of their travels on their walls. But for foreigners and Nepalis alike, few have heard of Bilampau, an elusive narrative art style that may have been inspired by Paubha. Bilampau in Newa means horizontal painting.Though Paubha is a much more established and recognisable Newa art form, both Paubha and Bilampau are scroll paintings guided by Thyaa-saphu, folded sketchbooks that were kept by Newa families. Thyaa-saphu stipulates necessary thematic and narrative elements for Buddhist stories; Bilampau, for example, often begins with the figure of the narrator themselves, whether it be Lord Buddha—common in Buddhist scroll paintings—or Lord Ganesha, in the case of Hindu stories.But Madan Chitrakar, renowned artist, researcher, and scholar, reveals that the similarities between Paubha and Bilampau largely end there. “The subject matter and motifs are very different,” he says. While Paubha’s religious characteristics support meditation and worship, the importance of storytelling is prominent in Bilampau and its “narrative scroll” composition. Unlike Paubha, Bilampau depicts stories with multiple elements and episodes. This sequence is often established through a collection of frames on one scroll, though some Bilampau artworks utilise a single scroll without frame-by-frame separation. Swosti Rajbhandari Kayastha, museologist, curator for Nepal Art Council, and curator of the current Itumbaha museum exhibition, emphasises that Bilampau are not meant for veneration. “In ancient times, they didn’t have comic books, right?” she jokes. Instead, visual storytelling was done through creations like Bilampau.On June 18, 2024, Siddhartha Art Gallery opened its doors to the public for its most recent exhibition on Kalighat paintings, Ganjifa playing cards, and Bilampau. Though the gallery certainly focused on the legacy of Kalighat, all three art forms underscore the unique cultural ties between Nepal and India.At the opening, artist Chitrakar also spoke on the significance of Bilampau, calling it one of the most “misunderstood” forms in Nepali art history.What does it mean to truly understand an art form? And when it comes to the expansive depths of art history, what does it mean to remember an art form in its entirety? How can we revive a dying art form back into the collective consciousness of the twenty-first century?The earliest existence of the visual narrative technique in Nepal can be traced back to the 12th century, depicted not through scroll but through wood. Newa artists were also likely commissioned to create Bilampau for specific walls in Buddhist temples, hence its impressive horizontal length. Indeed, Bilampau also holds some surprising diversity in sizes and dimensions, with many ranging from nine feet to a whopping 78 feet in length—a testament to its visual significance.Comparisons can also be drawn between Bilampau and Patachitra, a cloth painting form based in West Bengal, Odisha, and Rajasthan. Both Bilampau and Patachitra were created by Chitrakar artists in India and Nepal, and the two forms also share a reputation for story-telling. However, Bilampau is more commonly horizontal, while Patachitra is typically vertical in its episodic visualisation.It is possible that Bilampau grew into its own art form from the influence of Patachitra, signifying another historical connection between India and Nepal, but so little is known about the evolution of Bilampau that it is difficult to come to a precise conclusion about its origins.Today, most traditional Buddhist Bilampau are kept in local monasteries. According to Chitrakar, one of the most famous Bilampau is currently held in Itum Bahal. Kayastha notes that the Bilampau in Itum Bahal depicts the foundation of the Itum Bahal monastery.During the Newa Gunla festival, which is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, the significance of Bilampau storytelling is also treasured amongst Vihara and Newa Buddhists. “For fifteen days,” Kayastha explains, “all the monasteries will display the objects they have in their storage, which people have donated over time. One of those objects would be the Bilampau.” Kayastha highlights that the Bilampau is not only a source of education regarding the monastery’s history but also a source of community engagement. Members of the community take it upon themselves to safeguard their heritage and cultural objects, usually sleeping in the same room as the Bilampau and other artefacts.At Siddhartha Art Gallery, there are two Bilampau, both depicting Hindu stories; due to the artistic shift towards Hinduism, the older Bilampau, consisting largely of Buddhist stories, is much less accessible.Bilampau is no longer an active form in traditional Nepali art, which means that truly understanding its significance also begets recognising its disappearance from popular Nepali art discourse. Despite being one of the earliest forms of visual story-telling in Nepal, “it is almost forgotten,” remarks Chitrakar.A quick Google search of ‘Bilampau’ results few substantial results except for a single scholarly article written by Chitrakar himself.The fear of this art form growing obsolete extends far beyond art history, just as art history itself holds broader implications on the importance of culture and identity.In Nepal, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal declared that the country’s citizens share a common responsibility to protect traditional Indigenous culture, calling it the “identity and prestige” of Nepal as a whole.Traditional festivals and art forms are certainly still celebrated and recognised, whether it be on the streets of Kathmandu or within one of the city’s museums or galleries, but several artisans and scholars have shared their growing concerns about the future of traditional Nepali art.Many artists from the older generation, for example, fear that the younger generation will no longer continue the artistic practices—such as Paubha painting—that their families have inherited for generations.We must take it upon ourselves to raise awareness and actively engage with the artists and cultural significance that accompanies these forms—otherwise, our collective apathy might result in these traditions reaching the same untimely fate as Bilampau.Though Bilampau died out a century ago, one method of reviving its presence might entail a call for collectors to bring their Bilampau pieces forward, increasing public accessibility. For others, simply talking about Bilampau and remembering its place in history might be more than enough.“When we talk about Nepali art traditions,” says Chitrakar, “we must not miss Bilampau,” echoing the value in appreciating a lesser-known art form. And when we remember Bilampau, we must also hold on to the other art forms that are still surviving, carrying legacies that have spanned across entire wars, nations, and generations—and, if all goes well, with many more journeys to come. \nOn July 1, the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML reached a deal to form the government with KP Sharma Oli, the UML chairperson, taking the prime ministerial seat first. That would be possible in a coalition formed as per Article 76 (2) of the Constitution of Nepal.While the Congress and the UML were confident that Article 76 (2) would be invoked as the President invited the parties to form the new government, outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s CPN (Maoist Centre) had been claiming that the government formation process should be shifted to Article 76 (3). Maoist leaders repeatedly claimed in and outside Parliament that as the Dahal government was formed as per Article 76 (2), his successor should be appointed under Article 76 (3).Article 76 (3) coming into play meant Oli would not become the prime minister this time, as the constitutional provision pertains to a minority government led by the largest party. Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, as the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House of Representatives, would become the prime minister. On July 3, the UML recalled its ministers while also withdrawing its support to the Dahal government. The prime minister was then left with two options: resign or face the House.Despite knowing that he would lose the confidence motion, Dahal opted for the vote. That was because he believed the President would initiate a new government formation process under Article 76 (3) after he lost the trust vote.Article 76 (3) says in cases where the prime minister of a coalition government fails to win the confidence of Parliament, the President appoints the parliamentary party leader of the largest party in the House as prime minister. “Our party believed that Article 76 (3) would be invoked after the prime minister lost the vote of trust. This is why he [Dahal] chose the vote of confidence instead of resigning,” an office bearer of the Maoist Centre told the Post. However, President Ramchandra Paudel, hours after Dahal lost the floor test on Friday evening, called two or more parties to stake a claim to the government as per Article 76 (2). Paudel had consulted some constitutional experts before making the call. All the experts except one had suggested that he go for a coalition government—rather than a minority one—citing the Supreme Court’s rulings. They were of the opinion that there is no constitutional barrier to calling for government formation under Article 76(2) as Dahal’s floor test was his fifth since taking office in December 2022 in the House elected that year.Article 76 (3) is automatically invoked when the prime minister appointed under Article 76 (2) fails the floor test in the first attempt. The last time he faced Parliament was on May 20 after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party, Nepal withdrew its support.The Maoist Centre is not happy with the President's decision. \"Yes, the President's call is not what we wanted. We believe it was a political move rather than legal,\" Hit Raj Pandey, the party's chief whip, told the Post. Asked if his party will challenge the move in court, Pandey said \"no\".However, the party’s office bearers said the Maoist Centre will not confront the President directly. Lawyers close to the party are most likely to file a writ petition in the court.\"There is every possibility that our legal wing will challenge the President’s move in the Supreme Court,\" he told the Post. Lawyers close to the party reiterate that Article 76 (3) is the only option for government formation after the prime minister loses the vote of confidence.Former attorney general Mukti Pradhan is one of those advocates close to the Maoist Centre who make such a claim. \nPresident Ramchandra Paudel will appoint KP Sharma Oli, CPN-UML chairman, as prime minister on Sunday after the Nepali Congress and UML submitted claims supported by 165 lawmakers, the minimum needed to form a government.\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a vote of confidence, prompting the formation of a new government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML, supported by the Nepali Congress, amidst accusations of conspiracies and criticism of the proposed constitutional amendments that threatened inclusive representation.\nDespite initial successes, Prime Minister Dahal's fifth vote of confidence attempt faces defeat as the largest coalition partner, UML, and several other parties withdrew support, leaving him with only 63 likely votes in a parliament where 138 are needed for a majority.\nKathmandu intensifies mosquito larvae destruction drive to curb dengue spread amid monsoon.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City's mental health screening training for doctors and paramedics aims to provide timely treatment for the numerous patients with mental health issues in the city, with plans to also offer free medication and address the stigma associated with these conditions.\nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nThe British Education Group, which owns The British College, Kathmandu, has now acquired the Maritime Business College (MBC), one of the oldest private institutes in Nova Scotia, Canada.Founded in 1899, MBC has a rich history of providing advanced career training. Over 125 years, the Halifax-based institution has built a strong reputation for educational excellence and adaptability in the evolving job market. The British Education Group said in a press statement that the local Ministry of Education also fully accredited the college as a Designated Learning Institution (DLI), making it one of the few private colleges in Canada authorised to recruit international students.They currently offer a diverse range of programmes, including Business Administration, Veterinary Assistance, Medical Device Reprocessing, Interior Decorating, and 2D-3D Animation and Digital Arts. As a result of this new partnership, the British Education Group plans to introduce additional courses offered at its London campus, Woolwich College. Rajen Kandel, Group CEO of the British Education Group, said, “We are committed to providing our students with global opportunities and experiences. This acquisition will facilitate seamless credit transfers between our Nepal, Dubai, and Canada campuses, further promoting our vision of creating global citizens.” The group owns several educational institutions in Nepal, Dubai, and London.  \nNepal recorded its historic high income from tourism in the first 11 months of the current fiscal year, which ended mid-June, according to the latest data issued by Nepal Rastra Bank. Industry insiders attribute this to the appreciation of the US dollar.The central bank said that the country earned Rs76.55 billion from tourism in the review period, surpassing the record set in 2018-19 when the country had earned Rs75.37 billion from 1.2 million foreign tourists. (At that time, the exchange rate was $1=Rs112.9.)According to a central bank report, Nepal received 1.06 million tourists in the first 11 months.“The surge in tourism income is primarily a result of the exchange rate,” said Deepak Raj Joshi, former CEO of Nepal Tourism Board. Any adjustments in the exchange rate will prompt an appreciation or depreciation of the tourist’s currency, affecting transport costs and the tourist’s decisions to visit the country. “Thus, the exchange rate impacts the number of tourist visits and tourism receipts,” said Joshi.“Besides, the growth of international chain hotels and Nepal gradually switching to a digital payment system has also contributed to the growth in tourism income.”The tourism ministry’s statistics show that the average stay of tourists in Nepal is currently 13.2 days, while they spend $41 per day.Gunakar Bhatta, spokesperson for the Nepal Rastra Bank, said the depreciated exchange rate positively relates to the tourism demand, as travel becomes less expensive when visiting a devalued country. “The currency factor, normally, forces tourists to select a destination before a trip. In this context, a country with a depreciation in domestic currency will attract international tourists,” said Bhatta. He said that while most of Nepal’s economic indicators have been underperforming, tourism has been doing exceptionally well.While Nepal’s economy is anticipated to grow by 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year, accommodation and food service, which are linked to tourism activities, are expected to see a robust growth of 21.84 percent, the highest among all 18 economic compositions in the Nepali economy.“This shows how the tourism industry has been a boon for Nepal’s sluggish economic growth.”The digital payment system has also been making tourism income transparent. Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer of Fonepay, said Indian tourists have been spending Rs5 million a day since Nepal started the payment system through the quick response (QR) code on March 1.“Since the central bank has fully opened the digital retail payment gateway for Nepali operators with any other country, it will help bring more foreign currencies.”Through the budget, the government has announced that it will draw 1.6 million foreign visitors this year.According to industry insiders, the target is attainable, but there are a few challenges.From November 8, Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport will be closed for 10 hours daily, from 10 pm to 8 am, for five months until March 31, to expand the taxiways.September-November is Nepal’s peak tourist season.Besides, industry insiders say the Nepal Tourism Board has been headless for the past four months, affecting all international promotional and marketing events.A number of reports, including the latest by the International Monetary Fund (IMF), said Nepal’s economic activity is expected to pick up, with growth reaching 4.9 percent in the next fiscal year 2024-25. This growth will be supported by an increase in tourist arrivals, boosting domestic demand. According to the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, in 2023, tourist arrivals crossed the million mark for the first time in four years.Foreign arrivals had crossed the one million mark for the first time in 2018 when the country received 1.17 million foreign visitors.The number reached 1.19 million in 2019. Then, the Covid pandemic started in early 2020, bringing arrivals to a standstill. Travel restrictions and an economic slowdown triggered by lockdowns delivered a massive blow to Nepal’s burgeoning tourism industry, decimating revenues and profits after 2020.Nepal received 230,085 and 150,962 tourists in 2020 and 2021, respectively. In 2022, the number shot up to 614,869.Joshi said that by the end of 2024, Nepal may get 1.2 million tourists in the year. “A careful execution of plan and proper marketing, especially in China, could boost arrivals to 1.6 million,” said Joshi. “It will be justified to shift Kathmandu’s airport expansion from November to December, to let the peak season pass.”Dozens of luxury hotels have opened across the country so there are no problems with accommodation, he said. Nepal has been widening roads and building other infrastructure, like airports, which will help attract more tourists. However, industry insiders say the government’s neglect of air safety problems could hinder future growth, particularly in the high-end segment, where travellers consider the safety of any destination country while making travel plans.Most embassies have put Nepal’s air safety situation on their travel advisories. The European Commission imposed this list in 2013 after Nepali airlines failed to meet international safety standards. The government has wilfully ignored the call of the United Nations aviation watchdog, the International Civil Aviation Organisation, to split Nepal’s civil aviation body into two entities: service provider and regulator. The separation is a crucial organisational reform agenda which has been a work in progress for the past one and a half decades. \nNepal’s central bank has allowed Nepali payment system operators to deal with digital retail payments in any country. For example, a Nepali payment system operator (PSO) can now agree with any PSO in any country to launch the quick response (QR) code payment system for the citizens of both countries to make purchases. Nepal Rastra Bank issued a circular on June 27, allowing a merchant-to-person payment (M2P) system. PSOs can now make agreements with PSOs of any country and start the service. However, before signing a memorandum of understanding, the PSOs need the central bank’s approval.“The central bank has fully opened the retail payment system. Nepali PSOs and PSOs of any country can now jointly start the retail payment service through QR code,” said Gunakar Bhatta, executive director of the Payment Systems Department at Nepal Rastra Bank.As the central bank has allowed merchant payment on the purchase of goods and services, the PSOs have started taking approval to start the service, Bhatta said. By coordinating on issues like bank settlement and dispute settlement, the licensed private sector PSOs can start the service.The central bank said that the withdrawal limit for a Nepali in a foreign country would be according to the existing foreign exchange rule, which is $2,500 per visit and $5,000 annually. There are 10 PSOs operating in the country as of mid-May.The QR code system in Nepal is relatively new.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay, a PSO, has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.With the central bank's provision, Fonepay has already started working, allowing Nepali nationals to make QR code payments in India.On June 1 last year, Fonepay signed a memorandum of understanding with Sri Lanka’s National Payment Network—LankaPay, to collaborate on a strategic partnership to revolutionise the digital payment landscape by developing an interoperable digital payment system that enables users to transact seamlessly across the two countries.However, in the lack of regulations, the QR code payment system did not start. “We have requested the approval for QR code payment service with Sri Lanka. We will soon start the facility,” said Paras Kunwar, chief operating officer (COO) of Fonepay. “Besides Sri Lanka, China is another market that we are looking at. We have started discussions with China UnionPay and Alipay+ to make cross-border QR code payments.”In May 2019, Nepal banned WeChat Pay and AliPay, stating that online payments through unregistered systems were illegal and resulted in a loss of income for Nepal. WeChat Pay, operating on Tencent’s messaging service, and e-commerce giant Alibaba’s Alipay are the two dominant platforms in mainland China.In June last year, Chinese digital payment service WeChat Pay and NMB Bank Nepal partnered to make the mobile payment system available in Nepal, allowing Chinese nationals visiting Nepal to pay for their purchases using their mobile sets.Kunwar said they would begin a QR code system in India from August. “For this, Nepali commercial banks are working on transaction limits and other issues.“We also need to adhere to many provisions including anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) before starting the cross-border payment services.”Kunwar said that the company is looking for other potential markets overseas where most Nepalis reside. For instance, South Korea is another prospective market for QR code payment.“We are looking into whether remittances can be sent through QR code if the central bank allows it. Nepal can be a potential market for tourists from South Korea and Japan and the service can allow them to withdraw money in Nepal.”Just like regional economic blocs, the payment service has also started making regional payment blocs. There is Asian Payment Network, a retail payment platform supported by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Kunwar said.“There are 17 members of the Asian Payment Network of ASEAN, including Sri Lanka from South Asia. Fonepay recently became a member of the Asian Payment Network, and with this, we can integrate the system with the 17 member countries.”The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.For instance, within three months of starting QR code payments to Indian citizens, Fonepay is handling around Rs5 million transactions daily. It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash. The Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.With the Fonepay service available in Muktinath and trekking areas connected to Pokhara, Indian tourists are increasingly withdrawing money while in these areas. According to a central bank report, QR code transactions sharply increased to Rs52.75 billion in mid-May from Rs45.67 billion in mid-April, after Nepal allowed Indian citizens to make payment via QR code in Nepal. The number of transactions also increased to 17.63 million from 16.10 million during the review period.QR code transactions increased to Rs53.88 billion from mid-May to mid-June, with a total of 19.82 million transactions. \nAmid an economic slowdown, the banking sector is looking for a slightly loose monetary policy to boost the confidence of the financial and private sectors, including individuals. The banking sector expects favourable working capital guidelines, which will open avenues for the financial industry and traders to increase their economic activities. In this context, the Post’s Krishana Prasain caught up with Upendra Prasad Poudel, chairman of Nabil Bank, to discuss the economy and the banking sector amid Nepal’s ballooning foreign exchange reserves and slowed lending. Excerpts:The monetary policy is due soon. What are the expectations of the banking industry?Our expectations from monetary policy are high as the country’s economy is going through a challenging situation. Some people say the economy is in crisis. But I don't call it a crisis because the external sector, including key economic indicators, is doing well. The country’s economy is looking for a boost—confidence where it will be easy for everyone to work in tandem. Our economic base is small. It will not take a long time for the economy to revive. In that background, we need a loose monetary policy to address everyone's needs.A loose monetary policy aims to stimulate economic activity and reduce unemployment by lowering interest rates and increasing the money supply. Without a loose monetary policy, building the private sector confidence is difficult. Liquidity is sufficient. To increase the credit demand, there is a need to boost consumption. To increase consumption, people need to have enough cash in their hands. That demands government and private sector investments. This depends on both fiscal and monetary policies. For instance, the construction sector is facing trouble, and as a result, there is not much economic activity with the government failing to pay the contractors. When contractors are not getting money, they are not giving it to workers. So the money is not reaching the people. As a result, consumption has remained stagnant. The government is not giving subsidies to agriculture or the insurance sector. We learn that the government needs more money. The private sector no longer trusts the government’s fiscal policy. In contrast, since the banking sector is regulated and disciplined, everyone looks up to monetary policy. Naturally, the private sector has high expectations from the central bank. What kind of policies are needed to revive the economy? As I said, public consumption needs to grow. To boost consumption, there is a need to increase credit. In the past, the banking sector made aggressive lending, but the credit did not go into the real economy or the productive sector. So, the central bank and commercial banks are now worried. Even though credit has seen a growth lately, the impact is not visible. At one level, the money needs to reach everyone's hands. So monetary policy needs to encourage credit flow. There is a slowdown in the banking industry, too. Banks are not able to offer dividends. Positive developments also exist. Interest has been cut, which will reduce capital costs, ultimately increasing output and consumption.Foreign exchange reserves are at a record high. Banks’ lending has yet to improve. What does this show?People are spending less. Reduced spending means that the demand for goods and services has declined. Even though the interest rate has declined, banks struggle to boost credit. As the foreign exchange rate increases, we have the space to increase imports. Banks have liquidity and the capacity to disburse funds. Interest rates are also declining, and the environment is becoming more conducive. But the demand for loans is a must. The confidence in the system must be high for the demand for loans to grow. The International Monetary Fund also indicates that Nepal’s situation may improve in the next fiscal year, depending on the monetary policy. What is sustainable banking? Why are Nepali banks reluctant to follow it?We look at sustainable banking in a futuristic way. We work for days beyond today. We work for tomorrow's generation. We work to make resources available for tomorrow. We must work to make everything sustainable. We have to preserve nature. Banks have gone for short-term profits. That's how we have deviated from sustainability. But our banks still need to go for sustainable practices. The central bank defines the productive sector including energy as the real economy. Investing in those sectors leads to sustainability.Our system ranks banks on the basis of profit, the number of depositors or the volume of loans. In reality, though, to be number one, the parameter should be the impact the bank has on the economy, environment, and society. Knowingly or unknowingly, everyone is talking about sustainable banking. Many banks have started reporting their carbon footprints. Many banks, including Nabil, have started various schemes for agriculture. There are products for women entrepreneurship for inclusive development and migrant workers as well. The banking sector needs to be aware of responsible investment. The central bank has been reinforcing this idea from time to time. How have cooperatives issues affected banks?As the financial system is interlinked, problems in the cooperative sector have impacted the banking sector directly or indirectly. Some cooperative deposits are with banks, and the bank's money has also gone to cooperatives. Not only cooperatives but some credit to loan sharks might have been sourced from banks, too. These are serious issues that need to be tackled prudently. We sense that the problem in the cooperatives sector will shake up the banking sector one day. The banking sector is highly regulated and has the capacity to absorb any shock, though it may not make a profit as before. Regulating cooperatives is difficult now: it’s already too late. The SME sector complains that getting bank loans isn’t easy. What can be done to increase credit flow?We are the custodians of depositors and cannot lend money to anyone easily. We draw a borderline to mitigate possible risk. Lack of financial literacy is still prevailing, and we have been working to create awareness. The financial sector has become transparent, but the private sector hasn’t. The government needs to create an environment that makes businesses transparent. The banks have started taking steps to develop and scale up entrepreneurship. Such initiative needs to be taken by the government, including the local level. The growth in entrepreneurship will stop our youths from going abroad. The government needs to spend heavily on developing entrepreneurship by supporting startups. Nepal has started cross-border digital payment. How has the banking sector started preparation, especially on the operating side?Banks have made a giant leap in terms of digital payment. Certain levels of credit are being approved online. Bank accounts are opened online, and security documents are automatically generated. We have moved ahead in the information and technology systems in the banking sector. However, we are still in the infancy when it comes to the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in the banking sector. To make transactions with India more comprehensive, we need support from Indian regulators, especially in preventing illegal transactions. With proper regulations and support, digital payments will boom. \nIn a bid to reduce patient deaths in hospital emergencies, the Ministry of Health and Population has started providing basic life support training to health workers.Officials hope that ongoing deaths in hospital emergencies would come down significantly once health workers were trained in basic life support.“Around 900 health workers, including medical doctors, nurses, paramedics, and health assistants, have already been trained with basic life support skills,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoky, spokesman for the ministry. “The remaining health workers will receive training in the new fiscal year.”Basic life support is a type of care that first responders, who could be health workers serving in hospital emergencies, provide to anyone suffering from cardiac arrest, respiratory distress and other life-threatening conditions.Experts say basic life support is very crucial in emergency situations—cardiac arrest, and trauma cases, among others. The procedure includes recognising and responding to emergency situations, seeking help, performing cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and providing breathing assistance.Chances of survival will be high if trained health workers respond to the cases first. Officials said that the number of patient deaths in emergencies could be reduced significantly if all health workers serving in hospital emergencies were trained with basic life support skills.“We will also encourage provincial governments to provide basic life support skills to health workers serving in provincial hospitals and health centres run by local units,” said Budhathoky. “Those serving in emergencies at private health facilities will also get this training.”Doctors say that basic life support skills can be effective in saving lives when provided promptly and correctly. Health officials say many health workers serving in emergencies of health facilities, especially those hired newly, do not have basic life support skills.Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body for medical doctors, said it is working to make continuous professional development training mandatory for licence renewal.“Doctors must pass a 100-mark test on ethics, basic life support, communication, infection control and the rational use of medicines,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, the council member. “Gone are the days when one would remain a doctor simply by obtaining a medical degree. They must be updated with skills and new knowledge.”A few years ago, the Council made professional development training mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will result in non-renewal of the medical licence.Medical doctors undergo the training regularly, and the council assesses its effectiveness every five years to ensure that doctors providing health care services are updated in their profession.Professional training involves processes that act as refresher courses to update and enhance a doctor’s knowledge, skills, and experience, even after the completion of their formal degree. It can take the form of fellowships, seminars, workshops, conferences, and continuous medical education.The NMC said that CPD (continuous professional development training) is a lifelong process of learning and updating professional skills.Doctors also need to take effective communication skills training so that they can communicate with the families and relatives of patients about their condition and the treatment process, including surgeries. In recent years, there have been reports of scuffles between hospitals/doctors and the kin of patients in the event of a patient’s death. At times, situations have taken a nasty turn in which doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised.The medical council said that implementation of the code of ethics has been a challenge thus far and that training such as the CPD could help in its effective enforcement. One of the problems the NMC is facing currently is its inability to prevent doctors and health institutions from advertising their skills and profession using mass media, which, according to the NMC, is against the code of ethics. \nIn a bid to support midwives and other healthcare personnel in ensuring safer births in low-resource settings, the Ministry of Health and Population has launched a “safe delivery app”.Officials hope that the mobile application will complement and enhance the ongoing capacity-building of health workers and help in reducing maternal and newborn deaths.“The Safe Delivery App provides up-to-date lifesaving procedures and practical guidance in the local language,” said Dr Bibek Kumar Lal, director of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services, at the launch of the Nepali version of the Safe Delivery App. “It aims to improve the quality of emergency obstetric and newborn care, and the main users will be our frontline health workers, especially nurses and midwives.”Officials at the division said that the government has collaborated with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the Maternity Foundation (MF) to launch the Nepali version of the widely used digital health tool.Globally, every two minutes, a woman dies. In Nepal, two women die every day due to pregnancy-related complications—most of which are preventable, said Won Young Hong, a UNFPA representative in Nepal. “These are staggering numbers. UNFPA is pleased to work with the concerned stakeholders to localise this digital application so healthcare workers across Nepal can use it.”The Safe Delivery App is an evidence-based learning and training tool designed to support midwives, nurses, and other healthcare professionals to assist during births and to manage the most common complications. Among other features, it contains the latest clinical guidelines, animated instruction videos, descriptions of practical procedures, and action cards. It is free, and once downloaded on a smartphone or a tablet, it works offline, making it possible to be used even in the most remote areas. To date, more than 435,000 healthcare professionals across more than 70 countries have been reached through the Safe Delivery App and the accompanying programme worldwide, with Nepal being the latest country to introduce the App. “We will work with provincial governments and development partners to quickly roll out the App throughout Nepal,” said Lal.Nepal cut the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Award. According to the National Statistics Office report, the country has further reduced the number of deaths to 151 per 100,000 births in 2021. Maternal health experts, however, say that even if the country has made good progress in reducing maternal deaths, the current maternal mortality ratio is more than double the Sustainable Development Goals target, which is 70 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births by 2030.Neonatal deaths have not declined between 2016 and 2022, according to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for the Sustainable Development Goals was to reduce neonatal mortality to 16 deaths per 1,000 live births by 2022 and 12 in every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The health ministry has been taking several measures to reduce maternal and neonatal deaths, including installing an underfloor heating system at birthing centres, setting up special newborn care units, training doctors, nurses, and paramedics in the district hospitals and distributing non-pneumatic anti-shock garments to prevent maternal deaths from excessive bleeding.Besides, the ministry provides free service and travel allowances for those opting for institutional delivery and antenatal visits. It also distributes misoprostol, a medication used to treat postpartum bleeding in new mothers, through female community health volunteers. \nAs heavy monsoon rains cause chaos across the country, dengue cases are surging in several districts, including Kathmandu.According to the Health Office Kathmandu, around 18 people are infected with the dengue virus every day. Officials, however, admit that this number could be just the tip of the iceberg, as the office gets reports only from 18 health facilities.“Yes, the number of people infected with the dengue virus could be several times higher than suggested by the reports we are getting every day,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu. “We are working to make daily reporting of dengue cases mandatory for private health facilities as well.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases with 159, followed by Jhapa with 120, Chitwan 83, Makawanpur 65, Tanahun and Doti 49 cases each, and Okhaldhunga and Sindhupalchowk 46 each.Sapkota informed that his office has sensitised the local bodies about the looming risk of a massive dengue outbreak in the coming days.“Mandatory reporting of dengue cases every day is among the preventive measures through which we can identify dengue hotspots,” said Sapkota. “This will help health workers target such measures in particular areas. Additionally, starting this week, we are resuming the “10 minutes at 10 am” initiative every Friday, during which mosquito breeding grounds will be destroyed.”Officials informed that several local units, including the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, have already started preventive measures against dengue. Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Doctors say many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections, including major outbreaks, have been reported from many districts. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks are reported every month, including in the winter months.According to health workers, storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, plastic material tossed in open spaces, and unused lands will be potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned the owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found there.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes. \nWith monsoon havoc sweeping across the country, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has urged health workers to avoid taking leave during the season.Officials have warned that health facilities could be overwhelmed by patients in the coming days as outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases are expected, as floodwaters have contaminated most of the drinking water sources.“We have requested the provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Health agencies have been cautioned about the looming risk of outbreaks of waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days.”Torrential rainfall started Friday wreaking havoc in various places across the country. At least 14 people have died in disaster-related incidents—nine in landslides and five in floods—since Friday, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Officials said 18 others have been injured, and four people are missing. Since the monsoon entered the country on June 10, at least 43 people have died in landslides and flood-related incidents. Lightning strikes killed as many as 19 people during this period.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases.The persistent rainfall that started on Friday not only destroyed houses and inundated settlements but also contaminated drinking water sources.Health officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snake bites—in the coming days.“We have also requested central hospitals and medical colleges to be prepared for help during disease outbreaks,” said Ghimire. “As we don’t have enough doctors and health workers to deploy to control the outbreaks, we have to seek help from big hospitals and medical colleges.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks. “Essential medicines have been stockpiled, health workers have been asked to be ready for deployment to affected areas, anti-snake venom has been supplied to health facilities,” said Dr Prakash Budhathoki, spokesperson at the Health Ministry. “As of Sunday evening, no outbreaks have been reported.”According to health experts, sources of drinking water generally become contaminated in disaster-hit areas, and people displaced by natural disasters become highly vulnerable to infections with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Every year, thousands of people get infected with vector-borne diseases such as dengue, kala-azar, malaria, and scrub typhus during this period. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,432 people from 73 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 159. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, snakebite incidents and resulting deaths are also common during the season, but the phenomenon, which experts dub “a lurking invisible crisis”, remains grossly neglected. “Incidents of snakebites have started to surge over the last few weeks,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, director at Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “Along with the surge in waterborne and vector-borne diseases in the coming days, we have anticipated a rise in snakebite cases.”Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nWith the onset of the rainy season, the incidents of snakebite are on the rise in western Tarai districts.Snakebite treatment centres and hospitals in Kanchanpur and Kailali districts of Sudurpaschim province are now crowded with snakebite patients. Treatment of the snakebite patients, according to health workers, is quite challenging as patients are often brought to the health facilities at the last minute.As many as 60 snakebite patients visited the Snakebite Treatment Centre set up by Nepal Army at Arjuni of Shuklaphanta National Park within the past three weeks. “Over the past one week three to four snakebite patients have been visiting the centre on a daily basis,” said Ratan Bohora, a paramedic at the Arjuni-based Snakebite Treatment Centre. The local residents have hugely benefited after the Nepali Army and the local community jointly established the snakebite treatment centre at Arjuni in 2014. The centre, however, has to refer the patients with serious health conditions to other well facilitated hospitals due to the lack of an intensive care unit (ICU) and ventilator. “Two patients who were bitten by poisonous snakes were referred to Mahakali Provincial Hospital in Mahendranagar this year. We have no alternative but to send serious cases of snakebite to other hospitals due to the lack of the ICU and ventilator facilities,” said Bohora. The centre also does not even have a monitor to track a patient's vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen levels. The flow of the patients is increasing, but the centre only has two paramedics to provide treatment.Incidents of snakebite and resulting deaths are common in Nepal, but the issue still remains grossly neglected as what experts call a lurking ‘invisible crisis’. Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report.Most snakebite incidents occur when farmers are transplanting paddy fields or children are playing outdoors. Health workers say that the snakes that live in water are generally less poisonous. “The cases that are most serious occurred at night, often inside houses. Such patients should be taken to hospital immediately,” said Bohora. According to him, people living in thatched-roof houses are especially vulnerable to snakebite, because snakes often enter such homes in search of rats.Nepal is home to around 17 highly venomous snakes. Each year, the country sees about 20,000 to 40,000 cases of snakebite. The numbers could be higher, as many cases of snakebite go unreported, health workers say.Another health challenge in rural Nepal is the superstitious belief in visiting shamans instead of seeking treatment at medical facilities for snakebite. Experts say awareness drives should be launched to educate people that the snakebite patients should be taken to the hospital at the earliest. They recommend promoting cleanliness around homes, preventing children from playing in bushy areas, avoiding nightime walks, and using torchlight while walking in the dark.“Treatment of snakebite patients is possible if they are taken to health facilities on time. Patients are often brought to the hospital only after their condition has worsened, resulting in serious consequences,” said Dr Arjun Bhatta, medical superintendent at Mahakali Provincial Hospital. According to him, 10 snakebite patients with serious health conditions visited the hospital in the past three weeks. “They returned home after treatment,” said Bhatta. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nSpain’s Mikel Oyarzabal scored four minutes from time as they capped a dominant Euro 2024 campaign with a deserved 2-1 win over England in Sunday’s showpiece for a record fourth title and condemned their opponents to a second straight final defeat.Oyarzabal finished off a swift counter-attack for the winner after England had fought back from a goal down for the fourth successive match and seemingly earned extra-time.“I have done my job,” said Oyarzabal, who came on for captain Alvaro Morata after 67 minutes. “Just the fact of being in the 26, you value it a lot. It happened to me but could have happened to anyone.”Spain manager Luis de la Fuente added: “I couldn’t be happier. A real team, European champions. I said I was proud and today I am even prouder. It confirms what we are. For me, they are the best in the world.”After a cautious first half where Spain had 65% possession but England’s Phil Foden managed the only shot on target, the Spaniards struck two minutes after the restart, despite losing influential midfielder Rodri to injury at the break.Teenager Lamine Yamal, who had been shackled completely in the first half, finally found space down the right and crossed for Nico Williams to slot home past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.Spain then enjoyed a purple patch with a series of sharp attacks as England’s previously watertight defence lost its shape and Dani Olmo, Morata and Williams all had good chances.England manager Gareth Southgate sent on Ollie Watkins, the scoring substitute hero of the semi-final, for an ineffective Harry Kane after an hour, with Cole Palmer, England’s most creative player in the last month, joining him 10 minutes later.PAY OFFThe changes paid off almost immediately when Jude Bellingham laid the ball back into Palmer’s path and the substitute curled home a precise low 20-metre shot in the 73rd minute.The massed ranks of England fans, who vastly outnumbered their rivals, exploded and the whole feel of the night changed.But Spain weathered the storm and a lapse of concentration saw England undone as Marc Cucurella was left in space on the left, received the ball from Oyarzabal and drilled it across the box for the substitute to stretch out a toe and poke it home.There was still time for more drama as Spain keeper Unai Simon parried a Declan Rice header from a corner and Dani Olmo then brilliantly headed away Marc Guehi’s follow up on the line.It meant that Spain added a fourth title to those won in 1964, 2008 and 2012 and, as only the third team in the last nine Euros to win the trophy without coming through a shootout at some point in the tournament following France (2000) and Greece (2004), nobody can deny they were worthy winners.For England the “30 years of hurt” after their 1966 World Cup success, which was the soundtrack to their hosting of Euro 96, will now run to at least double that number as they became the first team to lose successive Euro finals“We’ve competed until the very end of the final,” said Southgate, who is widely expected to step down having remarkably led his country to two Euro finals and World Cup semi and quarter-finals in his eight years in charge.“I think we didn’t keep possession of the ball quite well enough. They press you really well and you've got to get out of that pressure and we weren’t able to do that and in the end that meant they had more control of the game“The players have got to take enormous credit for getting us to the point they did. They way they fought and represented the shirt with pride. They were never beaten until the very end, the final five minutes of the last game and then that chance at the end. Just the character and resilience that they’ve shown.“It’s fine margins, but I think they (Spain) were the best team in the tournament and they deserved to win.” \nUruguay beat Canada on penalties in the Copa America third-place playoff match on Saturday after Luis Suarez scored a late equaliser in a 2-2 draw at the Bank of America Stadium in Charlotte, North Carolina.Rodrigo Bentancur also scored in regulation time for Uruguay, while Jonathan David and Ismael Kone scored for Canada, who finished fourth in their Copa America debut.Canada’s Ismael Kone had a tame spot-kick saved by goalkeeper Sergio Rochet and Canadian defender Alphonso Davies hit the crossbar as Uruguay won the shootout 4-3.Suarez and Bentancur also converted their penalty kicks in the shootout.“It was a hard blow, the previous match, but we knew we had to be mentally prepared because it was not the same to finish third than fourth,” Rochet told DSports.“We made a great effort against Canada but the wear and tear was noticeable. We tied it with a great goal by Suarez and we finished it off in penalties.”In the first half, Bentancur swivelled and smashed home a knock-down from a corner to give Uruguay the lead in the eighth minute, but Kone scored with an acrobatic scissor kick to level the scores 14 minutes later.Right after Canada’s goal, Uruguay had a break and Facundo Pellistri slotted his right-footed shot into the bottom corner, but Maximiliano Araujo was deemed to be offside in the build-up and the goal was disallowed.Canada went ahead in the 80th minute when Kone unleashed a long-range shot that Rochet parried, before Jonathan David pounced to slot home the rebound.Uruguay pressed for an equaliser and Canada goalkeeper Dayne St. Clair made a huge save on Suarez’s close-range left-foot effort seconds before the equaliser.Their pressure paid off when all-time leading goalscorer Suarez timed his run perfectly in the 92nd minute to get on the end of a Jose Maria Gimenez pass and score his 69th international goal to force a penalty shootout.“You can play a good game and end up losing it on penalties. Everyone who stepped up to take a penalty kicked it with confidence and where they thought it would go in,” Canada’s Davies told TSN.“Overall, I'm proud of my team. To come in this competition and compete with very good teams, it's an achievement that will live with us forever.”On Sunday, defending champions Argentina take on Colombia at the Hard Rock Stadium in Miami Gardens, Florida, to decide the continental title. \nUS President Joe Biden used the formal setting of the White House Oval Office on Sunday to ask Americans to lower the political temperature and remember they are neighbors after a would-be assassin wounded Republican rival Donald Trump.Trump’s shooting at a rally in Pennsylvania on Saturday “calls on all of us to take a step back,” Biden said. Thankfully Trump was not seriously injured, he said.“We can’t allow this violence to be normalized. The political rhetoric in this country has gotten very heated. It’s time to cool it down,” he said. “We all have a responsibility to do this.”“In America we resolve our differences at the ballot box. Now that’s how we do it. At the ballot box. Not with bullets,” Biden said in a speech that was about seven minutes long, and carried live by major news networks and the conservative channel Fox News.It was Biden’s third use of the formal setting of the Oval Office to comment on issues of major importance to Americans since he took power in 2021. This time, it is less than four months to go before the November 5 election, and Biden’s political future is in doubt.Biden’s appearance allowed him to demonstrate the power of incumbency, an important symbolic image as he battles some in his own Democratic Party who want the 81-year-old leader to step aside from seeking re-election out of concerns he lacks the mental acuity for another four-year term.Biden ran through some of the US’s multiple instances of political violence in recent years, including the January 6, 2021, assault on the US Capitol by Trump loyalists and the hammer-beating injury of Paul Pelosi, husband of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, in 2022.“Violence has never been the answer,” Biden said.Four US presidents have been assassinated and several escaped assassination attempts. Multiple presidential candidates have been shot, some fatally.White House officials hope the Trump shooting attempt might ease the pressure on Biden to step aside by prompting Democrats to rally around him.Biden garbled a few words and phrases in his address, a regular occurrence for the president, but one in the spotlight after his faltering June 27 debate performance. After he finished the address, Fox News Channel and other conservative news outlets highlighted his stumbles.Biden’s Oval address was a rare one. Last October he made a prime-time speech to comment on the Gaza and Ukraine conflicts and in June of 2023 he spoke when a deal was reached with Republicans to avoid a breach of the US debt ceiling.His campaign has called off verbal attacks on Trump to focus instead on the future. Within hours of Saturday's shooting, Biden’s campaign was pulling down television ads and suspending other political communications.“Tonight I’m asking every American to recommit,\" Biden said. “Hate must have no safe harbor.”But he said it is fair to contrast his vision with that of the former president, and that he planned to do so soon. Biden called off a trip to Texas on Monday for a civil rights address but will go to Las Vegas Tuesday for a speech. \nThe FBI identified 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania as the suspect in the attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump at a campaign rally.The suspect was shot and killed by the Secret Service seconds after he allegedly fired shots toward a stage where Trump was speaking on Saturday in Butler, Pennsylvania.The FBI said it was working to determine a motive for the attack. One rally attendee died and two other spectators were critically injured. Trump was shot in the ear.State voter records show that Crooks was a registered Republican. The upcoming Nov. 5 election in which Trump is challenging President Joe Biden would have been the first time Crooks had been old enough to vote in a presidential race.When Crooks was 17, he made a $15 donation to ActBlue, a political action committee that raises money for left-leaning and Democratic politicians, according to a 2021 Federal Election Commission filing. The donation was earmarked for the Progressive Turnout Project, a national group that rallies Democrats to vote. The groups did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.Crooks’ father, Matthew Crooks, 53, told CNN that he was trying to figure out what happened and would wait until he spoke to law enforcement before speaking about his son.In Bethel Park, about an hour away from where the shooting occurred, the streets surrounding the Crooks’s home were blocked off by law enforcement authorities.Mary and Stanley Priselac were standing on the porch of their nearby brick ranch-style home, trying to process the events of the last day and the spotlight now on their typically quiet residential neighborhood.“Nothing happens on the street, everybody kind of minds their own business,” said Stanley Priselac, 72. “Everybody is kind of shocked, surprised, some dismay.”“There’s never been a gun issue. There’s never been the police being called,” said Mary Priselac, 67. “You kind of have to wonder what didn’t he get in life? What led to this extreme?”Thomas Crooks graduated in 2022 from Bethel Park High School, according to a statement from the Bethel Park School District received by local ABC affiliate WJET-TV.“Our school district will cooperate fully with the active law enforcement investigation surrounding this case, and as such, we are limited in what we can publicly disclose,” the statement read.The school district did not immediately respond to an inquiry from Reuters.Crooks received a $500 “star award” from the National Math and Science Initiative, according to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review newspaper.A 2022 graduation ceremony video cited by the New York Times shows Crooks receiving his high school diploma to some applause. Video from that ceremony posted online shows Crooks with glasses in a black graduation gown and posing with a school official. Reuters could not immediately verify the authenticity of the video.Law enforcement officials said on Saturday that Crooks carried no identification to the site of the shooting and had to be identified using other methods.“We’re looking at photographs right now and we’re trying to run his DNA and get biometric confirmation,” Kevin Rojek, FBI special agent in charge, said during a press briefing.Reuters could not immediately identify social media accounts or other online postings by Crooks. Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, did not immediately respond to questions on whether the platforms had removed any accounts related to the suspect. \nEngland look to end almost six decades without a major trophy but must overcome the more fancied Spain in the European Championship final in Berlin which woke to sunny skies and an excited atmosphere ahead of kickoff.The Olympiastadion in the German capital hosts the clash at the conclusion of a drama-packed, month-long tournament that saw Spain stride seamlessly into the deciding game while England emerged from several narrow escapes into their first major final on foreign soil.They have not lifted silverware since the 1996 World Cup but feel their topsy-turvy route to Sunday’s final has built the necessary fortitude to see off the Spanish threat.“I think that the belief has grown as we’ve gone through the tournament, with what we’ve been through with the late goals and penalty shootouts … it builds resilience,” captain Harry Kane told reporters on the eve of the game.Both teams arrived in Berlin from their respective bases - England at Blankenhain near Leipzig and Spain at Donaueschingen in the Black Forest - on Saturday afternoon.They have a long day’s wait before kickoff at 9 p.m. local time (1900 GMT), spending it quietly in their respective hotels, broken up with a walk or kickabout and final tactical talk.Final wordsEngland manager Gareth Southgate is not planning a rousing speech. “We’ve got good experience of big matches now and I think at these moments you don’t need to say too much to the players, they don’t need motivating for a game like this - it’s about making sure the small details are right as fine margins decide these games and we’ve got to make sure we’re on the right side of them,” he said.Spain coach Luis de la Fuente has already revealed what he will be telling his players. “I always blush because I ask too much of them – but I’m not asking anything special tomorrow night,” he said when he spoke to the press on Saturday.“They will give it all, I see their faces, their spirit. I will tell them to enjoy something they have earned with hard work, dedication and concentration.”Spain, who have won three previous Euros, might be favourites but they will have to raise their play, the coach said. “We know that if we don’t play above the level we have shown so far, are not completely focused, we won’t be able to win,” De la Fuente added.Berlin was showing its best side in the run up to the game with warm temperatures and blue skies as fans in respective team colours milled around the city. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIndia must seek a broader regional engagement beyond bilateral immediacies in the Middle East. India’s diplomacy in the Middle East is again under pressure from conflicting parties of the Arab-Israeli crisis. India’s traditional policy of favouring a two-state solution with East Jerusalem as the capital of an independent and viable Palestinian state remains unchanged. Nevertheless, much has changed about how India reinterprets the meaning and the context of its Palestine policy.After the October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, Indian media and right-wing public opinion had overwhelmingly supported the Israeli military response in Gaza. New-Delhi-based Arab diplomats expressed their unease over the increasingly hostile public opinion towards Palestine.Beyond the balancing actThe ruling Bhartiya Janta Party’s pro-Israeli gestures are no secret to the Arab diplomats. They knew that a BJP-led government in New Delhi would start a new chapter of relations with Israel beyond the traditional “balancing act.” The BJP and its eco-system of support see Israel as a country that always stood with India in times of crises with Pakistan. Israel, aware of India-Pakistan disputes, fully used this as an opportunity and kept its normalisation efforts with Pakistan secret to avoid India’s sensitive public opinion. Those who are aware of Israel’s efforts to normalise ties with Pakistan understand that two Muslim nations, Pakistan and Indonesia, remain top priority for Israel and its Western backers who facilitated the Abraham Accords.Saudi Arabia, too, supports Pakistan-Israeli relations, as Pakistan remains its key traditional ally. In this context, the India-Israeli ties may not stay exclusive and may not be specifically Pakistan-centric in the long term. Israel, along with Pakistan and Turkey, was a key supporter of Azerbaijan’s recapture of Nagorno Karabakh in 2020, while Armenia relied on Indian military supplies. Since the Gaza-Israel conflict started, India has faced a different challenge.First, there is a strong pro-Israeli public opinion that is ingrained in the ideology of the ruling party and its supporters in India. Second, under Narendra Modi’s decade-long rule, India has decided to end the previous reluctance and isolation from regional affairs, reprioritising its relations with Gulf countries.How China fits inIn an ongoing competition for influence in the Gulf between the United States and China, India has joined the West-led efforts to support the Gulf countries’ security and stability. This is a bid to check the growing Chinese influence in the region. India is ready to offer strategic and security support to the region in the newly upgraded relations. The China-brokered Iran-Saudi normalisation has also helped India.For India, Iran’s real strategic value is not in the Gulf but in Central Asia and South Asia, where Iran supports India’s efforts in multiple connectivity projects. In this sense, India’s advancing relations with Israel have received little or muted objection from Iran. When news broke about India supplying arms and ammunition to Israel amid military conflict, neither Arab states nor Iran reacted. The supply of ammunition, yet to be confirmed officially, is a significant statement on India’s recalibration of Middle East relations.All official statements of India’s Ministry of External Affairs have underlined that Hamas’ actions on October 7, 2023, were acts of “terrorism,” a position taken by most of Western governments and silently supported by their Gulf allies, including Saudi Arabia and the UAE. India has previously welcomed the Abraham Accords, a Donald Trump-era initiative to re-engineer the resolution of the Arab-Israeli conflict outside the UN resolutions. Egypt, Jordan, Turkey, Qatar, and Iran have refused to jump on the bandwagon of the so-called new peace process.Crisis shapes the futureThe ammunition supplies to Israel may bring more support for India within Western capitals. However, the Arab-Israeli crisis continues to shape the future balance of power in the Middle East, mainly against the Western countries and their Gulf allies. Saudi Arabia has been more cautious and sensitive to the crisis because its domestic politics is more susceptible to widespread anger and unrest if it is perceived to be supporting Israel at the cost of a Palestinian state. Iran, with its regional ambitions, enjoys popular support in Lebanon, Yemen, and parts of Gulf societies. Whether the Arab states accept Iran’s role in the Arab-Israeli crisis or not, it remains an influential player whose support is crucial to maintaining any peace mechanisms. The brief military confrontation between Iran and Israel has alarmed the European powers about losing their say in the region if the US continues to disregard Palestinian demands.The biggest loserEgypt, on the other hand, is the biggest loser in the crisis despite having supported Israel for decades. Egypt is also wary of alternative routes being created by the India-Middle East Economic Corridor. The Israeli plans to carve out a new canal between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean via the occupied Gaza are not going well with Egypt. That is the reason why Egypt must protect Hamas despite its abhorrence of Hamas’ ideological patron, the Muslim Brotherhood.India is seeking opportunities for defence exports as the Modi government focuses on developing a robust defence industry. However, selling ammunition to Israel during a war showcases arms exports as a political statement. India’s quest for a regional strategy, however, has to be in compatible with the realities of the region where India is situated. Its geopolitics will, therefore, be tested less in the Atlantic and more in the Indian Ocean and the Gulf.Regional actors show little faith in American leadership and are searching for a new security architecture, which is less dependent on the US and Europe and willing to resolve regional crises.In the post-Gaza war period, regional powers like Egypt, Iran, Turkey and Saudi Arabia may actively seek the participation of Russia and China in the region. India must, therefore, be ready for a broader regional engagement beyond bilateral immediacies.-360info \nThere is a growing public outcry over rampant corruption in Nepal. People believe that corruption is widespread and institutionalised and involves political parties, senior government officials, local elected representatives, business communities and civil societies. New scandals seem to emerge constantly, with the government stepping up efforts in some cases but arresting only a few individuals involved, who are released soon after. Only junior officials or ordinary individuals are charged and made accountable, sparing the key masterminds and those with influence, party leaders, or senior government officials.Given the scale, magnitude and possible involvement of the highest level of political leadership and their patronage in the scandals, the public’s concern is that the institutions established to control corruption have become dysfunctional with the meddling of senior party or government officials or prominent business people. These institutions are primarily headed by individuals with patronage from the political party leadership, who protect the perpetrators manipulating the institution’s functioning. Furthermore, given that we have a united government with continued political negotiations taking place, there may be threats to pull down the government if certain give-and-takes are not met; thus, it is unlikely that any action will be taken against anyone involved. Deputy Prime Minister and senior political leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha recently stated that if the political party members are accused of corruption, the party leadership will complain and threaten the government to pull out their support. If any civil servants are arrested, the protest comes from civil service unions with threats of street-wise demonstrations. Similarly, if those controlling the economy are accused of wrongdoing, they accuse the government of taking steps to destroy the economy. He stated that all political parties, government and business people are wary of punishing their groups of wrongdoers. He questioned whether the government should punish only ordinary people, street vendors, small businessmen, labourers, or poor people if this is the case. He emphasised that it is impossible to have a clean government without real unity and united efforts by all parties to address corruption. Failure in sustainable developmentA massive increase in corruption continues to threaten the country's overall development, including jobs, infrastructure, health, human development, quality of life for every citizen and overall governance. Employment opportunities are less available in the absence of foreign investments and new industries. Lest we forget, some 75,000-80,000 people leave the country every month, seeking employment abroad. The quality of education in government schools has deteriorated significantly, with only 36 percent passing the latest SEE. Around 100,000 students went abroad for studies in 2023-24 and will most likely not return home. Nepal is bound to lose a new generation of skilled and educated workforce. Reputated public hospitals have become dysfunctional due to the non-availability of medicine, non-functional equipment and the absence of qualified medical professionals, who are often frustrated by a lack of prospects and seek employment abroad. Many private hospitals and educational institutions have been established but are beyond the reach of the vast majority.None of the major road projects have been completed on time in recent years. They often double the timeline, overshoot the budget and use substandard work, resulting in substantial economic loss and prolonged inconvenience and suffering to citizens due to bad road conditions, dust pollution and long travel times. Government offices providing basic services, such as the issuance of driving licenses and passports, are notorious for delayed services.Major scandalsSeveral major scandals that have been in the limelight in the country include gold smuggling, Bhutanese refugee scams, land properties surrounding the PM Office, the Ncell/Axiata sale case, OMNI-Covid-related purchases, the Giribandu Tea Estate case, Cooperative scandals and many more involving hundreds of millions of dollars. The main concern is that the real culprits are walking free, as they are part of the political leadership or individuals with solid party connections. As The Kathmandu Post put it in its recent editorial, “Rotten to the Roots”, indicating high local level corruption and “representatives have copied the ways of their federal leaders”. It is reported that out of 28,000 cases filed by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), half of the cases were at the local units in one year. Several such officials were recently reportedly suspended, and thus the local institutions cannot function, potentially threatening the whole process of devolution of power from the centre. Whether local units seriously lack good governance and fiscal transparency also needs to be verified and acted upon.Partnership against corruptionIt is gratifying that Nepal enjoys good friendship and cooperation with many countries, multilateral organisations and the UN, which have been keenly supporting Nepal’s sustainable development, peace processes and democratic transformation. Twenty-five years into the democratic process, there have been significant achievements and friends of Nepal should be proud of their partnerships and cooperation. Nepal is very fortunate that around 26 percent of the annual government budget is supported by development partners. Nepal is at a turning point, with its citizens increasingly concerned about intuitional corruption and the cartel system. In the absence of serious political commitments and weakness in government institutions, the situation risks further deterioration. This situation goes against the people’s aspirations for the overall sustainable development of Nepal, with a threat to security, stability and hard-earned democracy, devolution of power to the local level and failure to achieve the country’s graduation from LDC status. In 2014, major development partners and the UN joined together to remind the Nepali government of their concern regarding rising corruption. Leakage in aid leads to a trust deficit among donors, who continue to develop their strategies and find their way of delivering aid at the cost of the overall impact of development support. Nepal has ratified the 2011 UN Convention Against Corruption, so the government should take all measures to fight corruption. The current situation strongly requires development partners and multilateral institutions, including the UN, to continue to voice their concerns about the institutionalisation of corruption and closely engage with the government in supporting anti-corruption measures on multiple fronts. The outcomes of these efforts will have significant impacts, giving rise to greater values in development aid and across different sectors. Way forward Nepal should ensure that its citizens trust its intentions regarding good governance processes, and all known scandals must be transparently resolved. All governance institutions, such as the CIAA, should be reviewed to make them more effective and fully accountable. Every government public service should be improved through digitisation and targeted timelines, including, for example, the delivery of all pending driving licenses. The development partners must raise concerns about corruption and support the government in strengthening its accountability and transparency process with a robust digital system and other technical assistance. The government should occasionally provide exclusive briefings to the public, media and development partners on the measures it is taking to control corruption.  \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is all set to go today. After being taken for a ride turn-by-turn by a distant third CPN (Maoist Centre) led by Dahal, the two big parties in Parliament—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—have joined hands to form a coalition government. And with this, Dahal, who remained at or around the power centre for almost a decade even with his party performing poorly in polls, is pushed to the periphery—at least for a while. The overzealous commentaries about Dahal being thrown off the grid of power may, however, be premature. As per the current constitutional provisions, coalition culture is here to stay. And considering how adamant the political parties are in sticking to their morally corrupt politics, no one can tell if the impending Congress-UML coalition stays for the next three months or three years. As Dahal goes today, there does not seem to be much point assessing how well his coalition with the UML fared in just four months of its existence. It takes decades, even centuries, to build a nation. The five-year term of Parliament is the minimum required for a set of leaders to make some impactful decisions for the country. There certainly are provisions for changes in the government, even in the midst of the parliamentary term, but these should be exceptional cases. What we have got, however, is a perpetuity of the coalition culture. It is this perpetuity that has halted the nation-building process for decades now. With the same set of three old men playing the hot potato game around power, nation-building has become a staccato performance at best. Just as one performer comes to the stage and starts his performance, he is pushed to the sidelines in the middle of the act.Pushpa Kamal Dahal will perform the last scene of the four-month act that was his coalition. He will come on stage, search for UML chairperson KP Sharma Oli among the audience, and call him a betrayer. He will then look for the Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and blame him for being power-hungry. Oli and Deuba will then take the stage by turns and blame Dahal for trying to take them for fools. Such acts have been repeatedly performed, with the same set of plots, performances and actors. There is certainly a new actor on the block, a television presenter who thought he had had enough of shouting out of the small screen. He stepped out of the screen into the field and competed with the old guards whose noses he wanted to break—as his infamous saying went.The moment Rabi Lamichhane came to the spotlight after an impressive electoral showing, the masks he had worn all along started falling off. After a while, he became the fourth old man in the club of politicians who see fault in everyone else besides themselves. Only that Lamichhane was louder, more contemptuous of the media, and as directionless as the other three when it came to envisioning a future for the nation. As Dahal is forced to step down and Oli is about to take the helm, it is worth pondering if this sordid cycle of drama will end anytime soon.  \nIndian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has recently come under fire, both in India and abroad, for hugging Russian President Vladimir Putin even as Russia’s invasion of Ukraine shows no sign of ceasing. As expected, among the fiercest critics of the infamous hug is Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who called it a “huge disappointment and a devastating blow to peace efforts”. As Putin continues to be made a pariah by the Western world for his continued attack on Ukraine, India under Modi has made it clear that the world’s largest democracy cares more about the India-Russia military-industrial complex than international humanitarian concerns. Ordinary Indians do not seem to care about the intricacies of the Modi-Putin deal for arms trade. But they certainly do about the fact that Modi has convinced Putin to return the Indians who have been fighting Russia’s war against Ukraine. Like Nepalis, Indians, too, have been lured into joining the Russian Army. Like the Nepalis, Indian recruits have realised that the war is no walk in the park, that their agents sold them false dreams, and they now want to return home. Like the Nepalis, the Indians, too, have been killed in the senseless war, although in lesser numbers. According to Indian media, at least four Indians have been killed, while between 30 and 40 others are serving in the Russian Army. In contrast, a staggering 35 Nepalis have been killed in the war, while around 150 are still on the battlefield, waiting for the Nepali state to intervene and ensure their homecoming. Apart from returning those alive, Russia has also offered to expedite compensation to the families of the deceased Indian recruits. This is in sharp contrast to the fate of the deceased Nepalis, whose families have yet to receive any compensation. It has been months since the families of the fallen Nepalis started lobbying, demonstrating and organising sit-ins to put pressure on the government to take up the matter with its Russian counterpart. Government officials, including various foreign ministers, have claimed to be coordinating with Russian officials to repatriate the Nepali recruits. But the results are for all to see: Russia has turned a deaf ear to all such pleas.Notably, the recent agreement between Modi and Putin, which has yet to be made public, is the result of continuous homework by Indian government officials rather than just an outcome of Modi’s dinnertime charm offensive with Putin. The Indian Embassy in Moscow was consistently raising this issue. Likewise, Foreign minister S. Jaishankar was making a strong case for it in his meeting with the Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov on the sidelines of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation in Astana, Kazakhstan, last week. This shows how the Indian government has been using multiple channels to ensure the repatriation of its citizens. Having faced almost 10 times the number of Indian casualties, Nepal’s plight is comparatively more dire. Nepal must, therefore, double up its efforts by putting diplomatic pressure, even using Russia’s allies, including India, to expedite the return of the Nepalis. First, Nepal must again summon the Russian ambassador to Nepal, Aleksei Novikov, and make him answerable for Russia’s failure to repatriate Nepali citizens becoming collateral damages in its senseless war with Ukraine. Of course, we don’t expect Pushpa Kamal Dahal and his government to wield the kind of diplomatic clout of Modi and his country, the fifth largest economy in the world. What galls is that the Nepali state has been unable to harness even its limited diplomatic apparatus for such a noble and urgent cause.  \nAs much as we love the monsoon for its greenery and promise of a bountiful harvest, we dread floods, landslides and diseases. As in years past, disasters have wreaked havoc in several parts of Nepal this year too, leading to at least 70 deaths since June. Adding to the woes are vector- and water-borne diseases, such as viral fever, diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, typhoid, dengue and kala-azar, turning the season into a time of epidemics. The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has already warned doctors and the public of possible uptick in incidents of these diseases.In 2022, as a result of contaminated water, Kathmandu Valley saw an outbreak of cholera, with 77 positive cases reported. The same year, diarrheal diseases affected hundreds of people for many months. Just last month, a patient tested positive for the Vibrio cholerae 01 Ogawa serotype at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, of which the authorities were reportedly unaware, as per a Post report. This is not a good sign, as many cases usually go unreported because people don’t visit hospitals unless there’s an emergency, and a lack of investigation from the government means no awareness about the possible spread of cholera. Such negligence about a deadly disease will only fuel its spread.Moreover, the dengue outbreak in the country has gone out of hand over the years. According to official records, the virus has circulated to 73 districts, infecting almost 1,500 people since January. What is concerning is that these numbers could go up, as we aren’t even halfway through this monsoon, and the dengue virus lasts until post-monsoon. Additionally, climate change and rising temperatures have pushed the disease even into the winter season. Recently, health experts have also been worried about the possible instances of the Zika virus (similar to dengue) in Nepal, as cases are being detected in the southern neighbour India. The outbreaks of these diseases and their prolonged presence can easily drain the healthcare facilities of an under-resourced country like ours. In the monsoon crisis, the poor and vulnerable suffer the most, as their condition is compounded by contaminated water, floods, landslides, and other monsoon-related disasters. This not only affects their treatment-seeking behaviour but also their ability to adopt preventive measures, which could in turn lead to community-level transmission of diseases.The Epidemic and Outbreak Surveillance of the Ministry of Health is tasked with collecting data on diseases, informing the general public, and encouraging policymakers to take necessary actions against outbreaks and make people aware of them. Moreover, it also regularly monitors drinking water quality and does surveillance of water-borne diseases. In recent months, it has found harmful substances like faecal coliform in bottled water and even tap water in some places in the Kathmandu Valley. These findings suggest the surveillance and monitoring mechanism in the country has to be strengthened, and local units around the country should be made responsible for keeping their water resources safe throughout the year, especially during the monsoon, to prevent possible outbreaks of water-borne diseases. In the case of vector-borne dengue, Zika and chikungunya viruses, a year-round door-to-door search and destruction of mosquito breeding areas is a must.Nepal has been dealing with monsoon maladies for decades. Our healthcare system should proactively allocate human, infrastructural and budgetary resources to combat these monsoon epidemics and prevent unnecessary loss of life and a whole lot of suffering.  \nThe monsoon has been causing havoc right across Nepal in the past couple of days. At least 70 people have been killed in floods, landslides and other monsoon-related disasters since June 10, according to the Nepal Police. Five others were missing and 86 people were injured in water-induced disasters over a month. There must have been many other incidents not included in official records. The monsoon entered Nepal from its eastern part in the second week of June. Heavy rainfalls that caused huge damage in Bagmati, Gandaki and Lumbini provinces until Sunday, wreaked havoc in far-western Nepal on Monday.As a country with over 83 percent of its land covered by hills and mountains, Nepal is always at the risk of landslides and floods mainly in the monsoon period. Similarly, people in the southern belt are tormented by inundation. Monsoon-related disasters are a yearly occurrence. The Monsoon Preparedness and Response Plan 2024 estimated that over 412,000 households may be affected and of them over 83,000 are likely to be badly hit by monsoon-related disasters this season. In a decade between April 2014 to April 2024, there were 1,602 recorded floods and 2,840 landslides. At least 3,052 people were killed, 791 went missing and 4,176 were injured in the period, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority. Similarly, 16,054 buildings and other structures were damaged. This shows the magnitude of the losses caused by monsoon-related disasters in the country.As heavy rains have battered almost all parts of the country, a large number of people have been struggling to deal with the disasters. Besides deaths, missing and injuries, thousands have been displaced and taking shelter in nearby places. In such times, saving lives by rescuing people trapped in difficult situations should be the government’s first priority. Logically, what follows is shifting people from disaster-prone areas to safer places, swiftly distributing reliefs and working on a plan to rehabilitate the displaced. Though our three security agencies often do a commendable job of saving people’s lives, they are still not well-equipped. Just months ago, some of them died while trying to contain wildfires. Rescuers should be equipped with better gears and other logistics before they set out on rescue missions. Moreover, relief distribution and rehabilitation works often court controversy either because of substandard quality of the goods distributed, or the irregularities while carrying out the task.When it comes to rehabilitating flood victims, our state agencies have utterly failed. Thousands of people have been languishing in either nearby forest areas, on riverbanks or other unsafe places for years where they had supposedly been shifted for a few months. For instance, floods in Koshi in August 2008 displaced 7,563 families from the present-day Shreepur, Haripur, and West Kushaha, located across different wards of Koshi Rural Municipality. But they are still living in makeshift huts and mud houses as the government has failed to properly rehabilitate them in the past 16 years. The Koshi Flood Victims Struggle Committee is fighting for their basic rights. A state that cannot ensure the basic safety of its citizens, we are afraid, has gotten its priorities badly wrong.    \nThe Nepali Congress and CPN-UML forged an alliance to form a coalition government under KP Sharma Oli, potentially reviewing and amending the constitution to address political stability concerns, following Prime Minister Dahal's perceived instability and external interference.\nOver half of students failed Nepal's Secondary Education Exams due to teacher quality, outdated teaching methods, and inadequate implementation of the new letter grading system.\nNepalese Prime Minister's visit to India emphasized bilateral cooperation, energy trade, and the implementation of trade agreements with China while highlighting the need for improved diplomatic appointments and reciprocity.\nIn 28 districts, the National ID card will be required to access government services, despite criticism that the cards have not been widely distributed.\nCloudy weather and rainfall are expected across the country, with heavy rainfall warnings for Koshi, Gandaki, and Bagmati provinces.\nThe weather across the country is forecast to be partly to generally cloudy on Saturday.Light to moderate rain accompanied by thunder and lightning is expected in several regions, including Koshi Province, Karnali Province, Gandaki Province, Lumbini Province, and Bagmati Province.
