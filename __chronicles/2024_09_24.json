Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and India have agreed to reactivate bilateral mechanisms to resolve outstanding issues. This happened during a meeting between Prime Minister KP Oli and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in New York on Monday morning.Nepal and India have over a dozen mechanisms in order to look into various issues ranging from trade and transit, border and boundary, energy cooperation, cooperation in the field of water resources, inundation, security, connectivity, and infrastructure. “However, some issues that Nepal wanted to discuss with the Indian side did not come up categorically as this is a sideline meeting,” a Nepali diplomat in New York told the Post. More discussions will follow at different working level mechanisms, according to the diplomat. “At least we’ve resumed communications at the highest political level. This will be followed up, further discussions will take place in upcoming meetings and during Modi’s next visit to Nepal,” said the diplomat.The meeting lasted 45 minutes and focussed on strengthening bilateral relations, according to both the sides. This was the first meeting between Modi and Oli since they took office in June and July, respectively.“Had a fruitful meeting with the Prime Minister of India Shri @narendramodi ji on the sidelines of UNGA79. During the meeting, various matters of bilateral relations were discussed,” Oli wrote on social media platform X.“Had a very good meeting with Prime Minister KP Oli in New York. The India-Nepal friendship is very robust and we look forward to adding even more momentum to our ties. Our talks focused on issues such as energy, technology and trade,” Indian Prime Minister Modi wrote on X.Talking to the Post after the meeting between the two delegations, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana said that the two countries have agreed to activate the established bilateral mechanisms in order to resolve the outstanding issues. “During the meeting, we discussed the upcoming visit of the Indian prime minister to Nepal, as per our earlier invitation,” she said. “We are encouraged by Modiji’s interest in visiting Nepal, which would be a positive gesture,” she said. In the meeting, Oli said he wanted trouble-free relations with India and offered to work together to explore opportunities. Modi agreed and stressed the need for moving ahead with renewed zeal and commitment, according to another diplomat who is also in Oli’s delegation in New York. “Modi proposed resolving all outstanding issues through established mechanisms and our prime minister agreed,” the diplomat told the Post.While no specific date for Modi’s visit to Nepal was mentioned, officials from both sides have been instructed to prepare for the visit, possibly in November or December, according to the diplomat. “Former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited India twice in 2023 and 2024, so it is now India’s turn to reciprocate,” the Nepali diplomat said. “Modi seems enthusiastic about visiting Nepal.”Among Indian prime ministers, Modi has come to Nepal the most number of times. He has already visited Nepal five times. During her August visit to India, Foreign Minister Rana, speaking on behalf of prime minister Oli, had extended Modi an invitation to come visit Nepal.In a brief comment to the media, Prime Minister Oli said that he had a good meeting with Modi. A statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs after the meeting said the two leaders reviewed the unique and close bilateral relationship, and expressed satisfaction at the progress in diverse sectors including development partnership, hydropower, people-to-people ties, and connectivity—physical, digital and in the domain of energy.During the meeting, Modi congratulated Nepal on becoming the 101st country to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) as a full member, and underscored the importance of a regional response to climate challenges.​”Nepal is a priority partner of India under its Neighbourhood First Policy. This meeting continues the tradition of regular high-level exchanges between India and Nepal in furtherance of our Neighbourhood First policy,” said the Indian foreign ministry statement. Besides Modi, Oli also had several meetings with visiting heads of state and government. On the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Oli had a bilateral meeting with the Crown Prince of Kuwait, HH Sheikh Sabah Al- Khalid Al-sabah. “We discussed matters of common concern, from labour relations to promotion of trade, tourism and investment,” Oli wrote on X after the meeting. Oli also chaired the Summit of the Future Interactive Dialogue 1: “Transforming global governance and turbocharging the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development” on the margins of the general assembly. In his address, Oli urged all development partners to meet the target of 0.7 percent gross national income in overseas development assistance and 0.2 percent in the case of the least developed countries. He called for the implementation of the SDG Stimulus and combatting illicit financial flows.Closing the digital divide is urgent to ensure a digital future for all, he said, while underscoring the reform in the governance structures of international financial institutions to ensure they are more inclusive, transparent, and accountable. He also emphasised the urgency of comprehensive debt relief initiatives tailored to the unique circumstances of developing countries including LDCs like Nepal.“Climate adaptation and mitigation funds must be increased, loss and damage funds should be operationalized,” said the prime minister, saying that transforming global governance and accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is vital to leave no one behind. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nThe Kaski District Court has remanded former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Chhabilal Joshi into custody for five days for investigation. The District Police Office in Kaski obtained a court permission to investigate Joshi on charges of fraud and organised crime.Joshi, arrested in connection with the embezzlement of cooperative funds, was brought to Kaski on Sunday evening in connection with the misappropriation of savings from Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Saving and Cooperative Limited immediately after arresting him from Shankhamul in Kathmandu. He was produced before the court on Monday.The police sought permission to hold Joshi in custody to investigate allegations that he systematically defrauded the cooperative, citing violations of the Cooperative Act, 2017, and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 2007.After hearing arguments from the government side and Joshi’s legal practitioners, the single bench of Judge Chandrakant Sharma granted permission to the police to investigate him for organised crime and fraud.The parliamentary special panel, formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives, has recommended in its report that the government initiate legal action against Joshi, one of the founders of the Gorkha Media Network, along with the company’s chair GB Rai, then managing director Lamichhane, and board member Kumar Ramtel.Joshi, Lamichhane, Rai and Ramtel are accused of collecting millions of rupees from several cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, where they had allegedly embezzled the money.On Saturday, as recommended by the parliamentary probe panel, Minister of Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak directed the Nepal Police to take necessary action based on the probe panel’s recommendation. A member of the home minister’s secretariat confirmed this directive to the Post.The probe panel has recommended prosecuting the four, and the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) has issued a diffusion notice for Rai, who is on the run.Ramtel is already in judicial custody in Kaski for misusing cooperative funds. The police are now considering prosecuting Lamichhane.Sensing possible arrest, Lamichhane on Sunday requested his party members and supporters to stay alert and on standby saying that the government may do anything to him and his party.He made the request while addressing his supporters gathered at the party’s headquarters at Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening after unsubstantiated reports stated that the government was preparing to arrest him.“I don't trust this government. It can do anything. So I earnestly request you all to stay alert,” he said addressing the supporters.Parallel demonstrations staged in Pokhara for and against Rabi LamichhanePokhara, provincial headquarters of Gandaki, on Monday witnessed parallel protests—for and against Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of being involved in cooperative scams.The RSP activists and victims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative staged separate demonstrations in front of the district administration office of Kaski. The RSP cadres gathered at Sahidchowk with placards, warning the government to not detain Lamichhane on ‘any pretexts’. They said they were compelled to stage demonstrations as the government authorities were hatching conspiracies to detain Lamichhane on false charges and frame him.“It is our symbolic protest against the government’s plan to frame Rabi Lamichhane on false charges,” said Ekaraj Neupane, the RSP's Gandaki chairman. “We heard that Rabi Lamichhane would be arrested, so we staged demonstrations.” He said the party would also stage demonstrations on Tuesday if needed.On the other hand, victims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative took to the street demanding to detain Lamichhane stating that he is one of the accused in the cooperative fraud case. Speaking to reporters, the cooperative victims said that they were forced to stage demonstrations as the RSP activists pressured the government not to detain the suspect involved in cooperative fraud.The cooperative victims held their protest programme in front of the District Administration Office. The RSP activists gathered some 50 metres away in Sahidchowk chanted slogans in favour of Lamichhane. Anuradha Shrestha, a victim of Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative and ward committee member of the RSP, was in a dilemma about which side to join. She finally joined the cooperative victims and chanted slogans against the party's central chairman.Shrestha, aged 36, of Pokhara Metropolitan City-6 deposited her savings at Surya Darshan Cooperative. She had deposited a total of Rs1.6 million in the accounts of her, her husband and two sons.“I had even deposited the money that my sons received on their birthdays. I cannot forget my money deposited there,” she said. “If he [Lamichhane] is guilty, he should be punished. If he is not guilty, he should not be framed.”A good number of security personnel were deployed in the area to avert possible clashes between the rival groups. The parallel demonstrations were held within a distance of a few metres but there were no untoward incidents.Two weeks ago, the victims of the Surya Darshan Cooperative had waved black flags at Lamichhane who was in Pokhara to attend his party’s provincial meeting in Birauta.Hundreds of depositors from Surya Darshan Cooperative have been protesting for the past several months demanding return of their defrauded savings.On October 5 last year, police filed a fraud case at Kaski District Court against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of the Gorkha Media Network, and 18 other former and current directors and employees of the credit cooperatives, accusing them of embezzling over Rs1.1 billion.During the initial investigation, former home minister Lamichhane and Dipesh Pun, son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, were flagged as suspects. To advance the investigations, Kiran Bajracharya, then chief of the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police, deployed a team led by inspectors. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nNepal’s winless streak in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 continued to five matches as they suffered a five-wicket defeat against Canada in the second leg of Canada Tri-Series in King City on Monday.It was Nepal’s third straight loss in King City, after also losing their previous tri-series matches against Canada by 103 runs and Oman by one wicket at the Maple Leaf.The Rhinos’ winless streak in the second edition of the League 2 stretches back to February when they lost against Namibia (by two wickets on February 21) and the Netherlands (by eight wickets on February 25) in the inaugural tri-series, which was held at the TU Cricket Ground in Kathmandu.Their only victory of the second edition of the League 2 came against the Dutch (by nine wickets on February 17) in Kirtipur. Before that, Nepal had lost the League opener to Namibia by four wickets.The losing run now puts a big question mark on the coaching style of Monty Desai, who was thought to have finally addressed Nepali’s batting inconsistencies when he guided Nepal to 11 victories in 12 matches in the last edition’s League 2 that secured Nepal a third spot and a place in the Cricket World Cup Qualifiers last year.But the batting problems—which has been their biggest headache in both T20 and ODI formats—has come back to haunt Nepal again.Desai dropped Kushal Bhurtel, who is having the worst year of his life, again and started Arjun Saud in the opening line-up with Aasif Sheikh.Big-hitter Dipendra Singh Airee and Kushal Malla were also benched, giving opportunities to Anil Sah and Aarif Sheikh.However the new faces have failed to give Nepal momentum.The openers also failed to give Nepal a good start for a second game in a row, with Saud falling for 10 and Aasif departing for a cheap two.Rohit Paudel’s team again had to rely on lower order batters to post 181 in 46.1 overs after seeing their top and middle order collapse humiliatingly.Nepal were in big trouble at 36-5 after losing Bhim Sharki (4), captain Rohit Paudel (4) and Ani Sah (1) cheaply, with Kaleem Sana (3-29) striking twice.Aarif Sheikh played 10 off 33 and Gulsan Jha—who scored a half-century and took a five-wicket haul against Oman on Wednesday—made 34 off 56 to drag Nepal to 87-7 after 27.1 overs. After Sana dispatched Aarif and Harsh Thaker removed Jha, Sompal Kami and Sandeep Lamichhane put on a 55-run stand for the eighth wicket to help Nepal post a respectable total.Kami walked back in 38.4 overs after making 21 off 48, trapped leg in front by Saad Bin Zafar.Lamichhane was denied his first ODI half-century when Thaker had him caught by Praveen on 49 runs in the 45.4. It was his career best ODI score. Lamichhane hit five fours and one six in his brave 48-ball knock.Karan KC then added 24 runs off 28 balls.In reply, Canada lost their opener Aaron Johnson for a duck in the 4.2 overs, caught by Gulsan Jha off KC. But Johnson’s opening partner Navneet Dhaliwal and Pragat Singh shared a 122-run stand for the second wicket to lay the foundation for victory.Dhaliwal scored 87 runs off 133 balls smashing eight fours and four sixes, while Singh made 64 off 83 balls. Singh cracked seven boundaries and two maximums.Jha took the wicket of Singh in the 30.3 overs and Lalit Rajbanshi sent back Dhaliwal in the 37.4 overs but Canada were already closer to target.Thaker then played 24-ball 13 and skipper Nicholas Kirton added 11 not out facing eight deliveries to guide Canada to 186-5 in 42 overs.Lamichhane took two wickets, that of Thaker and Akhil Kumar.It was Canada’s third straight victory in the tri-series and seventh overall in the League 2 from 11 matches. The Canadians lead the eight-team standings with 14 points.Nepal next play Oman on Tuesday. Oman are in the sixth position with two wins and three losses from six matches. Their match against Scotland in July yielded no result.Nepal lie in the seventh position with just two points after seven games.The United Arab Emirates are at the bottom, also on two points, but have played only five matches. \nThe District Attorney’s Office in Chitwan filed a case against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai and 16 others at the Chitwan District Court on Tuesday for the alleged embezzlement of savings from Sahara Chitwan Multipurpose Cooperative. However, Chitwan Police have not arrested anyone to date.According to district attorney Shanti Prasad Luintel, the case was filed based on an investigation report following complaints from 446 depositors of Sahara Cooperative. The complainants claimed that the cooperative failed to return savings totaling Rs376,584,546. The investigation report further mentions that the cooperative has 6,334 depositors with total savings amounting to Rs523,285,308.The district attorney's office has directed the police to reopen an investigation into the now defunct Gorkha Media, as funds from Sahara Cooperative appear to have been transferred there. The police are expected to submit a supplementary report on the matter.Kumar Ramtel, one of the board members of the Gorkha Media Network arrested by Kaski Police on charges of misappropriating cooperative funds and subsequently remanded in custody, was brought to Chitwan for questioning. Of the remaining 16 accused, 11 are on the run, 3 are already imprisoned, and 3 are absentees, according to the case filed.The attorney's office has also instructed Chitwan Police to further investigate the transactions amounting to Rs470 million, which was deposited into Gorkha Media's account at Global IME Bank, as details on the nature and parties involved in these transactions have not yet been fully uncovered.Earlier, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak directed the police to implement the report prepared and submitted by the parliamentary special investigation committee formed to probe the cooperatives scam. Consequently, Nepal Police’s ex-DIG Chhabilal Joshi was arrested from Kathmandu and produced before Kaski court for the investigation of allegations on cooperative-related fraud and organised crime. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba has called upon the international community to assist in the safe release of Bipin Joshi, the Nepali student who has been in the Palestinian militant group Hamas captivity since October 7 last year.Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on Monday, Minister Rana drew attention to Joshi’s situation and urged global cooperation for his release.The foreign minister is in New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly.According to Minister Rana’s secretariat, she said that Nepal is eagerly awaiting Joshi’s return and appealed for international support.Joshi was abducted when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Ten Nepali students were killed in the armed attack.Minister Rana said the government condemned the attack and repeatedly called for Joshi’s safe release. She also stressed the need for collective global efforts to establish peace, pointing out that wars, rebellions, and violence persist in many parts of the world under various pretexts. “We are standing at one of the most critical junctures since World War II, with conflicts escalating worldwide. Prioritising the protection of civilians from armed conflict is more crucial than ever,” said Minister Rana.She further criticised the international community for failing to prevent ongoing conflicts and for not resolving the issues caused by wars, leaving citizens without peace and stability.“We are marking the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet the principles for civilian protection enshrined in the conventions are being ignored or misinterpreted. This must end, and we must all work towards peaceful coexistence,” said Minister Rana.The foreign minister expressed her deep concern over the civilian casualties in Gaza and the suffering of people due to the Russia-Ukraine war. She called for an immediate end to such violent acts and for peaceful resolutions to these conflicts, stressing that violence serves no justice. \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee of the Federal Parliament rejected the nomination of Ram Krishna Bhattarai, an ambassador nominee for Sri Lanka, by a two-thirds majority on Tuesday.Earlier, Bhattarai had requested to withdraw his nomination from the hearing process after failing to present the required educational certificate proving he had completed his undergraduate degree. Tuesday marked 45 days since Bhattarai's recommendation as ambassador, and the committee was required to decide on his nomination. It had endorsed 16 out of 17 ambassadorial nominees on September 19.Ishwari Devi Neupane, chair of the hearing committee, informed that Bhattarai’s nomination was rejected by a two-thirds majority.Bhattarai was unable to provide the necessary documents as required by the ambassadorial appointment guidelines, which stipulate that nominees must have at least an undergraduate degree from a recognised university.The decision of the committee, which met on Tuesday, reads: “As the proposed nominee himself has expressed his desire to withdraw from the nomination for the position of Ambassador, his name is hereby rejected by a two-thirds majority of the committee members.”Bhattarai had informed the committee that he was unable to produce the necessary documents verifying his educational qualifications.The committee also urged the government to adhere to the principles of proportional and inclusive representation in ambassadorial appointments. The committee's decision called on the government to ensure that nominations were made in accordance with Article 282(1) of the Constitution of Nepal and Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Parliamentary Hearing Procedure 2080, which emphasised the need for proportional and inclusive representation.Several members of the hearing committee had raised concerns over the lack of proportional and inclusive representation in the ambassadorial appointments and questioned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on why those principles had not been followed. The government faced criticism for not ensuring representation from marginalised communities such as Dalits, Madhesis, and Tharus when recommending 17 ambassadors.Additionally, the committee stressed the importance of considering candidates' qualifications when making ambassadorial appointments. The government was reminded to submit all necessary documents, including verified qualifications, along with the nomination for parliamentary hearings, as opposed to only submitting the nominee's name, as had been done in the past. \nAccording to a recent report published in this daily, at least 440 people have died by falling off cliffs in 10 districts of Karnali Province in the past 11 years. Salyan district topped the list with 117 deaths. Police said six people died in similar incidents in Karnali in the first two months of the current fiscal year 2024-25. A large number of other people were badly injured. Many of them lost their lives or limbs when they fell from cliffs and trees in the course of foraging for grass and firewood. People in this province, which is mostly covered in hills and mountains, often die while traversing risky roads and even while walking along treacherous paths carved into dizzying cliffs. It is a matter of shame for Nepal that a large number of its people are dying in the course of just going about their daily lives. This is not a problem specific to Karnali Province. People are killed in similar incidents across the country. Also, falls are taken as a serious problem around the globe, though the nature of incidents differ. It is the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, each year, an estimated 684,000 individuals die from falls globally—and over 80 percent of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. A study titled “Fall injuries in Nepal: A countrywide population-based survey” identifies falls as a ‘crucial public health concern’.When it comes to safety measures, Nepalis in general seem negligent and the degree of negligence is more concerning in remote regions like Karnali. This calls for a serious awareness drive in order to make people take precautions and prevent such incidents. There must be more robust safety arrangements in accident-prone areas, and the rules must be strictly enforced. Extra effort is needed when such campaigns are run in low-literacy areas. Youth literacy in the Karnali Province is 66.17 percent, even as the national rate is 85 percent; the population of those in absolute poverty in the province is 28.9 percent, even as the national ratio is 18.7 percent.The provincial and local governments themselves need to devise plans and programmes to address this problem as they understand the local complications, people’s necessities, and the kind of alternative arrangements needed. When it comes to deaths from falls, the priority should obviously be prevention. For that, the local authorities need to devise alternative paths to more treacherous routes, fence off certain places and quickly repair the essential roads. In some cases, they may even need to restrict people’s movements in particularly dangerous zones.As vital is to properly handle the injuries after the incidents and prevent the condition of the injured from getting worse. Right now, many places in Karnali lack even basic healthcare services. Some injuries get worse when people either don’t know how to handle the injured people or don’t have access to stretchers to carry them. Carrying severely injured people long distances for treatment is particularly difficult. Many deaths and injuries could be avoided if only the local health facilities were equipped a little better, both in terms of equipment and manpower.  \nThe total revenue collection of the government, including the amount to be transferred to provincial and local governments, in the fiscal year 2023-24 that ended on July 15 stood at Rs1058.90 billion. It was short of the Rs1422.54 billion target by Rs363.64 billion or 25.56 percent. The total government revenue in the previous fiscal year was Rs957.35 billion, against the target of Rs1403.14 billion, a whopping shortfall of 31.77 percent. The trend is equally pessimistic in the current fiscal year. The revenue target is Rs1419.3 billion. The average collection per day, which should be at least Rs3.88 billion to meet this target, is only Rs2.53 billion. As of September 22, or in 69 days of the fiscal year, the total collection is only Rs178 billion, which should have been around Rs269 billion. It is barely 12.58 percent of the annual target against the expected 19 percent to have been collected by now.A macro trend is apparent. For years, the government has shied away from setting a revenue target above Rs1400 billion. This revenue-GDP ratio has rapidly declined. In the last five years, the average annual revenue shortfall has remained at least 25 percent off target. This is a grave cause of concern mainly because there is no sign of substantial improvement in the collection. The traditional sources of revenue are shrinking, and the government appears completely clueless or impervious in exploring new revenue sources or expanding the existing tax base.Such a low revenue collection has made the country's public financial management challenging. The government is resorting to borrowing without hesitation. As of mid-September, Nepal’s public debt reached Rs2.52 trillion. The government borrowed Rs104 billion only in the past two months. The public debt-GDP ratio climbed to 44.34 percent from 28 percent a decade ago. Nepal's current GDP is Rs5.704 trillion.Tax reformThe proponents of state-led growth often seem to focus rather monolithically on distributive justice and expenses on every facility, such as health, education, infrastructure and social security, which the state should staff. They also argue that the rich should be taxed more to generate revenue for the same. Nevertheless, a mammoth caveat in this redistributive model is that it does not prescribe a recipe to expand the private sector growth, which produces more riches and enlarges the tax net.A key agenda in the ten-principle Washington Consensus, which the socialists of state-led growth schools view as 'the' theoretical weapon to globalise neoliberalism, is tax reform. The third principle of the 'theory' is categoric in stating: “Reforms should broaden the tax base and remove tax exemptions that exclude some politically connected taxpayers and organizations. Broadening and simplifying taxes can promote efficiency, improve tax collection, and reduce tax evasion.” Nepal's tax reform has comprehensively failed. A recent report prepared by a 'high-level committee' commissioned by the Ministry of Finance has pointed out that Nepal's tax-paying process and the tax system are complex. Tax compliance and tax risk management are suboptimal, and the implementation of key revenue-related laws—income, excise duty, customs and value-added tax (VAT)—is compromised by the weak and non-committed revenue administration. The practice of tax rate adjustment through annual fiscal bills has only added to policy instability and unpredictability. The tax exemption is ad hoc and massive, causing an estimated loss of about Rs200 billion annually. Lack of digitisation, automation and poor database management of the taxpayers have left loopholes for taxpayer-tax officer collusion and led to large tax evasion.This report states that the number of corporate taxpayers is only 261,815. However, the annual report (FY 2022-23) of the Inland Revenue Department data shows that the number of VAT-registered firms is 308,000, permanent account number (PAN) registration is 1.87 million, and registration on excise duty is 116,000. Individual PAN registration is 3.37 million. But regular taxpayers, including salary and wage earners, are estimated to be only about 2 million. This is indicative of a very narrow tax base.Tax justiceThe tax-to-GDP ratio in Nepal is about a quarter of its GDP, which is considered a high rate of tax imposition. But the fact is, the larger portion of the economy, in a rough estimate of about two-thirds of it, is a shadow economy or in no way accounted for in GDP calculation, which shows the ratio to be disproportionately high.Tax justice comprises two complementary ideas. First, the nation-state must adopt a progressive tax policy, meaning that those earning more should pay more. Also, the portion of direct tax earnings for the state should invariably be higher than the collection from indirect taxes. This is because indirect taxes like the sales tax service tax, VAT, excise duty and customs duty on goods are uniformly applicable to the poor and the rich. However, direct taxes like income tax, corporate tax, land revenue, capital gain tax and expenditure tax are levied only on those who earn. They constitute only about one-third of the total tax collection in Nepal. Similarly, the tax rates based on the income slab that ranges from 1 percent of income to 39 percent are considered stratified in many levels and too high for salary and wage earners, whereas the capital gain tax from the land and property transactions is not properly implemented. The concept of redistribution of wealth through appropriately designed tax policies, or redistributive justice, has also been blatantly compromised by the Nepali state. The state's objective should be to reduce inequalities in consumption, income and wealth among the population by redistributing the wealth and providing public services and social security to the marginalised and deprived sections. According to an OXFAM report, the income of the richest 10 percent of Nepalis is more than three times that of the poorest 40 percent of the population. The poorest 20 percent have only 4 percent of the wealth.Some policymakers recommend drastic measures like taxing based on wealth accumulation and imposing inheritance tax on ancestral properties. This is easier said than done. However, without substantially improving the revenue base, the state will soon be unable to finance regular/recurrent expenditures, let alone ensure redistributive justice. \nIndian politicians have argued for decades that the nation deserves to be a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). An aspirational superpower, India believes that it has been unfairly denied a seat at the high table.Several visiting foreign political dignitaries and international coalitions that have pushed for UNSC reforms have also voiced support for India’s candidacy for permanent membership of the Security Council. However, despite persistent lobbying by India, experts are not hopeful of change in the near future.There are four key challenges India must overcome before it secures veto power in the United Nations.China’s oppositionAmong the five permanent Security Council members all except China—the US, the UK, France, and Russia—have categorically supported India’s candidature in the past. As a close competitor of India in regional and international politics, China—the only Asian country with a security council seat—is unwilling to endorse New Delhi’s position. This adds to its power and international prestige, and China is unlikely to want to share this space with India. What’s more, particularly amid an ongoing border dispute with India, China will resist any attempt by any of the four members to change the composition of the UNSC.China is also uncomfortable with Japan, a close US ally that, like India, is a strong contender for a permanent seat. China has unofficially dropped hints that it may back India, provided New Delhi doesn’t endorse Japan’s bid. China knows that New Delhi will not break the unity of the G-4 (comprising Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, are four countries which support each other’s bids for permanent seats on the security council) and thus, considers it is a safe bet to pit India against Japan.Membership without veto powerSome parties have raised the prospect of India gaining UNSC membership without veto power. Groups including Uniting for Consensus (UfC)—a powerful coalition led by Italy, with other members including Canada, Mexico, Spain, Pakistan, South Korea and Turkey—have advocated reinforcing the working of the General Assembly and increasing the number of non-permanent members.Its argument is that the addition of non-permanent members will make the UN more accountable and representative by accommodating relevant regional voices in the decision-making process. In doing so, the group argues, this solution would mean there are more than a few select chief custodians of the international system.But there are questions about what happens if India gets a high seat without veto power. Could this be considered a piecemeal approach towards achieving the larger objective? Despite some parties saying they prefer this kind of arrangement, New Delhi is not comfortable with this proposition. India’s position is that all new permanent members to the Security Council must possess a veto. Thus, it is unlikely this outcome will unfold.Western concerns The US has, in principle, endorsed India gaining a permanent seat on the Security Council. But not everyone believes US policymakers will actually support such a reform in practice. Indeed, in the past, P-5 countries have displayed “a habit of being non-commital” when it comes to actual decision-making on veto powers. As former US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said in 2008: “We want to preserve the veto, and we do not want to extend a veto to new permanent members.”Prominent US-based South Asian expert Ashley Tellis recently penned a piece in Foreign Affairs magazine arguing that the US cannot be sure of India’s support on significant strategic matters. Ashley later defended this position in an interview, saying “the current war in Ukraine is a good example … India defines its interest in ways that are not always identical to our own”.It is true that India has not always voted with the West in the UN and has maintained an independent position on several critical subjects (e.g., India abstaining from the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Due to this, many think India is a fence-sitter and see it as an unreliable partner. The West, particularly after the Russian-Ukraine war, is more watchful of new geopolitical reality. The understanding that Russia may fail to secure any support in the world for its war has changed.Despite developing closer strategic ties with the West, India remained uncommitted on supporting sanctions on Russia. While China’s response was anticipated, for the West, foot dragging by New Delhi in criticising Russia was no less than a shock. In these changed circumstances, it is difficult to imagine that the West, particularly the US, will go ahead with a reformed security council where India has veto power.The regional conundrumIndia also faces formidable challenges to its leadership emanating from its own region. India influences the region, but not in absolute terms. Indeed, as instability in the region has increased, so too have New Delhi’s troubles. South Asia has become a battleground of India-China competition.And while the India-Pakistan rivalry captures most attention, there are major India-related issues that agitate people in Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and even in Bhutan.With its recent change of government, Bangladeshis no longer on the same page. Queries over India’s regional leadership raises questions over its claims to be a global power.Next steps for IndiaThere are convincing arguments that the UN is in desperate need of reform, particularly the Security Council. Expanding the Security Council’s membership to include developing countries like India would benefit the UN and the international community. However, New Delhi must make more concerted efforts to address criticisms to further legitimise its demand for permanent membership.India’s geographical, political, and social influence in South Asia cannot be ignored. Recent criticism around its increasing political intolerance—which is directly linked to the state of democracy in India—must be addressed and resolved.India’s failure to improve its ranking in the Human Development Index, the issue of economic inequality, and its lack of world-class infrastructure all contribute to the nation’s global image. Therefore, there are structural and more prominent geopolitical factors that overshadow India’s chances to acquire security council permanent membership.Additionally, India needs better engagement with the region and much more internal work to strengthen its claim further.-360info \nThe Covid-19 pandemic brought untold misery to Nepal. Over 12,000 people died from the virus. The national economy was decimated, and tourism came to a juddering halt. Yet even this darkest of clouds had a silver lining: The pandemic accelerated Nepal’s switch to a cashless economy. The four months of a hard lockdown in 2020, followed by many more months of limited mobility, forced even the otherwise digitally illiterate people to gradually take up online transactions, to pay for everything from daily vegetables to power bills. Digital payments shot up by 18 percent year-on-year in the final month of the fiscal year 2021-22, to hit Rs6.22 trillion. The corresponding figure for the previous fiscal was 5.26 trillion, which in turn was almost the double of the figure of Rs2.76 trillion in the fiscal 2019-20. There have of late been more indications of digitisation. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the number of cheques presented at banks dropped by 8.97 percent, from 16.72 million in 2021-22 to 15.22 million in the fiscal year 2022-23. In the same period, the number of transactions done through Quick Response (QR) codes doubled.This is something to be celebrated as a cashless economy has many benefits over a cash-based one. In a country where corruption has come to be synonymous with government service, digitisation can clean up governance and service-delivery. For instance, when people start paying online to renew driving licences or to clear land taxes, the role of the middlemen, who are responsible for most corruption in Nepal, will be reduced. There is also no question of such middlemen syphoning off the monthly stipends for the elderly and single women—something that routinely happened in the past—when such payments go directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. It is also harder to cheat on taxes online. More obviously, when you can pay your electricity and water bills from the confines of your home, the hassle of having to physically visit these offices and stand in long lines is removed. During the pandemic, looking to make themselves useful, even older folks started learning e-business from their more tech-savvy and younger family members. So the country has come a long way in e-transactions since the dark days of Covid. Things could be better though. The government, instead of helping with the process, often hinders e-commerce. For instance, online transactions are still taxed. The government says it will fully refund taxes on such transactions. Such refunds are rare. But why at all impose taxes that have to be refunded? Internet costs in Nepal are also high. According to the Connectivity in the Least Developed Countries Status Report 2021, Nepalis pay more for internet access than most other South Asians. In 2020, Nepalis had to spend 2.6 percent of their gross annual income to buy internet service, much more than what their counterparts in India, Sri Lanka or Pakistan forked out, where the corresponding cost was under 1 percent. It does not help that Nepali e-business laws are ambiguous and discouraging for online service providers. If only the most obvious and easiest roadblocks are cleared, the country will be on its way to a near full digitisation of its economy in the near future—to immeasurable benefit for the wellbeing of common Nepalis.   \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported on Monday that Nepal's economy is displaying early signs of recovery, emphasising the importance of addressing vulnerabilities within savings and credit cooperatives as a national priority.\"Incoming high-frequency data shows import growth is turning positive, tax collections are improving, and public investment is gaining momentum,\" stated an IMF staff team, led by Sarwat Jahan, following their visit to Kathmandu, which concluded on Sunday.The 12-day visit, which commenced on 11 September, focused on recent macroeconomic developments and the implementation of the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF)-supported programme.The IMF’s statement noted, \"Credit growth is recovering, while remaining appropriately below nominal GDP growth. Inflation has continued to decelerate, reaching around 3.6 percent by mid-July, partly due to favourable commodity prices and weak demand. International reserves are on the rise, supported by strong remittances, recovering tourism, and still subdued imports.\"The statement stressed the importance of accelerating reform efforts to place the economy on a path of sustainable, strong, and inclusive growth.\"This will require enhancing the execution of public investment, further strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation, and ensuring the prompt disbursement of Child Grants.\"The IMF also highlighted the need for continued vigilance as banks manage elevated non-performing loans and capital constraints, recommending further strengthening of regulations and the completion of loan portfolio reviews for the ten largest banks.Addressing vulnerabilities within savings and credit cooperatives remains a key priority. \"The recent amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Act are a positive step. Amendments to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, the completion of the NRB’s external audit, and increased transparency in public enterprises will enhance governance and accountability. Additionally, the Investment Facilitation Act will improve Nepal’s investment climate.\"The IMF commended the government’s ongoing efforts to meet key commitments under the Fund-supported programme, with the support of IMF technical assistance. \nChandra Bhandari scored a hat-trick as Tribhuvan Army Club defeated Waling Municipality 8-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Tuesday that guaranteed them at least second position in the ANFA Women’s League.Bimala BK and Amisha Karki scored a brace in their dominant display at Satdobato that gave Army 19 points from eight matches.Army have already qualified for the Super League and will now aim to dethrone defending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club from the top of the ten team standings when they take on already-eliminated Karnali Province in their final league match on Friday.APF have 22 points and can progress to the Super League as table toppers if they defeat or draw against Bagmati Youth Club in their last first round match, also scheduled for Friday.Bagmati beat Sankata 3-1 in the day’s other action to climb to sixth position that also boosted their hopes to reach the second round. However, they face a formidable challenge in their next fixture against a relentless APF.Nepal Police Club, who have two games in hand, have also qualified for the second round with 15 points.Despite the defeat, Waling occupy the fourth spot with 12 points and can ensure a top-five finish with a victory against Chandrapur on Thursday.Koshi are fifth with a game in hand and are the most favoured side to progress because they have an easy match-up against tournament’s weakest side Supurpaschim, who are still winless and sit at the bottom. For Sankata, Tuesday’s defeat against Bagmati is a big blow to their hopes of advancing to the next round. They must defeat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim to stand any chance of progressing.Army are one of the strongest and clinical sides in the league and on Tuesday, they showed their intent for their maiden women’s league title, handing Waling their biggest defeat of the season.Army went in front in the 38th minute when Waling goalkeeper Sanjina Majhi failed to make a routine save, allowing BK’s long-ranged strike to slip into the net.Bhandari doubled Army’s lead in the 43rd minute, sending a low shot past advancing Majhi after Karki set her up.Army went into the break 3-0 up, courtesy of an own goal from Fatumah Nakasumba, who put a corner from Hima Chaudhary into her own post.Bhandari furthered Army’s lead in the 54th minute following a well-coordinated team effort, which was followed by Karki’s two goals in the 62nd and 71st minute, both assisted by Dipa Shahi.Bhandari completed her hat-trick three minutes later, converting a pass from substitute Dikshya Gurung.BK then netted her second and Army’s eighth goal in the 90th with a stunning long-range effort.Sankata were looking to cap a dream season by reaching the second round in their league debut but Gifty Acheampong’s double and a late goal from Pushpa Kumari Khadka left them in the seventh position, three behind fifth-placed Koshi.Senegalese Acheampong gave Bagmati the lead in the 68th minute with a brilliant volley and furthered the lead in the 76th minute with a solo effort.Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute with a powerful shot after Mamata Pun put her through.Bagmati should have extended the lead to 3-0 when they were awarded a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time but their captain Divya Yasmali Magar missed it.But Khadka put the result beyond doubt in dying seconds tapping in a cross from Gifty. \nPolice arrested four individuals on the charge of providing false information to get citizenship from different areas of Kathmandu.According to Police Headquarters, the arrestees are Madan Bahadur Tamang,31 and Rameshwar Rijal,56, of Dhading, Chhiring Dhundup,53, of Tibet China and Chhiring Wangdi Sherpa,46, of Sindhupalchowk.While investigating the Nepali citizenship of Tibetan national Sonam, the police found that Wangdi Sherpa had facilitated getting it for Sonam under the name of Sonam Tamang by reportedly taking Rs 400,000 from him. They had procured citizenship from the district administration office in Dhading.Sonam was apprehended on charges relating to gambling. \nThe National Assembly’s Gender Equality and Family Committee approved a bill to strengthen punishment against deepfake sex crimes and victim support Monday, with the aim of passing it during a plenary session on Thursday.During Monday’s committee meeting, representatives of both the ruling and opposition party approved amendments to the Juvenile Protection Act and the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Protection Act.According to the amendments made to the Juvenile Protection Act, using sexually exploitative material to blackmail or coerce minors will be punishable by law.Current laws punish such crimes with imprisonment of one or more years in the case of blackmail and three or more years in the case of coercion. According to Monday’s amendment, these sentences are respectively raised to three or more years and five or more years when such crimes target minors.Additionally, the amendment also allows police officials to conduct urgent undercover investigations without needing prior approval from higher authorities when investigating digital sex crimes using deepfakes.The revision to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Protection Act specifies that it is the government’s responsibility to delete illegally filmed materials and to help victims proceed with their daily lives. To help with the victims’ recovery, the revision establishes a basis for both central and local governments to operate help centers for digital sex crime victims.The revised bills are expected to be discussed and voted on by the Legislation and Judiciary Committee sometime this week, aiming to pass during the plenary session scheduled on Thursday.Meanwhile, the head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency stated during a press briefing on Monday that the agency is investigating 74 deepfake crime suspects on charges of creating or distributing deepfake pornographic videos on Telegram.“Currently, 126 cases are under investigation and 74 suspects have been identified,” said Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency Commissioner Kim Bong-sik, saying the agency created a special task force late last month to crack down on deepfake porn crimes intensively.According to Kim, most of the suspects caught so far are teenagers, accounting for up to 51 people out of the 74 suspects. This was followed by those in their 20s with 21 people, and the remaining two in their 30s.-ANN \nNepal Television's Hem-Sunil Risky Television Journalism Award recognizes Kantipur journalists for reporting from Israel and NTV journalists reporting from Api Himal in 2024.\nShiva Adhikari, a Nepali in Germany, becomes the first Nepali member of the Integration Conference advising the Hessian government on integration policies.\nThe U.S. commits $500 million and 1 million mpox vaccine doses to African nations to combat the virus's spread, calling on other countries to assist in the global effort.\nTribhuvan University mandates exam cancellation for AI usage and grants supplementary exams to eligible students.\nPresident Zelensky urged decisive US action to end Russia's Ukraine invasion, stating Ukraine was close to the war's end after presenting a \"victory plan\" seeking NATO membership and Russian troop withdrawal.\nDriven by dissatisfaction with traditional workplaces and valuing flexibility, mental well-being, and career growth, young professionals in Nepal, like Gen Z and millennials, are increasingly embracing job-hopping in pursuit of fulfilling work environments.\nARIES (March 21-April 19) Take a moment to connect with and sort your emotions before starting the day, finding ways to self-soothe and move forward.

Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nThe 36th Asian Credit Supplementation Institution Confederation (ACSIC) conference concluded here on Monday, focusing on green finance and promoting SMEs, a critical trigger for meeting globally committed investments in achieving the SDGs.The 10th and final session participants discussed the 'Innovative Solutions: Financing for Nature’ theme.Green finance is a new financial pattern integrating environmental protection and economic profits.Babukaji Thapa, deputy general manager of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), emphasised how Nepal's banks and financial institutions promote green finance, mainly focusing on agriculture and forest-based enterprises.According to him, ADB has been implementing three major projects related to green financing: Forest for Prosperity, Psychometric Prosperity, and Value Chain for Inclusive Agricultural Growth. “These projects are being carried out in collaboration with various donor agencies,” he said.Agriculture in Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change. As a result, banks are hesitant to invest in forest-based and agriculture-related ventures. Thapa said that banks and financial institutions seek collateral to access loans, but many small farmers cannot provide it. “Besides, the lack of financial literacy among farmers makes it difficult for them to navigate the loan process.”“Nepal's forestry sector has a huge potential for economic growth. However, minimum investment and lack of favourable policy have hindered the realisation,” said Thapa.Nepal's Central Bank has imposed a mandatory requirement to finance the agriculture and energy sector. For example, commercial banks must provide at least 14 percent of their total credit to the agriculture sector by mid-July 2024 and 15 percent by mid-July 2025.They must provide at least 8 percent of their total credit to the energy sector by mid-July 2024 and 10 percent by mid-July 2025.Siddhant Pandey, CEO of Business Oxygen, IFC's SME Venture Fund, highlighted the innovative financial products currently implemented and practised in Nepal. He said that the growth in SMEs is transforming people's livelihoods in Nepal and has become a strong pillar in the national economy.He underscored the need for a paradigm shift in investment by implementing blended finance tools. Blended finance tools mix public and private funds to reduce risk and help attract more investment in high-risk projects.According to Pandey, blended finance is necessary because investors are more ready to take risks in such financing than investing in other tools.He also said that the provision of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) in Nepal needs to be properly implemented. “As a result, Nepal has been failing to attract investors.”He said Nepal should focus on green and resilient investment to achieve the SDGs and attain the zero carbon emission targets by 2045. He noted that renewable financing is complex in Nepal because investors are not assured of better returns. “Nepal needs some sort of policy intervention to promote green financing.”Natasha Kapil, Lead Private Sector Specialist at the World Bank, underscored the need to boost SMEs. In technology, Kapil highlighted the need to adopt energy-efficient technology. “The SMEs are playing an important role in the national ecosystem,” she Kapil, adding that modern technologies could increase their productivity.  \nHeifer International celebrated its 80th anniversary on Saturday in Nepal, marking its long-standing commitment as a nonprofit organisation dedicated to helping smallholder farmers end hunger and poverty in their communities.The milestone was commemorated in Kamalamai Municipality, Sindhuli, with the symbolic passing of 11 heifers from one farmer to another, embodying the organisation's “passing on the gift” philosophy.Heifer International has collaborated with the Nepal government on the Milky Way Project, which seeks to fully transform and modernise the nation’s dairy sector, thereby benefiting smallholder farmers and boosting the economy.In December 2022, Heifer facilitated the supply of 100 high-grade Holstein heifers and 8 Holstein bulls, donated by the government of Korea. The Milky Way Project aims to establish a “Model Dairy Village” in Kamalamai and expand its reach to benefit at least 500,000 families in the coming years.“The project exemplifies international cooperation and its potential to bring about meaningful societal change,” said Prakash Shrestha, the Bagmati provincial minister for agriculture and livestock development.“We are proud to be part of this initiative that is transforming the lives of our dairy farmers.” Heifer International CEO Surita Sandosham stated, “As we celebrate 80 years of Heifer International, we are reminded of the power of community and the profound impact of passing on the gift. This event in Kamalamai stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of generosity and the transformative power of our work.”Upendra Pokharel, mayor of Kamalamai Municipality, highlighted the project's success: “With the introduction of Korean cows, our monthly milk production has doubled from 27,000 litres last year to 55,000 litres this year.”Founded on 14 July 1944 by Dan West, Heifer International began with a shipment of 17 cattle from Alabama to Puerto Rico to help improve the lives of impoverished communities. The shipment of Korean Holsteins to Nepal in December 2022 and January 2023 continues this Heifer legacy.The “passing on the gift” ceremony is designed to promote a sense of community, solidarity, and shared purpose among farmers, fulfilling their responsibility as programme participants to help others improve their livelihoods, Heifer International explained.The Milky Way Project is already having significant positive effects on local communities, with increased milk production and improved economic conditions for participating families.Heifer International began its operations in Nepal in 1997, working alongside local farmers to enhance food security and reduce poverty by providing technical support to strengthen agricultural value chains, promoting environmentally friendly farming practices, and improving access to affordable inputs and services.Heifer Nepal has supported over 400,000 families and organised 277 agricultural cooperatives, all working under the Social Entrepreneur Women Alliance, an apex body led by progressive women farmers. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA few weeks ago a woman in her late 50s from Kathmandu visited a private hospital, seeking help for persistent abdominal pain and weakness. When doctors at the hospital could not diagnose her condition, she turned to another private hospital in Lalitpur.“Even there, doctors couldn't figure out her ailment in the general health checks,” said Kabin Maleku, executive director at Ask foundation, a non profit that provides free telemedicine services. “Doctors then carried out a blood test, which showed lead poisoning.”This has become a common refrain among hundreds of people across the country who have been affected by heavy metal poisoning from various sources, including from dietary foods, health supplements, and some ayurvedic medicines.Doctors attending the patient say that the actual cause of excessive lead levels in the blood of the woman is not known, though they suspect dietary supplements the woman has been using could be the main culprit.The acceptable limit for lead in the blood is 3.5 micrograms per deciliter(mcg/dl), but the woman’s levels had reached 65. Multiple doctors the Post talked to said that the number of people suffering from heavy metal has been rising of late. People often complain about severe abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhoea, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and numbness in hands and feet, according to them. Doctors say high lead levels can cause anaemia, weakness, and damage to kidneys and brain. Mercury exposure may cause lung damage, and harm the brain and kidneys, while long-term exposure to arsenic is linked to skin disorders and increased risk of skin, bladder, and lung cancer. Prolonged exposure to cadmium can lead to kidney disease and weakened bones.“I have come across a few cases of heavy metal poisoning,” said Dr Kunjang Sherpa, a cardiologist at Bir Hospital. “More can be said once I get their reports, but it is clear that heavy metal poisoning in our country has been rising alarmingly of late.”Experts say people using dietary supplements for weight loss and those using Ayurvedic medicine from online shopping to manage blood sugar and blood pressure have been found to suffer from heavy metal poisoning, including of lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium.Research has found that high levels of chemicals of heavy metals including lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others, have been found in certain dietary supplements and traditional health remedies.A study carried out by the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine under the Ministry of Health and Population in 2020 found toxic metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury in three medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic treatments for common ailments.The study was carried out in three districts—Manang, Dhading and Parsa.The Department of Drug Administration, the national drug regulatory body, said it has banned the sale of dietary supplements in pharmacies. “Neither we grant permission to import nor do we allow sales from pharmacies,” said Pramod KC, spokesperson of the department. “If any are found selling, our drug inspectors confiscate them and take legal action.”Drug inspectors from the department have found unregistered dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in tablets, capsules, and liquid forms, as well as beauty ointments containing pharmaceutical ingredients being sold in wholesale and retail pharmacies. Such unapproved products could cause more harm than benefits, officials say.KC concedes that even with the ban on dietary supplements in pharmacies, doctors have been prescribing and patients have been using them.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, which issues import licences, says that it thoroughly checks product licences issued by relevant regulatory bodies in the country of origin before granting licences.“Dietary supplements are not intended for curative purposes and should not be prescribed by doctors,” said Mohan Shrestha, spokesperson at the department. “Dietitians can recommend supplements. We also have tested suspicious supplements in our own laboratory and taken action against those that failed to meet standards, but we have not yet found heavy metal poisoning yet.”Doctors say heavy metal poisoning from dietary supplements and other products, especially those related to Ayurveda and cosmetics, is not a new issue, but what concerns them much is the lack of antidotes for all toxic heavy metals in Nepal. \nThe mpox outbreak in Africa is still not under control, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned on Thursday, adding that cases were still increasing in several countries.The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Countries in the continent are struggling to respond to another major outbreak coming at the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic that exposed weak health systems that were unprepared to deal with a major public health crisis.The number of mpox cases in Africa has surged 177%, and deaths have increased 38.5% compared with the same period a year ago, data from the Africa CDC showed.“We can say today that mpox is not under control in Africa. We still have this increase of cases that is worrying for all of us,” Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, told a weekly briefing on the outbreak.In one week 2,912 new cases were reported compared with the previous week including a new country, Morocco, where a case was reported, confirming the spread of the disease in all four regions of the continent.So far, 15 of the 55 member states of the African Union have reported cases, Africa CDC said.“We still have people dying from mpox in Africa. In one week, we lost 14 people,” Kaseya added.He added in some countries, such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two strains of the disease were in circulation, but because surveillance and testing systems were not robust enough, it was impossible to tell if that was the case in other countries.Kaseya said Rwanda had started its vaccination campaign, while the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak, is set to start vaccinations in early October. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club demolished Sudurpaschim Province 19-0 in the most lopsided win of the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex on Monday.Rashmi Kumari Ghising and Anita KC scored four goals each, while Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick for APF. Sabita Rana Magar and Kusum Khatiwada were at the double; and Anita Basnet, Saru Limbu and Renuka Hamal also found the net. APF’s one came from an own goal from Sudurpaschim’s Sumi Hangma Rai.The win also helped APF open up a six-point lead at the summit of the ten-team standings. APF have 22 points from eight matches. APF are also the team to score the highest number of goals in the league this season, with 46 goals to their name. They have conceded only two.APF’s 19-0 victory against Sudurpaschim is the biggest victory of the season so far. The previous biggest victory of the season was Army 14-0 success, also against Sudurpaschim.Winless Sudurpaschim have now conceded 65 goals in eight matches against their three goals scored (one each against Army, Waling and Bagmati Youth Club).They were also embarrassed 9-0 by Nepal Police Club, while their lowest margin loss came against Karnali Province when they suffered a 3-0 defeat.APF knew Sudurpaschim were the easiest target and took full advantage of it to go 11-0 up at half-time, with their three goals coming in the injury time. Their first-half goal rush also included an own goal from Rai in the 39th minute.Anita KC completed her hat-trick in the first half—her two goals came in the 45+2 and 45+3 minutes—and found her fourth goal in the 76th minute.Ghising, whose opening goal in the 8th minute opened the floodgates, accomplished a hat-trick two minutes into the second half and netted her fourth in the 76 minute. Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with 13 goals.Waling Municipality’s Uganda forward Jackline Nassali is second in the list with seven goals.Preeti Rai, who found her first goal in the fourth minute of the first half injury time scored two freekicks in the 64th and 67th minute in a carbon copy fashion.Anita Basnet, Sabita Rana Magar and Saru Limbu all got on the scoresheet before the break.Kusum Khatiwada, who replaced Saru Limbu in the second half , scored twice in the 82nd minute and 86th minute, while Renuka Hamal also got on the score sheet in the 90th minute.Earlier, Chandrapur Municipality and Koshi Province shared points after playing a 1-1 draw, also at the ANFA Complex.Sunita Sunar put Chandrapur ahead in the 51st minute but Mamata Raut equalised in the 80th minute to snatch a draw for Koshi.The draw moved Chandrapur up to seventh position with eight points. Koshi stayed in fifth position with 11 points. \nNepali boxer Ramit Maharjan has bagged two gold medals at the IFMA Youth World Championship 2024, held in Bangkok, Thailand, on September 11-20.Maharjan,15, of Thecho in Godawari Municipality, secured the medals in Muay Thai in the J12-15 men’s 39-41 kg category. In the final, he defeated Seyed Matin Hosseini of the Eastern Mediterranean on a walkover. On September 19, Ramit won the second gold medal in Muay Talay.According to his trainer and father, Ram Maharjan, Ramit competed in the matches on September 17 and 19.Maharjan qualified at IFMA Youth World Championship 2023 held in Kemer Antalya, Turkey last year but couldn’t attend due to financial difficulties.On his return, a grand welcome was organised with a victory rally where the residents of Thecho, relatives and students of Saraswati Secondary School celebrated the victory. Nawa Durga Dhime Khala and Misa Dhime Khala of Thecho honoured him with traditional Newari instruments.Maharjan has won numerous gold medals in different national and international Muay Thai competitions.  \nSamjhana Lawati scored a double as Nepal Police Club defeated Waling Municipality 2-0 to maintain their unbeaten run in the ANFA Women’s League at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Saturday.The victory also helped Police close the gap with second-placed Tribhuvan Army Club in the table to one point after seventh round. Police have 15 points from four victories and three draws.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club, the only other unbeaten team in the league, lead the standings with 19 points.Waling stays in fourth position with 12 points and are firmly in the contention to progress to the Super League stage. The top five teams at the end of the single round robin league advance to the second round.Waling started the season with a 4-0 loss against Koshi Province but their Ugandan trio Jackline Nassali, Cissy Nantongo and Viola Namuddu have dramatically revived their campaign, making them one of the top contenders for the top five race.However, they were wasteful on Saturday despite being the better side in the first half.Waling’s first clean chance came in the 3rd minute when Sushma Tamang’s tight-angled effort found Nassali for a free header after hitting the crossbar but the Ugandan headed straight into goalkeeper Usha Nath.Sajina Koirala had a scoring opportunity in the 10th minute when a corner from Nantango found her unmarked inside the just outside of the six yard box but Koirala could not capitalise on it.And Police punished them with two second half goals.Lawati broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. After Niru Thapa slipped a ball to Lawati, she brilliantly executed a dummy to outsmart Waling defender Maya Maskey before crashing the ball into the net.Lawati then added her second and the winning goal in the first minute of the stoppage time after Maskey failed to clear a cross from 90th minute substitute Nirmala Upadhyaya. Owoeye shines for SankataLeague debutants Sankata Club also boosted their chance to progress to the next stage after they thrashed Sudurpaschim Province 6-0 earlier on the day at the same venue.Nigerian Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye found the net four times for Sankata, while Mamata Pun and Purnima Hamal also got to the scoresheet.Owoeye put Sankata in front in the fourth minute heading in a cross from Manisha Thapa Magar and doubled the lead in the 12th minute taking advantage of a miscommunication between Sudurpaschim goalkeeper Tikesori Saud and defender Manisha Okheda.The Nigerian completed her hat-trick in the 53rd minute with a brilliant solo effort.Pun added Sankata’s fourth after Manisha Thapa Magar put her through.Hamal extended Sankata’s lead three minutes later after Punam Chemjong set her up inside the box.Owoeye then wrapped up a comfortable victory from penalty in the fifth minute of the stoppage time after Shanti BK badly challenged her inside the box.It was winless Sudurpaschim’s seventh straight loss in the league. They have now conceded 46 goals against their three scored and sit at the bottom of the table.The win moved Sankata up to sixth position with eight points. \nIsrael’s military said it launched airstrikes against Hezbollah sites in Lebanon on Monday, which Lebanese authorities said had killed 492 people and sent tens of thousands fleeing for safety in the country’s deadliest day in decades.After some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire since hostilities flared in October, Israel warned people in Lebanon to evacuate areas where it said the armed movement was storing weapons.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a short video statement addressed to the Lebanese people. “Israel’s war is not with you, it’s with Hezbollah. For too long Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,” he said.Families from south Lebanon loaded cars, vans and trucks with belongings and people, sometimes multiple generations in one vehicle. As bombs rained down, children crammed onto parents’ laps and suitcases were tied to car roofs.Highways north were gridlocked. “I grabbed all the important papers and we got out. Strikes all around us. It was terrifying,” said Abed Afou, who was with his family, including three sons aged 6 to 13 and several other relatives. They sat in traffic as it crawled north.They did not know where they would stay, he said, but just wanted to reach Beirut.Some people escaped on foot. People carrying small bundles of belongings trekked northward on the beach near the Lebanese town of Tyre.Nasser Yassin, the Lebanese minister coordinating the crisis response, told Reuters 89 temporary shelters in schools and other facilities had been activated, with capacity for more than 26,000 people as civilians fled “Israeli atrocities”.After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Iran-backed Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, also backed by Iran.Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah in Lebanon’s south, east and north, including “launchers, command posts and terrorist infrastructure.” The Israeli Air Force struck approximately 1,600 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, it said.Lebanon’s health ministry said at least 492 people had been killed, including 35 children, and 1,645 wounded. One Lebanese official said it was Lebanon’s highest daily death toll from violence since the 1975-1990 civil war.The fighting has raised fears that the US, Israel’s close ally, and Iran will be sucked into a wider war.Saudi Arabia expressed deep concern on Monday and urged all parties to exercise restraint, state news agency SPA reported.A senior US State Department official said the United States does not support a cross-border escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and that Washington was going to discuss “concrete ideas” with allies and partners to prevent the war from broadening.Israeli officials have said the recent uptick in airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon is designed to force the Iran-aligned group to agree to a diplomatic solution.The US official, briefing reporters in New York on condition of anonymity, pushed back on the Israeli position, saying the Biden administration was focused on “reducing tensions … and breaking the cycle of strike-counterstrike.”**CONFLICT ‘PEAK’**Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday marked a “significant peak” in the nearly year-long conflict.“On this day we have taken out of order tens of thousands of rockets and precise munition. What Hezbollah has built over a period of 20 years since the second Lebanon War is in fact being destroyed by the IDF,” he said in a statement, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.On Monday evening Israel launched a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs aimed at senior Hezbollah leader Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front. Hezbollah later said he was safe and had moved to a secure location.But Hamas’ armed wing said its field commander in southern Lebanon, Mahmoud al Nader, was killed in an Israeli air strike.Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli strikes had hit long-range cruise missiles, heavyweight rockets, short-range rockets and explosive drones.In response, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of missiles at a military base in northern Israel.Sirens warning of Hezbollah rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, including in the port city of Haifa, and in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the military said.About 60,000 people have been evacuated from northern Israel because of the cross-border fighting. Gallant said the campaign would continue until the residents had returned to their homes. Hezbollah for its part has vowed to fight until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.Hagari said Hezbollah put weaponry “inside Lebanese villages and civilian homes, and intended to fire them toward civilians in Israel while endangering the Lebanese civilian population.”Hezbollah has not commented on the assertion that it has hidden weapons in houses, which Reuters could not independently verify, but it has said it does not place military infrastructure near civilians.The strikes have redoubled the pressure on the group, which last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded.The operation was widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed nor denied responsibility.In New York, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Israel wanted to drag the Middle East into a full-blown war by provoking Iran to join the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. “It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,” he told journalists after his arrival in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, saying the consequences of such instability would be irreversible. \nRepublican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the US presidency if he loses the November 5 election, saying “that will be it” in an interview released on Sunday.Asked if he saw himself running again in four years if he is not successful in his third consecutive bid for the White House, the 78-year-old former president told Sharyl Attkisson’s “Full Measure” program: “No I don’t. I think that will be — that will be it. I don’t see that at all. Hopefully, we will be successful.”Trump faces a tight race against Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris, with polls showing the two neck-and-neck in key battleground states that are likely to be decisive in determining the winner, even as Harris has begun to edge up in nationwide polls.Trump launched his first reelection bid for the 2020 election on the same day he was inaugurated in 2017 and announced his latest White House bid two years ago in November 2022.Trump has continued to falsely blame his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden on widespread voter fraud and faces federal and state criminal charges over efforts to overturn the election results. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast his indictments as a political attack against him while embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric if he were to lose in 2024.He has also launched a number of business ventures amid his latest campaign, including Trump Media, NFTs, and Trump-branded sneakers, coins and crypto.Harris, 59, meanwhile, has cast the race as a critical moment for US democracy even as she seeks to focus on kitchen-table issues such as costs for families and housing.Asked whether the four-year break helped him regroup and figure out who he could trust as allies, Trump said: “It would have been easier if I did it ... contiguous.”“But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were,” he added.Trump, who spoke with Attkisson at his Florida resort, also said it was “too early” to make deals with people for any position in his White House cabinet should he win in November. \nIsraeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on Monday that airstrikes on houses in Lebanon in which “Hezbollah hid weapons” are imminent, as the defence minister said attacks on the armed group would deepen, calling on Israelis to show composure.Earlier, residents of southern Lebanon received calls from a Lebanese number ordering them to immediately distance themselves 1,000 metres (3,280 feet) from any post used by Hezbollah, a Reuters reporter in the south, who received the call, said.In a televised statement earlier, the Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a similar warning and said it was being “distributed in Arabic on all networks and platforms in Lebanon.”The Israeli military, meanwhile, launched its most widespread wave of airstrikes against Iran-backed Hezbollah in nearly a year of conflict, simultaneously targeting Lebanon’s south, eastern Bekaa Valley and the northern region near Syria.Asked by reporters about a possible Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon, Hagari said “We will do whatever is needed” in order to return evacuated residents of northern Israel to their homes safely, a war priority for the Israeli government.The latest attacks came amid some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire in a conflict raging alongside the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Hagari said that Hezbollah over the years has stashed weapons, including cruise missiles, in houses and buildings throughout southern Lebanon, and called on residents to stay away from these sites.Hagari presented in a media briefing an aerial video of what he described as Hezbollah operatives trying to launch cruise missiles from a civilian house in Lebanon and the subsequent Israeli strike moments before it was launched.“Hezbollah is endangering you. Endangering you and your families,” Hagari said. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe political rhetoric on Nepal’s development ambitions is high decibel. Yet, for decades since the first generation of economic reforms began in the early 90s, Nepal’s grand economic plans have been hobbled by the absence of humble but sustained actions—falling behind regional peers. The regulatory environment has failed to keep up with developments in both richer and emerging economies. The Maoist movement and protracted political instability eroded early progress. However, even after the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, the same issues continue to affect Nepal’s ability to attract and sustain varied sources of financing to meet its development needs—despite regularly organising numerous summits meant to attract foreign investments.In 2024 alone, Nepal held two high-powered summits to convene investors: The Investment Summit and the Infrastructure Summit. However, foreign investors’ attendance is dwindling in each successive edition of these summits. The reason is simple: There is no walking the talk, and existing foreign investors in the country continue to face significant hurdles in getting investment products approved despite the promise of seamless processing under the rhetoric of a ‘one-stop-shop.’ And their experience deters new investors.A rent-seeking mindset, coupled with bureaucratic illiberalism, is one of the biggest obstacles. In addition, given the largely left orientation, the country has an inherent anti-private sector mindset. From consumers and civil servants to journalists and civil society, everyone likes to take a dig at the profiteering private sector. The word ‘cartel’ is excessively used in describing the private sector. That bias extends among many politicians too—and manifests in different forms of constraints.Profit incentivises private individuals and firms to take risks and become first movers to cash in on the immense risk-to-reward potential. The private sector is the backbone of the Nepali economy, which contributes to over 80 percent of the GDP, according to the State of Private Sector Report 2023, a joint publication by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI). That is significant. Clearly, the private sector will continue to play a critical role in meeting Nepal’s development goals. To unlock its full potential, there needs to be a shift toward more consistent and transparent policies that foster investor confidence.Nepal is grappling with significant financing gaps across multiple key sectors. By 2030, the country will require an estimated $20 billion for energy development, $10 billion for infrastructure and additional billions for healthcare, education and tourism. The annual investment deficits are mounting and are quite substantial. Traditional funding sources, such as government allocations and foreign aid, are insufficient to meet these demands. To bridge this considerable gap, Nepal needs to explore alternative financial instruments like hybrid financing, private equity and venture capital, in addition to public-private partnerships (PPPs).Alternative financingWith over $100 million in investments, funds such as Dolma Impact Fund, Business Oxygen (Bo2), One to Watch, True North Associates, Global Equity Fund and Prabhu Capital have demonstrated the potential for alternative financing in Nepal. Dolma has invested in sectors ranging from renewable energy to healthcare and technology, raising significant capital from international investors. The fund has made several successful exits, including in the renewable energy sector, showcasing the viability of private investment in the country. Bo2 has also facilitated investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), highlighting how both domestic and foreign capital can achieve profitable exits in Nepal.In addition to traditional private equity and venture capital, the non-resident Nepali (NRN) community represents an untapped resource for alternative financing. NRNs are well-positioned to contribute to development not only through remittances but also by participating in innovative financial instruments like hybrid financing and bonds.Since their genesis in the United States in the 80s, hybrid or mezzanine financing instruments (HFI) have become widely prevalent in emerging markets. These instruments blend elements of both loans and equity. Investors and borrowers appreciate hybrid financing tools because they offer a range of options and adaptability. For example, a lender might provide a loan with a lower fixed interest rate and receive a share of the borrower’s profits. Regulatory constraintsWhile HFIs offer tremendous potential, Nepal’s regulatory framework has not yet been adapted to accommodate these innovative investment structures. HFIs are widely used in other emerging markets like India and Thailand, allowing investors to ‘hedge their risks’ while providing companies with more flexible financing options.Nepal has clear legal provisions for approving foreign investments in pure equity or straight debt form. Equity investments often involve ordinary or preference shares, while debt financing includes term loans and syndicated financing. However, there are currently no legal provisions for hybrid financing instruments that combine features of both equity and debt.A first-of-a-kind HFI commitment by an international financial institution to a local energy company to finance hydropower has been sitting at the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for nearly a year now. This situation highlights the need for a more dynamic regulatory environment that can accommodate the evolving needs of both investors and borrowers while easing requirements for exits for equity investors. Under Nepal’s Foreign Investment and Loan Management Bylaw 2078, all foreign loans require NRB approval, and there are caps on interest rates that can be charged. While these regulations aim to protect national interests, they often have the unintended consequence of discouraging foreign capital.Approval of this innovative financing structure would open doors for more investments by foreign investors into Nepali startups ready for scaling up, benefiting many companies in need of financing. To remain competitive in attracting foreign investment, Nepal must focus on making its regulatory environment more accommodating while building a bureaucratic structure that is fit for purpose. Nepal’s financing gap cannot be closed by rhetoric alone. Summits and political speeches can only go so far. Proactive policy reforms, along with clear and consistent implementation are essential to attract the capital needed for large-scale development projects. Legal reforms that enable faster and more flexible approval processes, especially for hybrid financing instruments, are crucial for Nepal to achieve its development goals by 2030. \nNearly two and a half decades ago, I observed a considerable annual number of patients with Japanese encephalitis at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). Many lost their lives due to complications resulting from the delay in hospital admission. The infections were primarily from the Tarai region, where outbreaks commonly occur during the monsoon. This year, too, there has been a significant resurgence of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal, with 14 patients reportedly succumbing to the illness since the start of the monsoon in June. Fatalities have already doubled the number observed in the last year, and the laboratory-confirmed cases are more than 60. It can be easily assumed that the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases could be in the thousands because Nepalis tend to avoid seeking medical attention until the disease presents severe symptoms. Therefore, the chances of determining the actual number of cases and geographical trends are slim.This scenario raises critical questions: Is Kathmandu at a high risk of the virus? Despite the inclusion of the vaccine in the childhood immunisation programme, are individuals who did not receive the vaccine or those who were jabbed many years ago (no booster dose received) in danger? Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne \"flavivirus\" from the same genus as the dengue virus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of Culex species mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, nearly one hundred thousand symptomatic cases are reported annually in Asia. Its mortality rate can reach up to 30 percent, making it a highly lethal infection. Even after treatment, up to 50 percent of those infected may experience long-term effects on the nervous system. Notably, children under 15 are particularly vulnerable to this virus. In most cases, the symptoms of the infected are either mild or not visible at all. One out of 250 infected individuals may experience severe symptoms, with complex issues in the nervous system. There is a strong seasonal pattern of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal, beginning in June-July, peaking in August and declining by October. This means that more cases are observed during the monsoon season. Thus, the ongoing outbreak in Nepal is expected to last for several weeks (at least more than four weeks), which means that deaths attributed to this virus could rise unless immediate and effective interventions, such as vaccine and awareness campaigns, are initiated. Symptoms begin to appear between four and 14 days after infection. These include high fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion/ambiguity, muscle stiffness/cramping, loss of consciousness, and, potentially, death in delayed treatment. No specific antiviral drugs are available for the virus. Treatment is based on the symptoms and complications. However, a vaccine against it has played a key role in curbing severe Japanese encephalitis that was once widespread. The sudden and unusual reemergence of Japanese encephalitis suggests that a special vaccination campaign should be launched in high-risk areas as early as possible. Unfortunately, we have been focusing only on counting the number of patients and waiting for the end of virus season. Similar conditions have also been observed with dengue virus.A study (conducted between 2007 and 2015) published in 2017 in the journal PLoS One, revealed that individuals over 25 are equally susceptible to infection and/or even have higher death rates than other age groups. Moreover, the study also showed a notable trend of Japanese encephalitis moving from the Tarai region to Hilly (including Kathmandu) and mountainous regions of Nepal. So, it is necessary to integrate all age groups in the immunisation programmes and extend them to the hilly and mountain regions. The essential consideration is assessing the likelihood of an outbreak akin to the one in the Tarai region occurring in Kathmandu, given the city’s high population density and limited awareness regarding the virus. Several studies have shown that a range of infections/vector-borne diseases, previously restricted to the Tarai region, are now reaching the hilly and mountainous regions. Dengue is a prominent example of how vector-borne disease can migrate from the Tarai to the hills. Moreover, a study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 2007 revealed that 75 percent of infected individuals had no history of travel outside Kathmandu, indicating that the Japanese encephalitis virus might have been circulating or even well-established in Kathmandu long before. The presence of Japanese encephalitis in Kathmandu is alarming and demands urgent consideration. The possibility of a \"surprise outbreak\" of this virus cannot be overlooked due to easy access to transportation, climate change, rapid urban growth/increased population density and the environment favouring mosquito breeding. We should not forget that dengue was once considered a disease that only appeared in Tarai, as it maintained its presence there for a prolonged time. Nonetheless, in 2022, 18 years since its identification, Kathmandu experienced an unprecedented and deadly outbreak that resulted in the deaths of at least 88 individuals within a short span.       \nAs the Nepali Congress chief whip in Parliament, Ramesh Lekhak was among the most vocal advocates for the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the irregularities in the cooperatives sector, with a particular focus on Gorkha Media Network. This was less than three months ago when the Congress was the main opposition. There had at the time been widespread media reporting on how the network chairman, GB Rai, and Managing Director, Rabi Lamichhane, had been involved in embezzling money from cooperatives and pumping it into the network’s Galaxy 4K television. The matter was urgent as Lamichhane was the serving deputy prime minister and home minister. Credible evidence had surfaced of the home minister trying to suppress police investigation into his personal involvement in the scam. Partly as a result of the relentless pressure from the likes of Lekhak and his party, such a committee indeed came into being on May 28. The same committee has now presented reams of evidence showing how Lamichhane misused money illegally brought into the network from various cooperatives. Lekhak, who has replaced Lamichhane as home minister, now has the chance to walk the talk and implement the recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee he so earnestly championed. Lamichhane and his Rastriya Swatantra Party colleagues rather curiously claim that the party chair has been given a ‘clean cheat’ by the probe committee. Far from it. It has instead held him responsible for the gross misuse of his office of the Gorkha Media Network’s Managing Director. Additionally, the committee has presented clear evidence of how Lamichhane used forged documents to undertake various financial deals while serving as the network’s MD. This is also an untenable premise considering that people in similar positions have been prosecuted. For instance, Gita Basnet, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, is on the run after the police filed a case against her. Basnet was held responsible for misusing the money of Nawalpur-based Chhipchhipe Cooperative, the money which had been invested in a resort she was operating. Interestingly, she was held responsible even though it was not her but her brother-in-law who had brought the money into the organisation. By comparison, the case against Lamichhane is more straightforward. Besides evidence of funds misuse, there is also paper evidence of millions of rupees being deposited into his personal bank account from the account of a cooperative. Legal experts say there is enough evidence to book Lamichhane for cooperative fraud under Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.This is not a question of exacting revenge against a political opponent, as some RSP leaders have tried to paint the case against Lamichhane. For Home Minister Lekhak and the administration, it is rather a matter of applying the law fairly. The government is already pursuing action against the other individuals who had been accused alongside Lamichhane in the same case. While a diffusion notice has been issued against GB Rai, others are in judicial custody. Lamichhane has thus far been let off the hook because of his political manoeuvrings. Now that the Cabinet has given Lekhakh the green signal to press ahead, he should diligently pursue the case to its end. How he pursues the culprits flagged by the parliamentary committee in the cooperatives scam, including Lamichhane, will define his success or failure as home minister.  \nNepal is marking the ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. While the government is preparing to celebrate with special functions, a few Madhesh-based parties want to mark it as a Black Day. The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party is one of the disgruntled groups that has announced a protest on the occasion. But the Janamat Party, a new force that is leading the provincial government in Madhesh, has decided to celebrate the day. A document of compromise, multiple forces, including the Madhesh-based parties, have grievances over the present constitution. The CPN (Maoist Centre) registered its dissenting views on various issues at the time of drafting the constitution, including on the form of government. They stood for a directly elected presidential system and agreed to a compromise deal with other parties. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which lobbies for a Hindu kingdom, was against the secular republican system. The pro-monarchy party has frequently launched agitations demanding the same. A fringe Rastriya Janamorcha party has stood against federalism right from the start. Various other parties and groups oppose one or the other constitutional provision. But they haven’t taken an extreme decision to mark the day of its promulgation as a black day.It’s universally accepted that no constitution is perfect and a statute cannot satisfy all sections of the society. It is hence said that a constitution is a living document that can be amended and updated based on people’s aspirations and the changed reality. Nepal’s constitution and political forces of the country have accepted these facts. The major political forces at the time of unveiling the constitution in 2015 promised the disgruntled groups that they would address some of their ‘genuine concerns’ through amendments. They have a moral responsibility to keep their word. After its promulgation, the statute has been amended multiple times. Going against the usual parliamentary practice of one of the two largest parties forming the government and the other leading the opposition bloc in the House, Nepal’s two largest forces—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are now together in government. The given rationale for their coming together is to amend the constitution and ensure political stability. Again, it is incumbent upon them to do so based on broadest possible consultations. Registering differences, pressing the establishment to get their demands addressed and peacefully fighting for the cause they believe is a democratic right of each and every Nepali. But the manner of the protest matters. The parties and the leaders that have joined governments and governed the country multiple times, both before and after the promulgation of the constitution, should present themselves in a more mature way. It smacks of hypocrisy when they say and do one thing when in the government and the complete opposite when out of power. More importantly, people should be convinced the agendas and demands of political forces are genuine. It is unfortunate that over the past decade, people have come to believe that the Madhesh-based parties are more than willing to trade their agenda for Cabinet seats. Their image has taken a nosedive, as is reflected in recent election results. The role of strong regional forces is important in the federal system we have adopted. However, the country’s regional parties are getting weaker due to divisions.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nNepal and India have agreed to reactivate bilateral mechanisms to resolve outstanding issues. This happened during a meeting between Prime Minister KP Oli and his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, in New York on Monday morning.Nepal and India have over a dozen mechanisms in order to look into various issues ranging from trade and transit, border and boundary, energy cooperation, cooperation in the field of water resources, inundation, security, connectivity, and infrastructure. “However, some issues that Nepal wanted to discuss with the Indian side did not come up categorically as this is a sideline meeting,” a Nepali diplomat in New York told the Post. More discussions will follow at different working level mechanisms, according to the diplomat. “At least we’ve resumed communications at the highest political level. This will be followed up, further discussions will take place in upcoming meetings and during Modi’s next visit to Nepal,” said the diplomat.The meeting lasted 45 minutes and focussed on strengthening bilateral relations, according to both the sides. This was the first meeting between Modi and Oli since they took office in June and July, respectively.“Had a fruitful meeting with the Prime Minister of India Shri @narendramodi ji on the sidelines of UNGA79. During the meeting, various matters of bilateral relations were discussed,” Oli wrote on social media platform X.“Had a very good meeting with Prime Minister KP Oli in New York. The India-Nepal friendship is very robust and we look forward to adding even more momentum to our ties. Our talks focused on issues such as energy, technology and trade,” Indian Prime Minister Modi wrote on X.Talking to the Post after the meeting between the two delegations, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana said that the two countries have agreed to activate the established bilateral mechanisms in order to resolve the outstanding issues. “During the meeting, we discussed the upcoming visit of the Indian prime minister to Nepal, as per our earlier invitation,” she said. “We are encouraged by Modiji’s interest in visiting Nepal, which would be a positive gesture,” she said. In the meeting, Oli said he wanted trouble-free relations with India and offered to work together to explore opportunities. Modi agreed and stressed the need for moving ahead with renewed zeal and commitment, according to another diplomat who is also in Oli’s delegation in New York. “Modi proposed resolving all outstanding issues through established mechanisms and our prime minister agreed,” the diplomat told the Post.While no specific date for Modi’s visit to Nepal was mentioned, officials from both sides have been instructed to prepare for the visit, possibly in November or December, according to the diplomat. “Former Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal visited India twice in 2023 and 2024, so it is now India’s turn to reciprocate,” the Nepali diplomat said. “Modi seems enthusiastic about visiting Nepal.”Among Indian prime ministers, Modi has come to Nepal the most number of times. He has already visited Nepal five times. During her August visit to India, Foreign Minister Rana, speaking on behalf of prime minister Oli, had extended Modi an invitation to come visit Nepal.In a brief comment to the media, Prime Minister Oli said that he had a good meeting with Modi. A statement issued by India’s Ministry of External Affairs after the meeting said the two leaders reviewed the unique and close bilateral relationship, and expressed satisfaction at the progress in diverse sectors including development partnership, hydropower, people-to-people ties, and connectivity—physical, digital and in the domain of energy.During the meeting, Modi congratulated Nepal on becoming the 101st country to join the International Solar Alliance (ISA) as a full member, and underscored the importance of a regional response to climate challenges.​”Nepal is a priority partner of India under its Neighbourhood First Policy. This meeting continues the tradition of regular high-level exchanges between India and Nepal in furtherance of our Neighbourhood First policy,” said the Indian foreign ministry statement. Besides Modi, Oli also had several meetings with visiting heads of state and government. On the sidelines of the UN general assembly, Oli had a bilateral meeting with the Crown Prince of Kuwait, HH Sheikh Sabah Al- Khalid Al-sabah. “We discussed matters of common concern, from labour relations to promotion of trade, tourism and investment,” Oli wrote on X after the meeting. Oli also chaired the Summit of the Future Interactive Dialogue 1: “Transforming global governance and turbocharging the implementation of the 2030 agenda for sustainable development” on the margins of the general assembly. In his address, Oli urged all development partners to meet the target of 0.7 percent gross national income in overseas development assistance and 0.2 percent in the case of the least developed countries. He called for the implementation of the SDG Stimulus and combatting illicit financial flows.Closing the digital divide is urgent to ensure a digital future for all, he said, while underscoring the reform in the governance structures of international financial institutions to ensure they are more inclusive, transparent, and accountable. He also emphasised the urgency of comprehensive debt relief initiatives tailored to the unique circumstances of developing countries including LDCs like Nepal.“Climate adaptation and mitigation funds must be increased, loss and damage funds should be operationalized,” said the prime minister, saying that transforming global governance and accelerating the implementation of the 2030 Agenda is vital to leave no one behind. \nAs the festive season approaches, prices of daily essentials like rice, edible oil, legumes, and lentils have increased.Retailers say food prices are expected to stay high throughout Dashain and Tihar, Nepal’s biggest festivals.In Nepal, food prices are heavily influenced by the Indian market. Even though prices have not increased in India, some opportunist traders have been taking advantage of the poor market monitoring to increase prices under different pretexts. For example, on September 14, India raised the basic import tax on crude and refined edible oils by 20 percent. Nepali importers seized this opportunity to hike their prices even though Nepal had not raised the import tax.Dhurba Prasad Adhikari, joint treasurer of the Nepal Retailers Association, said Nepali wholesalers and retailers have already raised the prices. “It has been a week since edible oil price was increased by Rs20 per litre and the price is expected to increase further as the festive demand kicks in,” he said. But he admits that market rumours and weak inspections make prices more unstable, especially during the festive season when demand is at its peak.According to the association, sunflower oil prices have increased from Rs190 to Rs210 per litre. Likewise, the per litre price of mustard oil has gone up from Rs350 to Rs370.Adhikari, who operates Adhikari Khadya Store, said the price of edible oil is expected to increase in Tihar due to high demand.Retailers said strict inspections in large trading houses could help stabilise prices during the festive season. Consumer rights activists say the current government inspections of the market are just for show and will not address issues related to price, quality, and quantity.“The government’s market inspection body is looking only at retail markets. They, too, know this will not change prices unless they also inspect the warehouses of large importers and traders,” Adhikari said. He said that the government inspecting body needs to check on the stock of goods held by traders.According to retailers, even with the new rice harvesting beginning soon, prices of the staple have increased by Rs100 kg for a 25 kg bag.Even the price of sona mansuli, which normally remains at Rs60 per kg, has now inched up to Rs70 to Rs75 per kg.Rice prices, however, are expected to decline after the arrival of the new harvest.Sugar is now being sold at Rs120 per kg and expected to rise further, retailers said.As private sector traders say they are out of sugar stock and both state supply utilities—the Salt Trading Corporation and the Food Management and Trading Company—have delayed opening the tender to import the sweetener, according to market insiders, the price is expected to cross Rs160 per kg by Tihar.However, retailers said the jeera (cumin seed) price has declined. But the price could still go up in the next two weeks.Last year during Dashain, the price of jeera, an indispensable spice, spiked from Rs1,400 to Rs1,500 per kg. The price has declined, and it is being transacted around Rs950 per kg this year, Adhikari said. Prices of lentils and legumes tend to fluctuate based on international production, but have remained high in recent months.According to the association, pulses have reached Rs180 per kg from Rs175 per kg.Adhikari said food prices have been increasing every year. “The rice prices are so high that people are buying only what they need in smaller quantities,” said Adhikari.“The government needs to intervene in the market, particularly inspect the large traders engaged in unscrupulous market activities,” said Prem Lal Maharjan, president of the National Consumer Forum. “Proper inspection will help bring the prices down. It will also help the government bring in more revenues,” he said.As the government has started operating fair-price shops across the country, there might be some relief for consumers, Maharjan said. “But such subsidised shops should be operated year-round to control market prices.”    \nThe Kaski District Court has remanded former Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Chhabilal Joshi into custody for five days for investigation. The District Police Office in Kaski obtained a court permission to investigate Joshi on charges of fraud and organised crime.Joshi, arrested in connection with the embezzlement of cooperative funds, was brought to Kaski on Sunday evening in connection with the misappropriation of savings from Pokhara-based Suryadarshan Saving and Cooperative Limited immediately after arresting him from Shankhamul in Kathmandu. He was produced before the court on Monday.The police sought permission to hold Joshi in custody to investigate allegations that he systematically defrauded the cooperative, citing violations of the Cooperative Act, 2017, and the Prevention of Organised Crime Act, 2007.After hearing arguments from the government side and Joshi’s legal practitioners, the single bench of Judge Chandrakant Sharma granted permission to the police to investigate him for organised crime and fraud.The parliamentary special panel, formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives, has recommended in its report that the government initiate legal action against Joshi, one of the founders of the Gorkha Media Network, along with the company’s chair GB Rai, then managing director Lamichhane, and board member Kumar Ramtel.Joshi, Lamichhane, Rai and Ramtel are accused of collecting millions of rupees from several cooperatives to run the Gorkha Media Network, where they had allegedly embezzled the money.On Saturday, as recommended by the parliamentary probe panel, Minister of Home Affairs Ramesh Lekhak directed the Nepal Police to take necessary action based on the probe panel’s recommendation. A member of the home minister’s secretariat confirmed this directive to the Post.The probe panel has recommended prosecuting the four, and the International Criminal Police Organisation (INTERPOL) has issued a diffusion notice for Rai, who is on the run.Ramtel is already in judicial custody in Kaski for misusing cooperative funds. The police are now considering prosecuting Lamichhane.Sensing possible arrest, Lamichhane on Sunday requested his party members and supporters to stay alert and on standby saying that the government may do anything to him and his party.He made the request while addressing his supporters gathered at the party’s headquarters at Balaju, Kathmandu on Sunday evening after unsubstantiated reports stated that the government was preparing to arrest him.“I don't trust this government. It can do anything. So I earnestly request you all to stay alert,” he said addressing the supporters.Parallel demonstrations staged in Pokhara for and against Rabi LamichhanePokhara, provincial headquarters of Gandaki, on Monday witnessed parallel protests—for and against Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) Chairman Rabi Lamichhane, who is accused of being involved in cooperative scams.The RSP activists and victims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative staged separate demonstrations in front of the district administration office of Kaski. The RSP cadres gathered at Sahidchowk with placards, warning the government to not detain Lamichhane on ‘any pretexts’. They said they were compelled to stage demonstrations as the government authorities were hatching conspiracies to detain Lamichhane on false charges and frame him.“It is our symbolic protest against the government’s plan to frame Rabi Lamichhane on false charges,” said Ekaraj Neupane, the RSP's Gandaki chairman. “We heard that Rabi Lamichhane would be arrested, so we staged demonstrations.” He said the party would also stage demonstrations on Tuesday if needed.On the other hand, victims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative took to the street demanding to detain Lamichhane stating that he is one of the accused in the cooperative fraud case. Speaking to reporters, the cooperative victims said that they were forced to stage demonstrations as the RSP activists pressured the government not to detain the suspect involved in cooperative fraud.The cooperative victims held their protest programme in front of the District Administration Office. The RSP activists gathered some 50 metres away in Sahidchowk chanted slogans in favour of Lamichhane. Anuradha Shrestha, a victim of Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative and ward committee member of the RSP, was in a dilemma about which side to join. She finally joined the cooperative victims and chanted slogans against the party's central chairman.Shrestha, aged 36, of Pokhara Metropolitan City-6 deposited her savings at Surya Darshan Cooperative. She had deposited a total of Rs1.6 million in the accounts of her, her husband and two sons.“I had even deposited the money that my sons received on their birthdays. I cannot forget my money deposited there,” she said. “If he [Lamichhane] is guilty, he should be punished. If he is not guilty, he should not be framed.”A good number of security personnel were deployed in the area to avert possible clashes between the rival groups. The parallel demonstrations were held within a distance of a few metres but there were no untoward incidents.Two weeks ago, the victims of the Surya Darshan Cooperative had waved black flags at Lamichhane who was in Pokhara to attend his party’s provincial meeting in Birauta.Hundreds of depositors from Surya Darshan Cooperative have been protesting for the past several months demanding return of their defrauded savings.On October 5 last year, police filed a fraud case at Kaski District Court against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of the Gorkha Media Network, and 18 other former and current directors and employees of the credit cooperatives, accusing them of embezzling over Rs1.1 billion.During the initial investigation, former home minister Lamichhane and Dipesh Pun, son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, were flagged as suspects. To advance the investigations, Kiran Bajracharya, then chief of the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police, deployed a team led by inspectors. \nAt least 190 women from 51 districts died of complications during childbirth in the fiscal year 2023-024, data provided by the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services show. The actual number of maternal deaths due to birth-related complications could be much higher, as maternal and perinatal death surveillance is being carried out in 51 districts only, officials say.“Maternal deaths from childbirth-related complications could be significantly underreported, as we are only tracking cases in 51 districts,” said Nisha Joshi, a public health official at the division. “We have no data on maternal and perinatal deaths in the rest of the districts.”In the fiscal year 2022-023, 191 maternal deaths were recorded across 49 districts. Nepal reduced the maternal mortality rate from 239 per 100,000 births in 2016 to 151 per 100,000 in 2021, according to the national census carried out by the National Statistics Office. Earlier, the country had reduced the maternal mortality rate from 539 per 100,000 births in 1996 to 239 per 100,000 births in 2016—for which the country even received a Millennium Development Goals award. The health target under the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce the maternal mortality rate to 75 per 100,000 births by 2030.The latest census report has shown that 622 maternal deaths were recorded in a year. Officials at the Health Ministry concede that the number of deaths reported from 51 districts is only around 30 percent of the total maternal deaths occurring across the country.They complained that the lack of maternal and perinatal death surveillance programmes in all districts is the main reason for the underreporting of maternal deaths. “Due to budget constraints, we could not expand the maternal and perinatal death surveillance to other districts this year,” said Joshi. “We also have problems in the reporting system, and deaths that occur in villages of the districts without surveillance programmes go unreported.”Maternal health experts say that concerned authorities are keeping themselves in the dark by not conducting studies in all districts. “Without knowing the actual situation, effective planning is not possible, which means efforts to reduce ongoing deaths may not succeed,” said Dr Ganesh Dangal, a maternal health expert. A huge budget is not necessary to carry out death surveillance. So this programme should be enforced mandatorily in all districts immediately.”Maternal and perinatal death surveillance is a key intervention for improving maternal, perinatal, and neonatal survival rates. Experts say such surveillance provides an understanding of the number and causes of deaths, enabling more targeted and effective interventions.Nepal strives to reduce the deaths of mothers and babies. However, it lacks maternal and perinatal death surveillance in all districts.Perinatal death is the death of a baby between 22 weeks of gestation (or weighing 500g) and seven days after birth.The World Health Organisation said that maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response (MPDSR) is an essential quality improvement intervention, which permits the identification, notification, quantification and determination of causes and avoidability of maternal and neonatal deaths and stillbirth to orient the measures necessary for their prevention.According to the UN health body, systematic analyses of overall mortality trends and events and contributing factors leading to individual deaths can identify barriers in health systems and inspire local solutions to prevent such deaths in the future.Studies carried out in the past show that excessive bleeding after childbirth, pre-eclampsia and eclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure disorders) are some of the reasons for maternal deaths.The World Health Organisation said postpartum haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal mortality in low-income countries and the primary cause of nearly a quarter of all maternal deaths globally. Most deaths resulting from the said complication occur during the first 24 hours after birth.Gynaecologists say tears in the cervix or tissues of the vagina, tear in a blood vessel in the uterus, bleeding in hidden tissue area or space in the pelvis, blood clotting disorders, and placenta problems are among the causes of postpartum haemorrhage.Every year, over 600,000 women deliver babies in Nepal. \nNepal’s winless streak in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 continued to five matches as they suffered a five-wicket defeat against Canada in the second leg of Canada Tri-Series in King City on Monday.It was Nepal’s third straight loss in King City, after also losing their previous tri-series matches against Canada by 103 runs and Oman by one wicket at the Maple Leaf.The Rhinos’ winless streak in the second edition of the League 2 stretches back to February when they lost against Namibia (by two wickets on February 21) and the Netherlands (by eight wickets on February 25) in the inaugural tri-series, which was held at the TU Cricket Ground in Kathmandu.Their only victory of the second edition of the League 2 came against the Dutch (by nine wickets on February 17) in Kirtipur. Before that, Nepal had lost the League opener to Namibia by four wickets.The losing run now puts a big question mark on the coaching style of Monty Desai, who was thought to have finally addressed Nepali’s batting inconsistencies when he guided Nepal to 11 victories in 12 matches in the last edition’s League 2 that secured Nepal a third spot and a place in the Cricket World Cup Qualifiers last year.But the batting problems—which has been their biggest headache in both T20 and ODI formats—has come back to haunt Nepal again.Desai dropped Kushal Bhurtel, who is having the worst year of his life, again and started Arjun Saud in the opening line-up with Aasif Sheikh.Big-hitter Dipendra Singh Airee and Kushal Malla were also benched, giving opportunities to Anil Sah and Aarif Sheikh.However the new faces have failed to give Nepal momentum.The openers also failed to give Nepal a good start for a second game in a row, with Saud falling for 10 and Aasif departing for a cheap two.Rohit Paudel’s team again had to rely on lower order batters to post 181 in 46.1 overs after seeing their top and middle order collapse humiliatingly.Nepal were in big trouble at 36-5 after losing Bhim Sharki (4), captain Rohit Paudel (4) and Ani Sah (1) cheaply, with Kaleem Sana (3-29) striking twice.Aarif Sheikh played 10 off 33 and Gulsan Jha—who scored a half-century and took a five-wicket haul against Oman on Wednesday—made 34 off 56 to drag Nepal to 87-7 after 27.1 overs. After Sana dispatched Aarif and Harsh Thaker removed Jha, Sompal Kami and Sandeep Lamichhane put on a 55-run stand for the eighth wicket to help Nepal post a respectable total.Kami walked back in 38.4 overs after making 21 off 48, trapped leg in front by Saad Bin Zafar.Lamichhane was denied his first ODI half-century when Thaker had him caught by Praveen on 49 runs in the 45.4. It was his career best ODI score. Lamichhane hit five fours and one six in his brave 48-ball knock.Karan KC then added 24 runs off 28 balls.In reply, Canada lost their opener Aaron Johnson for a duck in the 4.2 overs, caught by Gulsan Jha off KC. But Johnson’s opening partner Navneet Dhaliwal and Pragat Singh shared a 122-run stand for the second wicket to lay the foundation for victory.Dhaliwal scored 87 runs off 133 balls smashing eight fours and four sixes, while Singh made 64 off 83 balls. Singh cracked seven boundaries and two maximums.Jha took the wicket of Singh in the 30.3 overs and Lalit Rajbanshi sent back Dhaliwal in the 37.4 overs but Canada were already closer to target.Thaker then played 24-ball 13 and skipper Nicholas Kirton added 11 not out facing eight deliveries to guide Canada to 186-5 in 42 overs.Lamichhane took two wickets, that of Thaker and Akhil Kumar.It was Canada’s third straight victory in the tri-series and seventh overall in the League 2 from 11 matches. The Canadians lead the eight-team standings with 14 points.Nepal next play Oman on Tuesday. Oman are in the sixth position with two wins and three losses from six matches. Their match against Scotland in July yielded no result.Nepal lie in the seventh position with just two points after seven games.The United Arab Emirates are at the bottom, also on two points, but have played only five matches. \nThe District Attorney’s Office in Chitwan filed a case against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai and 16 others at the Chitwan District Court on Tuesday for the alleged embezzlement of savings from Sahara Chitwan Multipurpose Cooperative. However, Chitwan Police have not arrested anyone to date.According to district attorney Shanti Prasad Luintel, the case was filed based on an investigation report following complaints from 446 depositors of Sahara Cooperative. The complainants claimed that the cooperative failed to return savings totaling Rs376,584,546. The investigation report further mentions that the cooperative has 6,334 depositors with total savings amounting to Rs523,285,308.The district attorney's office has directed the police to reopen an investigation into the now defunct Gorkha Media, as funds from Sahara Cooperative appear to have been transferred there. The police are expected to submit a supplementary report on the matter.Kumar Ramtel, one of the board members of the Gorkha Media Network arrested by Kaski Police on charges of misappropriating cooperative funds and subsequently remanded in custody, was brought to Chitwan for questioning. Of the remaining 16 accused, 11 are on the run, 3 are already imprisoned, and 3 are absentees, according to the case filed.The attorney's office has also instructed Chitwan Police to further investigate the transactions amounting to Rs470 million, which was deposited into Gorkha Media's account at Global IME Bank, as details on the nature and parties involved in these transactions have not yet been fully uncovered.Earlier, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak directed the police to implement the report prepared and submitted by the parliamentary special investigation committee formed to probe the cooperatives scam. Consequently, Nepal Police’s ex-DIG Chhabilal Joshi was arrested from Kathmandu and produced before Kaski court for the investigation of allegations on cooperative-related fraud and organised crime. \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba has called upon the international community to assist in the safe release of Bipin Joshi, the Nepali student who has been in the Palestinian militant group Hamas captivity since October 7 last year.Addressing the Ministerial Meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) on Monday, Minister Rana drew attention to Joshi’s situation and urged global cooperation for his release.The foreign minister is in New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly.According to Minister Rana’s secretariat, she said that Nepal is eagerly awaiting Joshi’s return and appealed for international support.Joshi was abducted when Hamas attacked Israel on October 7, 2023. Ten Nepali students were killed in the armed attack.Minister Rana said the government condemned the attack and repeatedly called for Joshi’s safe release. She also stressed the need for collective global efforts to establish peace, pointing out that wars, rebellions, and violence persist in many parts of the world under various pretexts. “We are standing at one of the most critical junctures since World War II, with conflicts escalating worldwide. Prioritising the protection of civilians from armed conflict is more crucial than ever,” said Minister Rana.She further criticised the international community for failing to prevent ongoing conflicts and for not resolving the issues caused by wars, leaving citizens without peace and stability.“We are marking the 75th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, yet the principles for civilian protection enshrined in the conventions are being ignored or misinterpreted. This must end, and we must all work towards peaceful coexistence,” said Minister Rana.The foreign minister expressed her deep concern over the civilian casualties in Gaza and the suffering of people due to the Russia-Ukraine war. She called for an immediate end to such violent acts and for peaceful resolutions to these conflicts, stressing that violence serves no justice. \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee of the Federal Parliament rejected the nomination of Ram Krishna Bhattarai, an ambassador nominee for Sri Lanka, by a two-thirds majority on Tuesday.Earlier, Bhattarai had requested to withdraw his nomination from the hearing process after failing to present the required educational certificate proving he had completed his undergraduate degree. Tuesday marked 45 days since Bhattarai's recommendation as ambassador, and the committee was required to decide on his nomination. It had endorsed 16 out of 17 ambassadorial nominees on September 19.Ishwari Devi Neupane, chair of the hearing committee, informed that Bhattarai’s nomination was rejected by a two-thirds majority.Bhattarai was unable to provide the necessary documents as required by the ambassadorial appointment guidelines, which stipulate that nominees must have at least an undergraduate degree from a recognised university.The decision of the committee, which met on Tuesday, reads: “As the proposed nominee himself has expressed his desire to withdraw from the nomination for the position of Ambassador, his name is hereby rejected by a two-thirds majority of the committee members.”Bhattarai had informed the committee that he was unable to produce the necessary documents verifying his educational qualifications.The committee also urged the government to adhere to the principles of proportional and inclusive representation in ambassadorial appointments. The committee's decision called on the government to ensure that nominations were made in accordance with Article 282(1) of the Constitution of Nepal and Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Parliamentary Hearing Procedure 2080, which emphasised the need for proportional and inclusive representation.Several members of the hearing committee had raised concerns over the lack of proportional and inclusive representation in the ambassadorial appointments and questioned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba on why those principles had not been followed. The government faced criticism for not ensuring representation from marginalised communities such as Dalits, Madhesis, and Tharus when recommending 17 ambassadors.Additionally, the committee stressed the importance of considering candidates' qualifications when making ambassadorial appointments. The government was reminded to submit all necessary documents, including verified qualifications, along with the nomination for parliamentary hearings, as opposed to only submitting the nominee's name, as had been done in the past. \nAccording to a recent report published in this daily, at least 440 people have died by falling off cliffs in 10 districts of Karnali Province in the past 11 years. Salyan district topped the list with 117 deaths. Police said six people died in similar incidents in Karnali in the first two months of the current fiscal year 2024-25. A large number of other people were badly injured. Many of them lost their lives or limbs when they fell from cliffs and trees in the course of foraging for grass and firewood. People in this province, which is mostly covered in hills and mountains, often die while traversing risky roads and even while walking along treacherous paths carved into dizzying cliffs. It is a matter of shame for Nepal that a large number of its people are dying in the course of just going about their daily lives. This is not a problem specific to Karnali Province. People are killed in similar incidents across the country. Also, falls are taken as a serious problem around the globe, though the nature of incidents differ. It is the second leading cause of unintentional injury deaths worldwide. According to the World Health Organisation, each year, an estimated 684,000 individuals die from falls globally—and over 80 percent of these deaths are in low- and middle-income countries. A study titled “Fall injuries in Nepal: A countrywide population-based survey” identifies falls as a ‘crucial public health concern’.When it comes to safety measures, Nepalis in general seem negligent and the degree of negligence is more concerning in remote regions like Karnali. This calls for a serious awareness drive in order to make people take precautions and prevent such incidents. There must be more robust safety arrangements in accident-prone areas, and the rules must be strictly enforced. Extra effort is needed when such campaigns are run in low-literacy areas. Youth literacy in the Karnali Province is 66.17 percent, even as the national rate is 85 percent; the population of those in absolute poverty in the province is 28.9 percent, even as the national ratio is 18.7 percent.The provincial and local governments themselves need to devise plans and programmes to address this problem as they understand the local complications, people’s necessities, and the kind of alternative arrangements needed. When it comes to deaths from falls, the priority should obviously be prevention. For that, the local authorities need to devise alternative paths to more treacherous routes, fence off certain places and quickly repair the essential roads. In some cases, they may even need to restrict people’s movements in particularly dangerous zones.As vital is to properly handle the injuries after the incidents and prevent the condition of the injured from getting worse. Right now, many places in Karnali lack even basic healthcare services. Some injuries get worse when people either don’t know how to handle the injured people or don’t have access to stretchers to carry them. Carrying severely injured people long distances for treatment is particularly difficult. Many deaths and injuries could be avoided if only the local health facilities were equipped a little better, both in terms of equipment and manpower.  \nThe total revenue collection of the government, including the amount to be transferred to provincial and local governments, in the fiscal year 2023-24 that ended on July 15 stood at Rs1058.90 billion. It was short of the Rs1422.54 billion target by Rs363.64 billion or 25.56 percent. The total government revenue in the previous fiscal year was Rs957.35 billion, against the target of Rs1403.14 billion, a whopping shortfall of 31.77 percent. The trend is equally pessimistic in the current fiscal year. The revenue target is Rs1419.3 billion. The average collection per day, which should be at least Rs3.88 billion to meet this target, is only Rs2.53 billion. As of September 22, or in 69 days of the fiscal year, the total collection is only Rs178 billion, which should have been around Rs269 billion. It is barely 12.58 percent of the annual target against the expected 19 percent to have been collected by now.A macro trend is apparent. For years, the government has shied away from setting a revenue target above Rs1400 billion. This revenue-GDP ratio has rapidly declined. In the last five years, the average annual revenue shortfall has remained at least 25 percent off target. This is a grave cause of concern mainly because there is no sign of substantial improvement in the collection. The traditional sources of revenue are shrinking, and the government appears completely clueless or impervious in exploring new revenue sources or expanding the existing tax base.Such a low revenue collection has made the country's public financial management challenging. The government is resorting to borrowing without hesitation. As of mid-September, Nepal’s public debt reached Rs2.52 trillion. The government borrowed Rs104 billion only in the past two months. The public debt-GDP ratio climbed to 44.34 percent from 28 percent a decade ago. Nepal's current GDP is Rs5.704 trillion.Tax reformThe proponents of state-led growth often seem to focus rather monolithically on distributive justice and expenses on every facility, such as health, education, infrastructure and social security, which the state should staff. They also argue that the rich should be taxed more to generate revenue for the same. Nevertheless, a mammoth caveat in this redistributive model is that it does not prescribe a recipe to expand the private sector growth, which produces more riches and enlarges the tax net.A key agenda in the ten-principle Washington Consensus, which the socialists of state-led growth schools view as 'the' theoretical weapon to globalise neoliberalism, is tax reform. The third principle of the 'theory' is categoric in stating: “Reforms should broaden the tax base and remove tax exemptions that exclude some politically connected taxpayers and organizations. Broadening and simplifying taxes can promote efficiency, improve tax collection, and reduce tax evasion.” Nepal's tax reform has comprehensively failed. A recent report prepared by a 'high-level committee' commissioned by the Ministry of Finance has pointed out that Nepal's tax-paying process and the tax system are complex. Tax compliance and tax risk management are suboptimal, and the implementation of key revenue-related laws—income, excise duty, customs and value-added tax (VAT)—is compromised by the weak and non-committed revenue administration. The practice of tax rate adjustment through annual fiscal bills has only added to policy instability and unpredictability. The tax exemption is ad hoc and massive, causing an estimated loss of about Rs200 billion annually. Lack of digitisation, automation and poor database management of the taxpayers have left loopholes for taxpayer-tax officer collusion and led to large tax evasion.This report states that the number of corporate taxpayers is only 261,815. However, the annual report (FY 2022-23) of the Inland Revenue Department data shows that the number of VAT-registered firms is 308,000, permanent account number (PAN) registration is 1.87 million, and registration on excise duty is 116,000. Individual PAN registration is 3.37 million. But regular taxpayers, including salary and wage earners, are estimated to be only about 2 million. This is indicative of a very narrow tax base.Tax justiceThe tax-to-GDP ratio in Nepal is about a quarter of its GDP, which is considered a high rate of tax imposition. But the fact is, the larger portion of the economy, in a rough estimate of about two-thirds of it, is a shadow economy or in no way accounted for in GDP calculation, which shows the ratio to be disproportionately high.Tax justice comprises two complementary ideas. First, the nation-state must adopt a progressive tax policy, meaning that those earning more should pay more. Also, the portion of direct tax earnings for the state should invariably be higher than the collection from indirect taxes. This is because indirect taxes like the sales tax service tax, VAT, excise duty and customs duty on goods are uniformly applicable to the poor and the rich. However, direct taxes like income tax, corporate tax, land revenue, capital gain tax and expenditure tax are levied only on those who earn. They constitute only about one-third of the total tax collection in Nepal. Similarly, the tax rates based on the income slab that ranges from 1 percent of income to 39 percent are considered stratified in many levels and too high for salary and wage earners, whereas the capital gain tax from the land and property transactions is not properly implemented. The concept of redistribution of wealth through appropriately designed tax policies, or redistributive justice, has also been blatantly compromised by the Nepali state. The state's objective should be to reduce inequalities in consumption, income and wealth among the population by redistributing the wealth and providing public services and social security to the marginalised and deprived sections. According to an OXFAM report, the income of the richest 10 percent of Nepalis is more than three times that of the poorest 40 percent of the population. The poorest 20 percent have only 4 percent of the wealth.Some policymakers recommend drastic measures like taxing based on wealth accumulation and imposing inheritance tax on ancestral properties. This is easier said than done. However, without substantially improving the revenue base, the state will soon be unable to finance regular/recurrent expenditures, let alone ensure redistributive justice. \nIndian politicians have argued for decades that the nation deserves to be a member of the United Nations Security Council (UNSC). An aspirational superpower, India believes that it has been unfairly denied a seat at the high table.Several visiting foreign political dignitaries and international coalitions that have pushed for UNSC reforms have also voiced support for India’s candidacy for permanent membership of the Security Council. However, despite persistent lobbying by India, experts are not hopeful of change in the near future.There are four key challenges India must overcome before it secures veto power in the United Nations.China’s oppositionAmong the five permanent Security Council members all except China—the US, the UK, France, and Russia—have categorically supported India’s candidature in the past. As a close competitor of India in regional and international politics, China—the only Asian country with a security council seat—is unwilling to endorse New Delhi’s position. This adds to its power and international prestige, and China is unlikely to want to share this space with India. What’s more, particularly amid an ongoing border dispute with India, China will resist any attempt by any of the four members to change the composition of the UNSC.China is also uncomfortable with Japan, a close US ally that, like India, is a strong contender for a permanent seat. China has unofficially dropped hints that it may back India, provided New Delhi doesn’t endorse Japan’s bid. China knows that New Delhi will not break the unity of the G-4 (comprising Brazil, Germany, India, and Japan, are four countries which support each other’s bids for permanent seats on the security council) and thus, considers it is a safe bet to pit India against Japan.Membership without veto powerSome parties have raised the prospect of India gaining UNSC membership without veto power. Groups including Uniting for Consensus (UfC)—a powerful coalition led by Italy, with other members including Canada, Mexico, Spain, Pakistan, South Korea and Turkey—have advocated reinforcing the working of the General Assembly and increasing the number of non-permanent members.Its argument is that the addition of non-permanent members will make the UN more accountable and representative by accommodating relevant regional voices in the decision-making process. In doing so, the group argues, this solution would mean there are more than a few select chief custodians of the international system.But there are questions about what happens if India gets a high seat without veto power. Could this be considered a piecemeal approach towards achieving the larger objective? Despite some parties saying they prefer this kind of arrangement, New Delhi is not comfortable with this proposition. India’s position is that all new permanent members to the Security Council must possess a veto. Thus, it is unlikely this outcome will unfold.Western concerns The US has, in principle, endorsed India gaining a permanent seat on the Security Council. But not everyone believes US policymakers will actually support such a reform in practice. Indeed, in the past, P-5 countries have displayed “a habit of being non-commital” when it comes to actual decision-making on veto powers. As former US Under Secretary of State for Political Affairs Nicholas Burns said in 2008: “We want to preserve the veto, and we do not want to extend a veto to new permanent members.”Prominent US-based South Asian expert Ashley Tellis recently penned a piece in Foreign Affairs magazine arguing that the US cannot be sure of India’s support on significant strategic matters. Ashley later defended this position in an interview, saying “the current war in Ukraine is a good example … India defines its interest in ways that are not always identical to our own”.It is true that India has not always voted with the West in the UN and has maintained an independent position on several critical subjects (e.g., India abstaining from the Russian invasion of Ukraine). Due to this, many think India is a fence-sitter and see it as an unreliable partner. The West, particularly after the Russian-Ukraine war, is more watchful of new geopolitical reality. The understanding that Russia may fail to secure any support in the world for its war has changed.Despite developing closer strategic ties with the West, India remained uncommitted on supporting sanctions on Russia. While China’s response was anticipated, for the West, foot dragging by New Delhi in criticising Russia was no less than a shock. In these changed circumstances, it is difficult to imagine that the West, particularly the US, will go ahead with a reformed security council where India has veto power.The regional conundrumIndia also faces formidable challenges to its leadership emanating from its own region. India influences the region, but not in absolute terms. Indeed, as instability in the region has increased, so too have New Delhi’s troubles. South Asia has become a battleground of India-China competition.And while the India-Pakistan rivalry captures most attention, there are major India-related issues that agitate people in Nepal, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives and even in Bhutan.With its recent change of government, Bangladeshis no longer on the same page. Queries over India’s regional leadership raises questions over its claims to be a global power.Next steps for IndiaThere are convincing arguments that the UN is in desperate need of reform, particularly the Security Council. Expanding the Security Council’s membership to include developing countries like India would benefit the UN and the international community. However, New Delhi must make more concerted efforts to address criticisms to further legitimise its demand for permanent membership.India’s geographical, political, and social influence in South Asia cannot be ignored. Recent criticism around its increasing political intolerance—which is directly linked to the state of democracy in India—must be addressed and resolved.India’s failure to improve its ranking in the Human Development Index, the issue of economic inequality, and its lack of world-class infrastructure all contribute to the nation’s global image. Therefore, there are structural and more prominent geopolitical factors that overshadow India’s chances to acquire security council permanent membership.Additionally, India needs better engagement with the region and much more internal work to strengthen its claim further.-360info \nThe Covid-19 pandemic brought untold misery to Nepal. Over 12,000 people died from the virus. The national economy was decimated, and tourism came to a juddering halt. Yet even this darkest of clouds had a silver lining: The pandemic accelerated Nepal’s switch to a cashless economy. The four months of a hard lockdown in 2020, followed by many more months of limited mobility, forced even the otherwise digitally illiterate people to gradually take up online transactions, to pay for everything from daily vegetables to power bills. Digital payments shot up by 18 percent year-on-year in the final month of the fiscal year 2021-22, to hit Rs6.22 trillion. The corresponding figure for the previous fiscal was 5.26 trillion, which in turn was almost the double of the figure of Rs2.76 trillion in the fiscal 2019-20. There have of late been more indications of digitisation. According to the Nepal Rastra Bank, the number of cheques presented at banks dropped by 8.97 percent, from 16.72 million in 2021-22 to 15.22 million in the fiscal year 2022-23. In the same period, the number of transactions done through Quick Response (QR) codes doubled.This is something to be celebrated as a cashless economy has many benefits over a cash-based one. In a country where corruption has come to be synonymous with government service, digitisation can clean up governance and service-delivery. For instance, when people start paying online to renew driving licences or to clear land taxes, the role of the middlemen, who are responsible for most corruption in Nepal, will be reduced. There is also no question of such middlemen syphoning off the monthly stipends for the elderly and single women—something that routinely happened in the past—when such payments go directly into the bank accounts of the beneficiaries. It is also harder to cheat on taxes online. More obviously, when you can pay your electricity and water bills from the confines of your home, the hassle of having to physically visit these offices and stand in long lines is removed. During the pandemic, looking to make themselves useful, even older folks started learning e-business from their more tech-savvy and younger family members. So the country has come a long way in e-transactions since the dark days of Covid. Things could be better though. The government, instead of helping with the process, often hinders e-commerce. For instance, online transactions are still taxed. The government says it will fully refund taxes on such transactions. Such refunds are rare. But why at all impose taxes that have to be refunded? Internet costs in Nepal are also high. According to the Connectivity in the Least Developed Countries Status Report 2021, Nepalis pay more for internet access than most other South Asians. In 2020, Nepalis had to spend 2.6 percent of their gross annual income to buy internet service, much more than what their counterparts in India, Sri Lanka or Pakistan forked out, where the corresponding cost was under 1 percent. It does not help that Nepali e-business laws are ambiguous and discouraging for online service providers. If only the most obvious and easiest roadblocks are cleared, the country will be on its way to a near full digitisation of its economy in the near future—to immeasurable benefit for the wellbeing of common Nepalis.   \nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) reported on Monday that Nepal's economy is displaying early signs of recovery, emphasising the importance of addressing vulnerabilities within savings and credit cooperatives as a national priority.\"Incoming high-frequency data shows import growth is turning positive, tax collections are improving, and public investment is gaining momentum,\" stated an IMF staff team, led by Sarwat Jahan, following their visit to Kathmandu, which concluded on Sunday.The 12-day visit, which commenced on 11 September, focused on recent macroeconomic developments and the implementation of the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF)-supported programme.The IMF’s statement noted, \"Credit growth is recovering, while remaining appropriately below nominal GDP growth. Inflation has continued to decelerate, reaching around 3.6 percent by mid-July, partly due to favourable commodity prices and weak demand. International reserves are on the rise, supported by strong remittances, recovering tourism, and still subdued imports.\"The statement stressed the importance of accelerating reform efforts to place the economy on a path of sustainable, strong, and inclusive growth.\"This will require enhancing the execution of public investment, further strengthening domestic revenue mobilisation, and ensuring the prompt disbursement of Child Grants.\"The IMF also highlighted the need for continued vigilance as banks manage elevated non-performing loans and capital constraints, recommending further strengthening of regulations and the completion of loan portfolio reviews for the ten largest banks.Addressing vulnerabilities within savings and credit cooperatives remains a key priority. \"The recent amendments to the Anti-Money Laundering Act are a positive step. Amendments to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act, the completion of the NRB’s external audit, and increased transparency in public enterprises will enhance governance and accountability. Additionally, the Investment Facilitation Act will improve Nepal’s investment climate.\"The IMF commended the government’s ongoing efforts to meet key commitments under the Fund-supported programme, with the support of IMF technical assistance. \nChandra Bhandari scored a hat-trick as Tribhuvan Army Club defeated Waling Municipality 8-0 at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Tuesday that guaranteed them at least second position in the ANFA Women’s League.Bimala BK and Amisha Karki scored a brace in their dominant display at Satdobato that gave Army 19 points from eight matches.Army have already qualified for the Super League and will now aim to dethrone defending champions and leaders Armed Police Force Club from the top of the ten team standings when they take on already-eliminated Karnali Province in their final league match on Friday.APF have 22 points and can progress to the Super League as table toppers if they defeat or draw against Bagmati Youth Club in their last first round match, also scheduled for Friday.Bagmati beat Sankata 3-1 in the day’s other action to climb to sixth position that also boosted their hopes to reach the second round. However, they face a formidable challenge in their next fixture against a relentless APF.Nepal Police Club, who have two games in hand, have also qualified for the second round with 15 points.Despite the defeat, Waling occupy the fourth spot with 12 points and can ensure a top-five finish with a victory against Chandrapur on Thursday.Koshi are fifth with a game in hand and are the most favoured side to progress because they have an easy match-up against tournament’s weakest side Supurpaschim, who are still winless and sit at the bottom. For Sankata, Tuesday’s defeat against Bagmati is a big blow to their hopes of advancing to the next round. They must defeat Police and hope Koshi falter against Sudurpaschim to stand any chance of progressing.Army are one of the strongest and clinical sides in the league and on Tuesday, they showed their intent for their maiden women’s league title, handing Waling their biggest defeat of the season.Army went in front in the 38th minute when Waling goalkeeper Sanjina Majhi failed to make a routine save, allowing BK’s long-ranged strike to slip into the net.Bhandari doubled Army’s lead in the 43rd minute, sending a low shot past advancing Majhi after Karki set her up.Army went into the break 3-0 up, courtesy of an own goal from Fatumah Nakasumba, who put a corner from Hima Chaudhary into her own post.Bhandari furthered Army’s lead in the 54th minute following a well-coordinated team effort, which was followed by Karki’s two goals in the 62nd and 71st minute, both assisted by Dipa Shahi.Bhandari completed her hat-trick three minutes later, converting a pass from substitute Dikshya Gurung.BK then netted her second and Army’s eighth goal in the 90th with a stunning long-range effort.Sankata were looking to cap a dream season by reaching the second round in their league debut but Gifty Acheampong’s double and a late goal from Pushpa Kumari Khadka left them in the seventh position, three behind fifth-placed Koshi.Senegalese Acheampong gave Bagmati the lead in the 68th minute with a brilliant volley and furthered the lead in the 76th minute with a solo effort.Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye reduced the deficit in the 83rd minute with a powerful shot after Mamata Pun put her through.Bagmati should have extended the lead to 3-0 when they were awarded a penalty in the first minute of stoppage time but their captain Divya Yasmali Magar missed it.But Khadka put the result beyond doubt in dying seconds tapping in a cross from Gifty. \nPolice arrested four individuals on the charge of providing false information to get citizenship from different areas of Kathmandu.According to Police Headquarters, the arrestees are Madan Bahadur Tamang,31 and Rameshwar Rijal,56, of Dhading, Chhiring Dhundup,53, of Tibet China and Chhiring Wangdi Sherpa,46, of Sindhupalchowk.While investigating the Nepali citizenship of Tibetan national Sonam, the police found that Wangdi Sherpa had facilitated getting it for Sonam under the name of Sonam Tamang by reportedly taking Rs 400,000 from him. They had procured citizenship from the district administration office in Dhading.Sonam was apprehended on charges relating to gambling. \nThe National Assembly’s Gender Equality and Family Committee approved a bill to strengthen punishment against deepfake sex crimes and victim support Monday, with the aim of passing it during a plenary session on Thursday.During Monday’s committee meeting, representatives of both the ruling and opposition party approved amendments to the Juvenile Protection Act and the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Protection Act.According to the amendments made to the Juvenile Protection Act, using sexually exploitative material to blackmail or coerce minors will be punishable by law.Current laws punish such crimes with imprisonment of one or more years in the case of blackmail and three or more years in the case of coercion. According to Monday’s amendment, these sentences are respectively raised to three or more years and five or more years when such crimes target minors.Additionally, the amendment also allows police officials to conduct urgent undercover investigations without needing prior approval from higher authorities when investigating digital sex crimes using deepfakes.The revision to the Sexual Violence Prevention and Victims Protection Act specifies that it is the government’s responsibility to delete illegally filmed materials and to help victims proceed with their daily lives. To help with the victims’ recovery, the revision establishes a basis for both central and local governments to operate help centers for digital sex crime victims.The revised bills are expected to be discussed and voted on by the Legislation and Judiciary Committee sometime this week, aiming to pass during the plenary session scheduled on Thursday.Meanwhile, the head of the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency stated during a press briefing on Monday that the agency is investigating 74 deepfake crime suspects on charges of creating or distributing deepfake pornographic videos on Telegram.“Currently, 126 cases are under investigation and 74 suspects have been identified,” said Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency Commissioner Kim Bong-sik, saying the agency created a special task force late last month to crack down on deepfake porn crimes intensively.According to Kim, most of the suspects caught so far are teenagers, accounting for up to 51 people out of the 74 suspects. This was followed by those in their 20s with 21 people, and the remaining two in their 30s.-ANN \nNepal Television's Hem-Sunil Risky Television Journalism Award recognizes Kantipur journalists for reporting from Israel and NTV journalists reporting from Api Himal in 2024.\nShiva Adhikari, a Nepali in Germany, becomes the first Nepali member of the Integration Conference advising the Hessian government on integration policies.\nThe U.S. commits $500 million and 1 million mpox vaccine doses to African nations to combat the virus's spread, calling on other countries to assist in the global effort.\nTribhuvan University mandates exam cancellation for AI usage and grants supplementary exams to eligible students.\nPresident Zelensky urged decisive US action to end Russia's Ukraine invasion, stating Ukraine was close to the war's end after presenting a \"victory plan\" seeking NATO membership and Russian troop withdrawal.\nDriven by dissatisfaction with traditional workplaces and valuing flexibility, mental well-being, and career growth, young professionals in Nepal, like Gen Z and millennials, are increasingly embracing job-hopping in pursuit of fulfilling work environments.\nARIES (March 21-April 19) Take a moment to connect with and sort your emotions before starting the day, finding ways to self-soothe and move forward.

Arriving here just before the 2022 elections, he has since closely observed Nepali politics and society. Umesh Chauhan and Biswas Baral recently sat down with Thompson to reflect on his time in Nepal, major US projects in the country including those under the MCC, geopolitical competition with China, trade, and a range of other issues.How have you seen Nepali politics evolve in the two years you have been in the country? What events stood out? I’ve seen a lot of Nepali politics. Obviously, there’s been a lot of changes. I got here right before the national elections in November 2022. It was really great to see the democratic process play out here, to see Nepalis turn out in such great numbers and make their choices known.Democracy is such a vibrant and colourful exercise anywhere in the world. Nepal did not disappoint on that front. It's been fascinating to watch it evolve, to watch the governments come in different formations.What’s been great is the commitment we’ve seen from successive groups in government to moving forward and carrying forward the [bilateral] partnership and building on projects. I’ve also been amazed at some of the innovative things happening in various sectors of the economy.There has been some very exciting work in the IT sector, for example, that runs the gamut from more traditional back-office type operations to cutting-edge AI research, to developing educational apps for school students, to things like what we have been sponsoring at our Content Creator’s Mela these past two years. It is great to see Nepalis show lots of creativity in expressing themselves and talking about their culture and their society in so many different ways. Across the board, I’d say the experience has been unique.How have the Nepal-US relations evolved over the past 77 years of diplomatic ties? What are the salient features of the relationship? What I would say is we’ve always tried to listen, to engage with the Nepali society. Based on that, I think one of the things that we’ve done is refine the range of products.The Peace Corps, the USAID, the Millennium Challenge Corporation, the Development Finance Corporation, or other elements of our assistance and development commitments—these are different tools that can be employed. And Nepal has continually expanded its capacity to take advantage of them. The US has been able to increase the number of tools and assets, if you will, that Nepal can use to build its economy.I’m very proud of the fact that we have done this primarily through grant-based assistance, so that there is little in terms of downsides. At the same time, we have focused on different segments of the economy or society, for example, through the Development Finance Corporation, we’re now able to target and work with the financial sector to create more opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises, particularly women-run enterprises. Through the USAID, we can use more of the traditional mechanisms of assistance.The Millennium Challenge Corporation kind of speaks for itself. It targets large-scale, massive infrastructure type projects that aim to be transformative in terms of Nepal’s economy. It has helped grow the road and infrastructure network and show new technology that can help expand that network and make roads safer, more reliable, and easier to maintain. It has helped build an electricity infrastructure that allows Nepal, first and foremost, to internally use the green hydropower that's at its disposal, but there will be excess capacity even to export it to the region to earn additional income. So I’m pretty excited about what I’ve seen happen over the past 77 years, and where we are today. I’m also extremely positive about building on where we are now. Can you give us a status of the implementation of projects under the Millennium Challenge Account Nepal? In the MCC, energy, obviously, is a high-priority area and so is transportation. Where we are with the projects themselves is we have let out the contracts for the sub-stations, for the 18-kilometre cross-border transmission line, and we have reissued the tender for the 297-kilometre broader transmission line package that had to be revised due to some cost changes over the time it took to implement that piece of the package.But we’re pretty positive about getting that back on track by the end of the year and putting the project firmly on the right footing for a five-year completion timeline. But there have also been hurdles, right? Do you still expect the transmission lines and road projects to be completed in five years?I expect there to be more hurdles. The biggest challenge was when the bids came back for the 297-kilometre transmission line. We had a number of delays there from Covid to worldwide inflation, to supply chain shifts that I don’t think people had foreseen completely. I’m not surprised. But the MCC has had a lot of experience around the world with these projects.It builds into this assumption that there will be challenges, there will be situations that need to be rethought and overcome. The real trick is making sure we move forward in a way that’s smart and focused on keeping things on time and on track. We're fortunate in the case of Nepal because we have a partner that has so heavily invested its own resources into the project.We have our $500 million grant and Nepal is putting in almost $200 million. It’s been made a national pride project. Look, other things will inevitably come up. But we believe that we have a good team that’s ready to tackle those types of challenges and press forward.At the end of the day, this can serve as a really positive model for how development assistance and how large-scale infrastructure projects can be implemented in a partnership that is largely the result of an internal domestic process. Don’t forget, Nepal requested the MCC project. The government of Nepal, through a consultative process, developed the idea, designed the project, and is now its lead implementer.We’re a financier and a partner but it is very much a Nepal-owned effort. Talking about challenges, there are many local governments and we have to deal with them every 10 to 15 kilometres in the project areas. Different communities have different concerns and priorities. This can add to some difficulty.What do you think will happen to the project if it cannot meet the five-year deadline?The fate of the project is to be completed in its entirety in five years. I can't speak to whether there’s going to be a particular challenge to delay it by six months or seven months or something like that. Right now, in our planning and projection, we hope that we can move it forward within the timeline.If it needs to go beyond that, we’ll work closely with our partner and figure it out. I’m confident that the $500 million that the US government is providing will be spent within the five years and it will lay a firm foundation for the completion of the project.But coming back to your scenario, indeed, you have different communities. A lot of people are affected by this. Now, on the one hand, that's why we encourage and insist on a consultative process, on everything being as transparent as possible so people know exactly what’s going to happen, that they know what the money is being spent on, what the effects will be in terms of how many trees will have to be cut down or what roads will be built where. That’s very important to us: no surprises for the communities that are out there.I think that we will rely on a lot of that effort to help us propel the project forward if things do get challenging on other fronts as well.Like you said, the project does need to be completed by a deadline of five years. Just in case it doesn’t, what happens?Look, it is an ambitious undertaking. There’s no question about it, right? And the Millennium Challenge Corporation is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. The MCA Nepal is committed to making it happen within that five-year period. But they’re also working closely together to make sure that it’s being done in a proper way, in a transparent way, and I’m confident that we will be able to complete what we need to complete. I’m also sure there’s a firm commitment from the government that if there’s a little piece left over here or there, to make sure it goes forward.I don’t worry about the ultimate completion of the project. I’m more focused on how we get it going as quickly as possible, because just the implementation of the project itself should employ close to 10,000 Nepalis, right? I really want communities to start to see the benefit of the project as soon as possible, because that’s where the transformative nature of it comes into play. Part of it is building it. Part of it is implementing it. Part of it is learning from that process. But then having this infrastructure in place, that’s what really changes the dynamic in Nepal and in the economic well-being of the country.Some fear that a failure to complete the project on time could even create rifts in our bilateral ties.I don’t think they should be fearful. We are partners in this, and if there’s any issue, if we're going to work through it together. What we should be doing is focusing entirely on implementing the project to its fullest potential as quickly as possible.Let’s move to geopolitics. What we see in the region is seemingly an exclusivist India-China geopolitical competition. Indians appear reluctant to work with the regimes that work closely with China. It's almost like they are saying, it's either the Chinese or us. How do you see this geopolitical dynamics playing out in Nepal? And where do the Americans fit in this picture?Yeah, it’s a good question in terms of the dynamic that’s in play today and where things are headed. We have of course been watching the India-China relationship and its development over the past few years with some degree of concern. Obviously, there was conflict there some years ago, and I think they’ve been trying to manage that since.And there’s no question that other countries in the region feel that very powerfully. From our standpoint, what we would like to see is the countries of the region—and particularly Nepal because that’s where I’m accredited and that’s where I have some level of knowledge—exercise their sovereignty and to have the space that they need to make decisions about they own future on behalf of their people in a positive way.We don’t believe countries should be asked to choose. We fully expect that Nepal is going to have good relations with India and China. They’re two neighbours. They’re large countries. They’re important countries in the region. It’s critically important for Nepal that it works with and benefits from both India and China.At the same time, we see no reason that should have any effect on our relationship with Nepal, and no reason Nepal should not be fully able to take full advantage of what the US has to offer. We will continue to watch and continue to work closely with Nepal as a partner and to encourage it to exercise its sovereignty and its decision-making in a way that benefits the Nepali people. The US-China relations are also very dicey at the moment. Surely this has some effect on how the US perceives the Chinese role around the world, including in Nepal.We had a recent high-level visit by our National Security Advisor [to China]. We’ve had recent visits by the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Treasury. I think there’s a real effort to try to manage what we all acknowledge is as a competition that’s underway, in a way that’s positive and can maybe move us more towards some type of cooperative element.That channel should continue to be pursued by the US and China, but it’s not reflective of our relationship with Nepal, or our relationship with India. This is about what we can do together [with Nepal]. I’m not going to comment on what other countries may be saying about us, how they may be trying to influence us.I would commit to us remaining as transparent as possible so Nepalis can make their own decisions about what's happening by our relationship.Recently, the Americans were blamed for ousting Sheikh Hasina from Bangladesh. The US is also often accused of meddling in the domestic affairs of other South Asian states, and in other parts of the world for that matter. How do you respond to this accusation?First off, I think you’ve got to take with a grain of salt anything that’s being said by someone who’s been forced to flee their country. The United States simply does not meddle in the internal politics of other countries. We work very hard to be as transparent as we possibly can about our relationships, about what we’re doing, about what we intend.That’s not to say that if we disagree vehemently with a country about a certain policy or a certain issue, we won’t raise it. But this idea that the US would find some benefit in enacting a change in government like that, it simply isn’t part of our repertoire of diplomacy. What we rather look to do is build the strongest relationships that we can.We love to do that primarily through people-to-people relationships and sponsoring as much development opportunity as we possibly can with our partner countries. So, I put no stock in these types of rumours and statements.There is also this sentiment that the Americans and the Indians are increasingly working together on strategic issues, and the same is seen even in South Asia.Certainly, there’s been a huge growth in the strategic partnership between the US and India. I think we want to see that continue to move forward in a positive way. At the same time, there have been disagreements between the US and India on various fronts, just as we have disagreements with many of our partners. And we try to deal with those in a proactive, professional and productive way.But, again, we see our relationship with each individual country through a bilateral lens. So if there are ways that the US and India working together can be beneficial, and another country agrees to such a cooperation, fine. But when it comes to Nepal, we’re going to base our relationship and our efforts first and foremost on our bilateral discussions and our bilateral relationship.Even as we speak, the US and Nepali armies are undertaking joint training in Nepal. How would you characterise the relations between the two armies?Yeah, the PAC ANGEL exercise is going on, focused on disaster relief, humanitarian assistance. The relationship between the two militaries has been strong, it remains strong, and I think it will continue to be strong primarily because we focus it on the areas Nepal wants to focus on—which is building a Nepal army that is capable of responding to disasters, providing humanitarian assistance, and then serving as part of the global peacekeeping network through the United Nations as the largest contributor force of peacekeepers. It’s in our interest to see Nepal continue to professionalise and develop its capacity on those fronts. That’s where our focus is, and that’s where we will continue to make efforts.There has also been a lot of debate in Nepal on the Indo-Pacific Strategy (IPS) and its applicability to South Asia. What is the current state of its application?The Indo-Pacific Strategy is a broad, big strategy by the United States government about how it looks at the entire region. And so it’s about how we create an open, independent, sovereign Indo-Pacific region for the benefit of all the people in the region.What we will continue to do is employ it to build relationships we have with each of the countries in the region. How can we continue to support democratic development? How can we continue to support economic development? Let’s not forget a huge portion, maybe 60 percent of the world’s commerce transits the Indo-Pacific corridor in some way, shape, or form every year.It’s in everyone’s interest for that to remain open and free. And for the countries of the region to be able to act in a sovereign way in their own interests.There is also a sizable section of Nepalis who believe that the IPS was brought with the intent of countering China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), and that Nepal is struggling to find a balance between the two. What is your reading?The USAID, the MCC, the Development Finance Corporation, all of our development programmes have a singular purpose, which is to work with our bilateral partners to grow their economies, to make them more able to meet the needs of their people. That’s the goal. That's how they were designed. And that’s how we will continue to treat them.The BRI is China's initiative. It’s pushing that forward. It’s up to each country to decide how it wants to engage with others. We believe the model of, say, a USAID or an MCC is proving itself to be beneficial to countries, as they are grant-based and economic growth oriented. We’ll continue to push them because we think the data and historical experience we’ve had support them.I think it’s incumbent on us to try to help all of our partners relate to us as equals in any realm that we’re working together. That’s critically important and something we have to acknowledge and something we have to make sure that they’re able to acknowledge.It's about building trust, about showing that our intent is correct, that we have the best interest of our partners in mind, and that we’re applying the same and transparent standards universally.For example, on the MCC, we’ve published everything on the internet. If anybody in Nepal has a question about any aspect of the project, they can go to the website, they can read about the project, they can see the blueprints, they can know exactly what it’s going to involve. That's how I think we build relationships.I think if I came to Nepal and said, hey, I want to do X project because I want to counter this country, I don’t think I would get very good reception. We just don’t look at the world that way. It’s not a healthy approach in the long run.But a bilateral focus that seeks to empower the people of a country—that’s where I think we have the best chance of moving forward. Nepal’s Parliament has finally passed an amendment to the transitional justice law. How does the US see this development? How do you see the transitional justice process progressing?I think this is a really important step in the process. I would say that we remain positive about the way it's going and we are looking to see how we can help. You noted, I’m sure, that we joined a number of other partner countries in issuing a statement of support after the Parliament passed it.We all know bringing a conflict of this scale to conclusion is always going to be a challenge. The TJ legislation has passed, which was a tough hurdle, but implementation will also be difficult.We’re looking forward to figuring out how we can be supportive, and how other partners can be supportive. Some of that may be through bilateral means. Some of it may be through multilateral means.But what I remain encouraged about, in particular, is, we’ve always said this needs to be a Nepali-run process. It has been. That it needs to be victim-centric. I believe that it is. And so we need to make sure the consultative piece of this remains alive as you move to implementation, so that the victims groups, so that the child soldier groups, so that other entities that have been involved continue to have a voice and continue to work together to figure out how to resolve this, to make reparations work, to bring justice in those cases. And so, we are positive.Thousands of Nepali youths are leaving the country every single day in search of better jobs. In this light, do you see the prospect of greater American FDI helping Nepal build a more robust economy that can create enough good jobs?I do. At the beginning of the interview, I talked about some sectors of the economy that are quite exciting right now. I think you’re seeing a lot of interest from the US in the IT sector, the tourism sector, in the health sector, and in the energy sector as it continues to develop.We’re very keen to look for ways to bring more US investment here, whether it’s through equity sort of vehicles, or direct bilateral investments. I think that can also be positive. I think Nepal did a good job in setting up that April Investment Summit. That sent a really positive signal. You’ll recall that we had a representative from the US Chamber of Commerce, Atul Keshap, come out for that. We’ve had a great run of senior US visitors out here over the last year and a half.I think the key right now is for Nepal, through its private sector, through its government, to figure out how to make the environment for investment in Nepal as attractive as it can possibly be. In this interview, we’ve talked about the idea of competition between countries. One place where I will absolutely acknowledge there’s competition is in trying to attract investment.And so Nepal needs to figure out how to make itself as attractive as possible, and how to make it as easy as possible to do business. That helps not only investments that come from other countries, but makes it easier for Nepalis to start businesses, right? It makes it easier for Nepalis to operate and do what they want. And so, in addition to welcoming, say, US companies or British companies or Canadian companies, we would also love to see Nepalis who have gone abroad come back and start to help in building the economy here.We’ve seen how capable and how dynamic they are in building other people’s economies. Let’s do the same here at home.I mentioned that the trade and investment framework talks that we have with Nepal are in their seventh round. I look forward to, in the rest of my tenure here, to continue to build the momentum that will allow investment to take shape and the economy here to thrive. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nRepresentatives at the first national conference of the Rastriya Swatantra Party saw factionalism within the party.Some of the representatives who arrived in Kathmandu three days ago for the two-day gathering starting on Tuesday said that growing factionalism is not healthy for the new political outfit promising to challenge traditional forces like the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.“We were told that factionalism existed in our party in various forms, but we denied such claims. However, during our three days in Kathmandu, we witnessed it,” a group of party members told the Post. It seems that President Rabi Lamichhane and Vice-president Swarnim Wagle are not in the same boat on how the party should function, they added.RSP acting spokesperson Manish Jha explains that it is the lack of synchronisation—rather than differences—between the leaders. “People from various schools of thought came together to form the RSP. It is true that we lack synchronisation, but it would be wrong to portray it as differences.”Another leader of the party said on condition of anonymity that the party has two schools of thought—one based on democratic principles and the other opposed to it.RSP acting general secretary Kabindra Burlakoti claims that the party is united.In conversations with the Post, representatives from Kathmandu Valley, Pokhara and Chitwan sounded more optimistic with the central leadership while those from remote areas were confused over their take on the party’s central leadership.The representatives from Madhesh were mild in their opinion about the leadership.Moreover, representatives were also not very positive about the way the central leadership is investing their energy to claim that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives.The probe panel, which submitted its report to the House of Representatives, has recommended the government prosecute Lamichhane, along with his former business partner GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai, board member of the media Kumar Ramtel and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi as per the prevailing laws. The inquiry committee, however, has said it couldn’t establish Lamichhane’s role in rerouting the cooperatives fund to Gorkha Media Network.“It would have been better had the central leadership waited to see how the government would take action,” the group of representatives from western Nepal told the Post. “In case Lamichhane is booked under the law, it could be counterproductive for the party in the long run.”The political campaign started by the RSP won’t get stalled even without Lamichhane, the representatives said, expressing their confidence in the party’s longevity.Lamichhane also presented a political report incorporating proposed statutory changes, the party’s commitments to voters, policy agenda presented by Swarnim Wagle at the Jaleshwar meeting and the conclusion drawn from the closed session of the national conference.Lamichhane’s report states that the policy paper presented in Jaleshwar defined ‘constitutional socialism’ as the party’s political ideology. Lamichhane also accuses the ruling Nepali Congress and CPN-UML of trying to lead the country to a two-party system by polarising smaller parties. “On the pretext of administrative reform, they are planning to wipe out the existence of small parties,” the report reads. “Potentially, this step can bring together new parties that want to be an alternative political force sooner or later.”Asked about RSP’s possible alliance with other parties, Burlakoti said though they are not in talks with the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), they are in regular contact with several independent candidates of last election.Asked if they are in discussion with Kathmandu Metropolitan City Mayor Balendra Shah, who won the 2022 local election independently, Burlakoti said: “Strategic moves are not to be disclosed.”However, when the national conference concluded after Lamichhane presented his report, representatives arriving from around the country were displeased.“This is not the way a party functions,” a representative told the Post, asking not to be named for fears of reprisal.When leaders put themselves at the centre and cadres in the periphery, the party’s downfall begins, another representative said. Acting General Secretary Burlakoti, however, defended the party leadership. “Our national conference was designed this way,” Burlakoti said. The report presented by the chair will be discussed in the party’s Mahakali-Mechi campaign that will start soon, he added.“At the national conference, we gave 5 percent of the total representatives (1500) time to speak, but those who spoke exceeded that number,” Burlakoti said.The conference, however, passed Lamichhane’s report. On Wednesday, Lamichhane announced the date of the party’s first general convention. It will be held on May 8-10 at a yet-undecided venue.“I would like to inform you that the Central Committee has become the general convention organising committee,” Burlakoti said. Lamichhane also announced the ‘Mahakali-Mechi Campaign’ to interact with the general public.In his report, Lamichhane has proposed a person not affiliated to any party to be elected the country’s president, directly elected executive head, or the prime minister. He also proposes giving the nation’s vice president the responsibility to chair the National Assembly.While the paper bats for a fully proportional electoral system, it says provincial assemblies cannot be accepted in the current shape.However, this does not mean the RSP is against the federal structure gained through the sacrifice of thousands of people, another representative said. “Our party has no strength to amend the constitution and scrap the federal structure. Therefore, for the time being, voices are growing among the party members about accepting the present political structure,” Khemraj Koirala, a conference representative from Kailali told the Post.Party members also suggested downsizing the number of ministers to make the provincial system functional, Koirala said.The report also stands for reducing the number of municipalities to less than 500, from the current 753. \nThe coalition government of the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress has reiterated its commitment to review the achievements made and weaknesses observed in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years.The two ruling parties have pledged to amend the constitution based on a broader understanding made through discussions, dialogues and consultations with political parties, civil society, intelligentsia, constitutional experts and the public.The parties have said such amendments will be made mainly based on the findings of the review and experiences of implementing it. Moreover, the parties said that establishing political stability in the country would be the major objective of the amendment.The two ruling parties made the commitments in the common minimum programme of the government, which was submitted to Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba on Wednesday evening. The parties had earlier formed a four-member panel to draft the government’s programme based on a seven-point agreement reached between the Congress and the UML in the first week of July. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Congress, and party deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the CPN-UML were tasked to prepare the document. They jointly submitted the document to the two party chiefs and made it public.“The achievements of the 2006 movement and the fundamental pillars of this constitution including federal, republic and inclusive governance system will be further institutionalised and strengthened,” the document says.The seven-page document is divided into eight subtitles—safeguarding national interest and independent foreign policy; protection, implementation and amendment of the constitution; good governance and quality service delivery; dynamic economy and development; ensuring social justice and fundamental rights; youth partnership; transitional justice, sustainable peace and social harmony; and miscellaneous.The coalition has pledged to set up a high-powered cooperative regulatory body as per the recommendation of the parliamentary inquiry committee to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector.“Taking action against those involved in misusing funds from cooperatives, the return of depositors’ money will be ensured,” the common minimum programme states.The ruling parties have pledged to punish corrupt people irrespective of the individuals’ power and positions. On the economic front, the coalition has vowed to expedite generation and transmission of hydroelectricity and further intensify the electrification process. \nThe erstwhile Pushpa Kamal Dahal government on April 12 constituted a committee led by Om Prakash Mishra, a former chief justice, to nominate candidates to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons. While the government picked four members for the committee, the fifth member is either the chairperson of the National Human Rights Commission or someone nominated by him. Initially, the commission had insisted that revision of the Enforced Disappearance Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act was a precondition for its participation in the committee, but following the Act’s amendment, it agreed to join the Mishra panel. However, three weeks after President Ramchandra Paudel authenticated the bill to amend the Act that the federal parliament endorsed, the constitutional human rights watchdog has yet to recommend its representative. Its officials said they are waiting for a formal request from the Ministry of Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs, as they expect a new letter in the changed context.“We have been told the ministry would send a new request letter for our representative, given the new context following the amendment to the Act,” said a commission member. The revised Act states that the recommendation committee has two months to make nominations for the chairpersons and members of the two commissions. It has already been five months since the Mishra-led panel was formed. However, a senior official at the law ministry said he does not think a new process needs to start just because the Act has been amended. “The two month countdown began the day the revised Act was enacted,” said the official. “I also don’t think the ministry told the commission that it would send a new request letter. If such a message was conveyed, it may have come from the political level.” Those involved in forging all-party consensus on the amendment say tensions between the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) have stalled the transitional justice process. Relations between the two parties have not been cordial ever since the formation of the new ruling alliance. The UML has consistently referred to the Maoist insurgency as ‘violence’, while the Maoist Centre has warned that the present KP Sharma Oli government could meet the same fate as Sheikh Hasina Wazed, the immediate past prime minister of Bangladesh.“The tussle between the two parties has directly affected the ongoing process,” one leader involved in the negotiations told the Post. “Oli doesn't seem as interested as he was earlier.”The committee was formed in May amid reservations from conflict-era victims of human rights violations and human rights defenders, who demanded that the Act be amended before selecting office bearers. The government, however, argued that forming the committee was necessary as per the Supreme Court’s March 12 order to the government to select office bearers for the two commissions within a month.The court had asked the government to constitute task forces within the commissions to conduct preliminary investigations into the victims’ complaints until the office bearers were appointed.Following the court’s order, the victims and human rights defenders demanded the government and the parties endorse the legal amendments by the top court’s deadline before starting the selection process. However, the amendment bill couldn’t be endorsed within the deadline, prompting the government to form a committee based on existing law.Following the committee’s formation, the victims and human rights defenders requested the government to halt the selection process until the Act was amended. They also urged the national rights watchdog to hold off on sending its representative.The two commissions have been defunct since July 2022, when the government decided to extend their terms without retaining their chairmen and members. The government claimed the bill to amend the transitional justice law would be endorsed by October 2022, and the appointments made based on the revised Act.But it took over two years for the federal parliament to endorse the bill. The victims and human rights defenders are closely watching who will be appointed to the commissions.The Truth Commission has received 63,718 complaints, while the commission on disappearances is sitting on around 2,400 cases. The new teams will have four years to accomplish their tasks, though there are provisions for their extension. The commissions that were formed in 2015 have done nothing other than collect complaints and conduct preliminary investigations on some of them.  \nRastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, addressing a two-day national conference of the party's central council that started on Tuesday, said that the emergence of the RSP has been a headache for Nepal’s traditional political parties.“Until we win a majority in the next election, their headache will continue,” Lamichhane said. “Some people think that if Rabi Lamichhane is defeated, then the role of RSP in national politics will shrink. However, with or without Rabi, RSP now will move ahead as a campaign.”At the national conference of central council members, all seven provincial committees presented their reports. In the process, some committees briefed the RSP on the financial difficulties they are facing to run their day-to-day activities, whereas others hinted at the challenges they are facing building the party organisation.Party’s Koshi provincial president Rajesh Timilsina said there are 25,000 RSP cadres in the province. Due to irregular levy payments from cadres, it had been difficult to run the party.“We now face the challenge in expanding the party’s membership base,” a party leader quoted Timilsina as saying. There were more people frustrated with the party’s activities than those attracted to it.Timilsina also called for a regular financial source to carry out party activities, the leader said.RSP provincial president for Madhesh Tapeshwar Yadav presented a report depicting the party in good light in the province. “If general elections were to be held now, our party would either lead the province or take the main opposition position,” a party insider told the Post, quoting Yadav.Achyut Lamichhane, the provincial chief of Bagmati, claimed that the leadership had expanded the membership in Chitwan and Kathmandu by 7,000 and 5,000, respectively.Party’s Lumbini committee chief Devraj Pathak, presenting the provincial report, said that a funds crunch had hampered the committee’s activities. In Karnali, the RSP is tackling geographical difficulties in welcoming more members to the party. Sudurpaschim party chief also briefed the leadership on the difficulties the provincial committee is facing in expanding the membership, the party leaders said.The financial report presented by RSP treasurer Lima Adhikari suggests that the party’s income totalled Rs34 million in the fiscal year 2023-2024. The amount includes membership fee, donations, sale of publicity materials, and interest on deposits, among other sources. According to RSP leaders, at least 50 representatives expressed their opinions in the ‘open session’ on Tuesday. They suggested that the leadership should be protected from external attacks, and the party chair should be allowed to form a team so as to ease the party’s operation.Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle presented a brief explanation on the ‘policy paper’ endorsed by the party’s Jaleshwar meeting last year.Acting General Secretary Kabindra Burlakoti presented a proposal for amending the party statute. Burlakoti proposes three vice-presidents and joint general secretaries, including a woman in each position.Apart from the treasurer and spokesperson, all the office bearers are also proposed to be directly elected.Though the party called its first national conference to discuss a wide array of issues, the report submitted by the parliamentary special probe committee on Monday dominated the discourse.The report on crisis-ridden cooperatives, submitted to the government via the Speaker of the House of Representatives, also concerns the fate of RSP President Rabi Lamichhane. Though the report does not directly implicate Lamichhane in the cooperatives fraud, it links him to the spending of the money illegally sourced from multiple cooperatives. The report also recommended prosecuting four individuals: Lamichhane, then-managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.Lamichhane also claims to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he sold after completing the legal procedure as he quit the television. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. Denying his involvement in the cooperatives scam, Lamichhane and other RSP lawmakers attacked the Nepali Congress for its repeated stance that led to the parliamentary committee’s formation.RSP leaders at the meeting tried to establish that Lamichhane had got a clean chit from the probe.Before concluding the conference on Wednesday, Lamichhane will present his political report. This conference is also expected to schedule the party’s first general convention for May next year. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rabi Lamichhane, the chairman of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), was involved in misusing millions of rupees received from cooperatives when he was the managing director of the now defunct Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report recommends that the government take action against former deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane for the act.Lamichhane was accused of diverting funds from multiple cooperatives to run the media company that operated the Galaxy 4K Television channel, which ceased operations last year. Chairman GB (Gitendra Babu) Rai and managing director Lamichhane co-founded and jointly ran the media company before Lamichhane joined politics in June 2022.“During our investigation, we found that the investment in the Gorkha Media Network had been made with the money diverted from various cooperatives,” Ishwari Devi Neupane, a Nepali Congress member of the probe committee, told the Post. “Although Lamichhane has been found guilty of using funds from cooperatives for Gorkha Media Network, it could not directly link him to the rerouting of cooperative funds.”Lamichhane has consistently denied any involvement in the misappropriation of cooperative funds. However, the report of the parliamentary special committee formed to investigate crisis-ridden cooperatives has concluded that Rs650 million from five credit cooperatives, including the Pokhara-based Surya Darshan Cooperative, Butwal-based Supreme Cooperatives, Chitwan-based Sahara Cooperatives, Birgunj-based Sano Paila Cooperatives, and Kathmandu-based Swarnalaxmi Cooperatives, were diverted to the Gorkha Media Network.The committee’s report, which was submitted to Speaker Devraj Ghimire at a meeting of the House of Representatives on Monday, recommends prosecuting four individuals, including Lamichhane, the then managing director of Gorkha Media Network; chairman Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai; a board member Kumar Ramtel; and initial founder Chhabi Lal Joshi.“Those in the roles of shareholders, board members and managing director can’t evade accountability and liability for the money that comes into the company,” reads the report submitted by the chair of the probe panel, CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa. It states that the bank account holders who operate the account should be responsible for how the money in that account is used. “Since Rai, Ramtel, Lamichhane and Joshi are seen to be using the money that came into the company from various cooperatives, we recommend that the Nepal government prosecute them in accordance with the prevailing laws,” the report further says. An Interpol diffusion notice has been issued against Rai, who has been on the run and is believed to be abroad. Ramtel is in judicial custody.The probe panel has also recommended that the government make binding legal arrangements for the payment for share purchases and sales. The report also suggests that the government make proper legal arrangements concerning sweat shares and prompt relevant agencies to address the matter. Lamichhane claimed to have held 15 percent of sweat shares in the company, which he said he sold after completing all legal procedures. However, the committee’s investigation found those claims to be false. “Forgery was involved in the purchase and sale of sweat shares,” Lekhnath Dahal, the CPN (Maoist Centre) lawmaker and committee member, told the Post. The report states that the office bearers of the media company had used forged documents while transferring the company’s shares, and recommends that the government carry out further investigation of the matter and take necessary actions.However, RSP leaders had their own interpretation of the probe committee’s report.RSP chair Lamichhane and Vice-chair Swarnim Wagle, while leaving the House meeting, claimed that the committee had acquitted Lamichhane of the allegations that he was involved in embezzlement of cooperative funds. They said they welcome the committee’s report, and noted that Shishir Khanal, the RSP member in the committee, did not even write a note of dissent “as the report had exonerated the party chair”.RSP leaders also claimed that the accusations from other parties had been proved false.Manish Jha, acting spokesperson of the RSP, said that even Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa had claimed that Lamichhane was directly involved in diverting cooperative funds to the media company using his own signature. Jha claimed that the report disproves this accusation. “We had acknowledged that Gorkha Media Network had diverted the cooperative funds for its operation, which the report confirms,” he added.“We had assumed the report might do great damage to our party, but we are pleased how it has been presented,” Jha told the Post. “Things will become clearer after the full report is made public.”But committee members don’t agree with the RSP leaders’ interpretation. “They may have assumed that their party chair would be directly implicated, but that did not happen,” said Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan, a Rastriya Prajantra Party (RPP) lawmaker and committee member. He said that not being directly implicated does not mean that he was not involved in the scam. “Our law does not permit the rerouting of the cooperative funds to a private company, yet Lamichhane and the company did exactly that. He can be prosecuted for this,” Pradhan, who is also a former chief of Nepal Police, told the Post.Legal experts say that Lamichhane could face prosecution under four different laws based on the findings of the parliamentary special inquiry committee’s report. “Lamichhane could be charged the cooperative fraud case under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering case under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act,” advocate Om Parkash Aryal told the Post.The committee was formed on May 28 and had four-point terms of reference to investigate cooperative funds embezzlement. Among the four-point ToR, the cooperatives linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The probe panel had three months to complete its work from the first day of the committee meeting which was held a week later after the committee’s formation. When the committee could not complete its task in the given time, Parliament had extended the term by 15 days, to September 22. But the committee has submitted its report before the expiry of the extended time. Speaker Devraj Ghimire forwarded the report to the government for implementation after committee chair Thapa submitted it to the House of Representatives on Monday.The lower house formed the special inquiry committee after the erstwhile main opposition party Nepali Congress obstructed House meetings continuously for weeks demanding the formation of such a panel.The Congress, along with the RPP, demanded a parliamentary special probe committee to investigate the cooperative embezzlement, claiming involvement of the then deputy prime minister and home minister Lamichhane. The then ruling parties the CPN (Maoist Centre), the major coalition partners UML and Lamichhne’s RSP were against the demand.Lamichhane, host of a popular television show, founded the RSP in June 2022. RSP is the fourth largest party in Parliament with 21 lawmakers (including deputy speaker).He is linked with multiple controversies. His case regarding the use of dual passports is sub judice. He was also stripped of his position as a lawmaker and minister for home affairs in early 2023 after he was found guilty of contesting the 2022 election without proper Nepali citizenship. Lamichhane had obtained an American green card, but contested the election in Chitwan-2 without first re-acquiring Nepali citizenship. He won by a huge margin. Lamichhane, who had been stripped of the lawmaker position on charges of using dual citizenship, got reelected as the lawmaker from the same constituency in a by-election held in 2023. Similarly, the parliamentary special probe committee has recommended that the government investigate Jyoti Gurung, former wife of Nepali Congress Vice President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung. Jyoti Gurung, who was a board member of Miteri Cooperative, is accused of mishandling more than Rs120 million of the cooperative’s funds. “The Miteri cooperative chairman, Khumbharaj Gurung, had complained to the committee about Dhan Raj Gurung and his wife over their mishandling of the cooperative's money,” Pradhan said. “So the committee report has recommended further investigation into the Gurungs.” On Friday, the special committee members visited the Miteri Cooperatives office at Mahalaxmisthan in Lalitpur, to discuss the matter with its chairman.After being charged with embezzling the cooperative’s funds, Congress Vice President Gurung, speaking in Parliament on September 10, called for a thorough probe to clear his name. Pradhan said the committee found no evidence implicating lawmaker Gurung in the misappropriation. Cooperatives are considered to be self-regulatory bodies, but in Nepal a large number of cooperatives are being operated arbitrarily by a handful of operators. The committee report also suggests that the government should establish a strong regulatory body to look after the financial aspect of cooperatives.Apart from chair Thapa the committee had six other members. Sarita Bhusal from the UML; Dilendra Prasad Badu and Ishwari Devi Neupane from the Congress; Lekhnath Dahal from Maoist Centre; Sishir Khanal from RSP and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan from RPP. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nThe 36th Asian Credit Supplementation Institution Confederation (ACSIC) conference concluded here on Monday, focusing on green finance and promoting SMEs, a critical trigger for meeting globally committed investments in achieving the SDGs.The 10th and final session participants discussed the 'Innovative Solutions: Financing for Nature’ theme.Green finance is a new financial pattern integrating environmental protection and economic profits.Babukaji Thapa, deputy general manager of the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), emphasised how Nepal's banks and financial institutions promote green finance, mainly focusing on agriculture and forest-based enterprises.According to him, ADB has been implementing three major projects related to green financing: Forest for Prosperity, Psychometric Prosperity, and Value Chain for Inclusive Agricultural Growth. “These projects are being carried out in collaboration with various donor agencies,” he said.Agriculture in Nepal is highly vulnerable to climate change. As a result, banks are hesitant to invest in forest-based and agriculture-related ventures. Thapa said that banks and financial institutions seek collateral to access loans, but many small farmers cannot provide it. “Besides, the lack of financial literacy among farmers makes it difficult for them to navigate the loan process.”“Nepal's forestry sector has a huge potential for economic growth. However, minimum investment and lack of favourable policy have hindered the realisation,” said Thapa.Nepal's Central Bank has imposed a mandatory requirement to finance the agriculture and energy sector. For example, commercial banks must provide at least 14 percent of their total credit to the agriculture sector by mid-July 2024 and 15 percent by mid-July 2025.They must provide at least 8 percent of their total credit to the energy sector by mid-July 2024 and 10 percent by mid-July 2025.Siddhant Pandey, CEO of Business Oxygen, IFC's SME Venture Fund, highlighted the innovative financial products currently implemented and practised in Nepal. He said that the growth in SMEs is transforming people's livelihoods in Nepal and has become a strong pillar in the national economy.He underscored the need for a paradigm shift in investment by implementing blended finance tools. Blended finance tools mix public and private funds to reduce risk and help attract more investment in high-risk projects.According to Pandey, blended finance is necessary because investors are more ready to take risks in such financing than investing in other tools.He also said that the provision of Viability Gap Funding (VGF) in Nepal needs to be properly implemented. “As a result, Nepal has been failing to attract investors.”He said Nepal should focus on green and resilient investment to achieve the SDGs and attain the zero carbon emission targets by 2045. He noted that renewable financing is complex in Nepal because investors are not assured of better returns. “Nepal needs some sort of policy intervention to promote green financing.”Natasha Kapil, Lead Private Sector Specialist at the World Bank, underscored the need to boost SMEs. In technology, Kapil highlighted the need to adopt energy-efficient technology. “The SMEs are playing an important role in the national ecosystem,” she Kapil, adding that modern technologies could increase their productivity.  \nHeifer International celebrated its 80th anniversary on Saturday in Nepal, marking its long-standing commitment as a nonprofit organisation dedicated to helping smallholder farmers end hunger and poverty in their communities.The milestone was commemorated in Kamalamai Municipality, Sindhuli, with the symbolic passing of 11 heifers from one farmer to another, embodying the organisation's “passing on the gift” philosophy.Heifer International has collaborated with the Nepal government on the Milky Way Project, which seeks to fully transform and modernise the nation’s dairy sector, thereby benefiting smallholder farmers and boosting the economy.In December 2022, Heifer facilitated the supply of 100 high-grade Holstein heifers and 8 Holstein bulls, donated by the government of Korea. The Milky Way Project aims to establish a “Model Dairy Village” in Kamalamai and expand its reach to benefit at least 500,000 families in the coming years.“The project exemplifies international cooperation and its potential to bring about meaningful societal change,” said Prakash Shrestha, the Bagmati provincial minister for agriculture and livestock development.“We are proud to be part of this initiative that is transforming the lives of our dairy farmers.” Heifer International CEO Surita Sandosham stated, “As we celebrate 80 years of Heifer International, we are reminded of the power of community and the profound impact of passing on the gift. This event in Kamalamai stands as a testament to the enduring spirit of generosity and the transformative power of our work.”Upendra Pokharel, mayor of Kamalamai Municipality, highlighted the project's success: “With the introduction of Korean cows, our monthly milk production has doubled from 27,000 litres last year to 55,000 litres this year.”Founded on 14 July 1944 by Dan West, Heifer International began with a shipment of 17 cattle from Alabama to Puerto Rico to help improve the lives of impoverished communities. The shipment of Korean Holsteins to Nepal in December 2022 and January 2023 continues this Heifer legacy.The “passing on the gift” ceremony is designed to promote a sense of community, solidarity, and shared purpose among farmers, fulfilling their responsibility as programme participants to help others improve their livelihoods, Heifer International explained.The Milky Way Project is already having significant positive effects on local communities, with increased milk production and improved economic conditions for participating families.Heifer International began its operations in Nepal in 1997, working alongside local farmers to enhance food security and reduce poverty by providing technical support to strengthen agricultural value chains, promoting environmentally friendly farming practices, and improving access to affordable inputs and services.Heifer Nepal has supported over 400,000 families and organised 277 agricultural cooperatives, all working under the Social Entrepreneur Women Alliance, an apex body led by progressive women farmers. \nAs many as 17 people, including children, have died, and 63 others have been infected with the Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon in June this year.Twenty-nine districts, including those in the Kathmandu Valley, have reported infection from the deadly virus, while 12 districts—Kailali, Kapilvastu, Palpa, Chitwan, Parsa, Rautahat, Sarlahi, Siraha, Dhanusha, Sindhuli, Jhapa and Sunsari—have reported deaths from the infection.“We have alerted agencies concerned to conduct awareness drives and implement other prevention measures in the districts where Japanese encephalitis infections or deaths have been reported,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division. “We have also requested various aid agencies, including the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunisation, to supply JE vaccine.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus, belonging to the same family as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The virus kills a third of those who fall ill and leaves up to half of those who survive with severe life-long disabilities, according to the UN health body.Officials say that September and October are the peak months for JE outbreaks.Health officials say this year’s death rate from the JE virus has exceeded 27 percent, and among the deceased, the number of children under 15 years of age is very high. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.The country started administering the vaccine doses in 2006, eight years before the World Health Organization officially issued prequalification certification, due to the high infection and deaths from the virus at the time. In 2005, JE killed nearly 2,000 people in Nepal—mostly children from the districts of Tarai region. In the first phase, all populations of the highly-affected four districts, Banke, Bardia, Dang, and Kailali, were inoculated with the JE vaccine. Later, the vaccination programme was expanded to 19 other affected districts, and children under 15 were inoculated.The government integrated the JE vaccine into the routine immunisation list in 2015. Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people still die, and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.Data from the Health Ministry show that less than 50 percent of the infected patients were found inoculated with the vaccine.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so treatment focuses on managing symptoms. However, safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent infection. Health officials said they are aware of the deadly disease outbreak and have already started consulting aid agencies for help to finance the JE vaccination programme.However, officials at the Department of Health Services said that none of the donors have taken health officials' requests seriously or shown interest in supporting the immunisation drive.Public health experts say that this is the right time to vaccinate all those at risk. Even if the vaccine does not help in outbreak management, it provides immunity from future infections. The JE virus is transmitted to humans through the bite of infected Culex mosquitoes. Pigs and ducks are considered natural reservoirs of the virus.Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths.An estimated 12.5 million people are thought to be at high risk of JE infection in Nepal. \nA few weeks ago a woman in her late 50s from Kathmandu visited a private hospital, seeking help for persistent abdominal pain and weakness. When doctors at the hospital could not diagnose her condition, she turned to another private hospital in Lalitpur.“Even there, doctors couldn't figure out her ailment in the general health checks,” said Kabin Maleku, executive director at Ask foundation, a non profit that provides free telemedicine services. “Doctors then carried out a blood test, which showed lead poisoning.”This has become a common refrain among hundreds of people across the country who have been affected by heavy metal poisoning from various sources, including from dietary foods, health supplements, and some ayurvedic medicines.Doctors attending the patient say that the actual cause of excessive lead levels in the blood of the woman is not known, though they suspect dietary supplements the woman has been using could be the main culprit.The acceptable limit for lead in the blood is 3.5 micrograms per deciliter(mcg/dl), but the woman’s levels had reached 65. Multiple doctors the Post talked to said that the number of people suffering from heavy metal has been rising of late. People often complain about severe abdominal pain, dehydration, diarrhoea, weakness, nausea, vomiting, and numbness in hands and feet, according to them. Doctors say high lead levels can cause anaemia, weakness, and damage to kidneys and brain. Mercury exposure may cause lung damage, and harm the brain and kidneys, while long-term exposure to arsenic is linked to skin disorders and increased risk of skin, bladder, and lung cancer. Prolonged exposure to cadmium can lead to kidney disease and weakened bones.“I have come across a few cases of heavy metal poisoning,” said Dr Kunjang Sherpa, a cardiologist at Bir Hospital. “More can be said once I get their reports, but it is clear that heavy metal poisoning in our country has been rising alarmingly of late.”Experts say people using dietary supplements for weight loss and those using Ayurvedic medicine from online shopping to manage blood sugar and blood pressure have been found to suffer from heavy metal poisoning, including of lead, arsenic, mercury and cadmium.Research has found that high levels of chemicals of heavy metals including lead, mercury, and arsenic, among others, have been found in certain dietary supplements and traditional health remedies.A study carried out by the Department of Ayurveda and Alternative Medicine under the Ministry of Health and Population in 2020 found toxic metals like arsenic, cadmium, lead, and mercury in three medicinal plants used in Ayurvedic treatments for common ailments.The study was carried out in three districts—Manang, Dhading and Parsa.The Department of Drug Administration, the national drug regulatory body, said it has banned the sale of dietary supplements in pharmacies. “Neither we grant permission to import nor do we allow sales from pharmacies,” said Pramod KC, spokesperson of the department. “If any are found selling, our drug inspectors confiscate them and take legal action.”Drug inspectors from the department have found unregistered dietary supplements and nutraceuticals in tablets, capsules, and liquid forms, as well as beauty ointments containing pharmaceutical ingredients being sold in wholesale and retail pharmacies. Such unapproved products could cause more harm than benefits, officials say.KC concedes that even with the ban on dietary supplements in pharmacies, doctors have been prescribing and patients have been using them.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, which issues import licences, says that it thoroughly checks product licences issued by relevant regulatory bodies in the country of origin before granting licences.“Dietary supplements are not intended for curative purposes and should not be prescribed by doctors,” said Mohan Shrestha, spokesperson at the department. “Dietitians can recommend supplements. We also have tested suspicious supplements in our own laboratory and taken action against those that failed to meet standards, but we have not yet found heavy metal poisoning yet.”Doctors say heavy metal poisoning from dietary supplements and other products, especially those related to Ayurveda and cosmetics, is not a new issue, but what concerns them much is the lack of antidotes for all toxic heavy metals in Nepal. \nThe mpox outbreak in Africa is still not under control, the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (Africa CDC) warned on Thursday, adding that cases were still increasing in several countries.The World Health Organization declared the recent outbreak of the disease a public health emergency of international concern after the new variant was identified.Countries in the continent are struggling to respond to another major outbreak coming at the heels of the COVID-19 pandemic that exposed weak health systems that were unprepared to deal with a major public health crisis.The number of mpox cases in Africa has surged 177%, and deaths have increased 38.5% compared with the same period a year ago, data from the Africa CDC showed.“We can say today that mpox is not under control in Africa. We still have this increase of cases that is worrying for all of us,” Jean Kaseya, director general of Africa CDC, told a weekly briefing on the outbreak.In one week 2,912 new cases were reported compared with the previous week including a new country, Morocco, where a case was reported, confirming the spread of the disease in all four regions of the continent.So far, 15 of the 55 member states of the African Union have reported cases, Africa CDC said.“We still have people dying from mpox in Africa. In one week, we lost 14 people,” Kaseya added.He added in some countries, such as Cameroon and the Democratic Republic of Congo, two strains of the disease were in circulation, but because surveillance and testing systems were not robust enough, it was impossible to tell if that was the case in other countries.Kaseya said Rwanda had started its vaccination campaign, while the Democratic Republic of Congo, the epicentre of the outbreak, is set to start vaccinations in early October. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nDefending champions Armed Police Force Club demolished Sudurpaschim Province 19-0 in the most lopsided win of the ANFA Women’s League at the ANFA Complex on Monday.Rashmi Kumari Ghising and Anita KC scored four goals each, while Preeti Rai netted a hat-trick for APF. Sabita Rana Magar and Kusum Khatiwada were at the double; and Anita Basnet, Saru Limbu and Renuka Hamal also found the net. APF’s one came from an own goal from Sudurpaschim’s Sumi Hangma Rai.The win also helped APF open up a six-point lead at the summit of the ten-team standings. APF have 22 points from eight matches. APF are also the team to score the highest number of goals in the league this season, with 46 goals to their name. They have conceded only two.APF’s 19-0 victory against Sudurpaschim is the biggest victory of the season so far. The previous biggest victory of the season was Army 14-0 success, also against Sudurpaschim.Winless Sudurpaschim have now conceded 65 goals in eight matches against their three goals scored (one each against Army, Waling and Bagmati Youth Club).They were also embarrassed 9-0 by Nepal Police Club, while their lowest margin loss came against Karnali Province when they suffered a 3-0 defeat.APF knew Sudurpaschim were the easiest target and took full advantage of it to go 11-0 up at half-time, with their three goals coming in the injury time. Their first-half goal rush also included an own goal from Rai in the 39th minute.Anita KC completed her hat-trick in the first half—her two goals came in the 45+2 and 45+3 minutes—and found her fourth goal in the 76th minute.Ghising, whose opening goal in the 8th minute opened the floodgates, accomplished a hat-trick two minutes into the second half and netted her fourth in the 76 minute. Ghising now leads the goal scoring chart with 13 goals.Waling Municipality’s Uganda forward Jackline Nassali is second in the list with seven goals.Preeti Rai, who found her first goal in the fourth minute of the first half injury time scored two freekicks in the 64th and 67th minute in a carbon copy fashion.Anita Basnet, Sabita Rana Magar and Saru Limbu all got on the scoresheet before the break.Kusum Khatiwada, who replaced Saru Limbu in the second half , scored twice in the 82nd minute and 86th minute, while Renuka Hamal also got on the score sheet in the 90th minute.Earlier, Chandrapur Municipality and Koshi Province shared points after playing a 1-1 draw, also at the ANFA Complex.Sunita Sunar put Chandrapur ahead in the 51st minute but Mamata Raut equalised in the 80th minute to snatch a draw for Koshi.The draw moved Chandrapur up to seventh position with eight points. Koshi stayed in fifth position with 11 points. \nNepali boxer Ramit Maharjan has bagged two gold medals at the IFMA Youth World Championship 2024, held in Bangkok, Thailand, on September 11-20.Maharjan,15, of Thecho in Godawari Municipality, secured the medals in Muay Thai in the J12-15 men’s 39-41 kg category. In the final, he defeated Seyed Matin Hosseini of the Eastern Mediterranean on a walkover. On September 19, Ramit won the second gold medal in Muay Talay.According to his trainer and father, Ram Maharjan, Ramit competed in the matches on September 17 and 19.Maharjan qualified at IFMA Youth World Championship 2023 held in Kemer Antalya, Turkey last year but couldn’t attend due to financial difficulties.On his return, a grand welcome was organised with a victory rally where the residents of Thecho, relatives and students of Saraswati Secondary School celebrated the victory. Nawa Durga Dhime Khala and Misa Dhime Khala of Thecho honoured him with traditional Newari instruments.Maharjan has won numerous gold medals in different national and international Muay Thai competitions.  \nSamjhana Lawati scored a double as Nepal Police Club defeated Waling Municipality 2-0 to maintain their unbeaten run in the ANFA Women’s League at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Saturday.The victory also helped Police close the gap with second-placed Tribhuvan Army Club in the table to one point after seventh round. Police have 15 points from four victories and three draws.Defending champions Armed Police Force Club, the only other unbeaten team in the league, lead the standings with 19 points.Waling stays in fourth position with 12 points and are firmly in the contention to progress to the Super League stage. The top five teams at the end of the single round robin league advance to the second round.Waling started the season with a 4-0 loss against Koshi Province but their Ugandan trio Jackline Nassali, Cissy Nantongo and Viola Namuddu have dramatically revived their campaign, making them one of the top contenders for the top five race.However, they were wasteful on Saturday despite being the better side in the first half.Waling’s first clean chance came in the 3rd minute when Sushma Tamang’s tight-angled effort found Nassali for a free header after hitting the crossbar but the Ugandan headed straight into goalkeeper Usha Nath.Sajina Koirala had a scoring opportunity in the 10th minute when a corner from Nantango found her unmarked inside the just outside of the six yard box but Koirala could not capitalise on it.And Police punished them with two second half goals.Lawati broke the deadlock in the 67th minute. After Niru Thapa slipped a ball to Lawati, she brilliantly executed a dummy to outsmart Waling defender Maya Maskey before crashing the ball into the net.Lawati then added her second and the winning goal in the first minute of the stoppage time after Maskey failed to clear a cross from 90th minute substitute Nirmala Upadhyaya. Owoeye shines for SankataLeague debutants Sankata Club also boosted their chance to progress to the next stage after they thrashed Sudurpaschim Province 6-0 earlier on the day at the same venue.Nigerian Temilope Jeniffer Owoeye found the net four times for Sankata, while Mamata Pun and Purnima Hamal also got to the scoresheet.Owoeye put Sankata in front in the fourth minute heading in a cross from Manisha Thapa Magar and doubled the lead in the 12th minute taking advantage of a miscommunication between Sudurpaschim goalkeeper Tikesori Saud and defender Manisha Okheda.The Nigerian completed her hat-trick in the 53rd minute with a brilliant solo effort.Pun added Sankata’s fourth after Manisha Thapa Magar put her through.Hamal extended Sankata’s lead three minutes later after Punam Chemjong set her up inside the box.Owoeye then wrapped up a comfortable victory from penalty in the fifth minute of the stoppage time after Shanti BK badly challenged her inside the box.It was winless Sudurpaschim’s seventh straight loss in the league. They have now conceded 46 goals against their three scored and sit at the bottom of the table.The win moved Sankata up to sixth position with eight points. \nIsrael’s military said it launched airstrikes against Hezbollah sites in Lebanon on Monday, which Lebanese authorities said had killed 492 people and sent tens of thousands fleeing for safety in the country’s deadliest day in decades.After some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire since hostilities flared in October, Israel warned people in Lebanon to evacuate areas where it said the armed movement was storing weapons.Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu sent a short video statement addressed to the Lebanese people. “Israel’s war is not with you, it’s with Hezbollah. For too long Hezbollah has been using you as human shields,” he said.Families from south Lebanon loaded cars, vans and trucks with belongings and people, sometimes multiple generations in one vehicle. As bombs rained down, children crammed onto parents’ laps and suitcases were tied to car roofs.Highways north were gridlocked. “I grabbed all the important papers and we got out. Strikes all around us. It was terrifying,” said Abed Afou, who was with his family, including three sons aged 6 to 13 and several other relatives. They sat in traffic as it crawled north.They did not know where they would stay, he said, but just wanted to reach Beirut.Some people escaped on foot. People carrying small bundles of belongings trekked northward on the beach near the Lebanese town of Tyre.Nasser Yassin, the Lebanese minister coordinating the crisis response, told Reuters 89 temporary shelters in schools and other facilities had been activated, with capacity for more than 26,000 people as civilians fled “Israeli atrocities”.After almost a year of war against Hamas in Gaza on its southern border, Israel is shifting its focus to the northern frontier, where Iran-backed Hezbollah has been firing rockets into Israel in support of Hamas, also backed by Iran.Israel’s military said it struck Hezbollah in Lebanon’s south, east and north, including “launchers, command posts and terrorist infrastructure.” The Israeli Air Force struck approximately 1,600 Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa Valley, it said.Lebanon’s health ministry said at least 492 people had been killed, including 35 children, and 1,645 wounded. One Lebanese official said it was Lebanon’s highest daily death toll from violence since the 1975-1990 civil war.The fighting has raised fears that the US, Israel’s close ally, and Iran will be sucked into a wider war.Saudi Arabia expressed deep concern on Monday and urged all parties to exercise restraint, state news agency SPA reported.A senior US State Department official said the United States does not support a cross-border escalation between Israel and Hezbollah and that Washington was going to discuss “concrete ideas” with allies and partners to prevent the war from broadening.Israeli officials have said the recent uptick in airstrikes on Hezbollah targets in Lebanon is designed to force the Iran-aligned group to agree to a diplomatic solution.The US official, briefing reporters in New York on condition of anonymity, pushed back on the Israeli position, saying the Biden administration was focused on “reducing tensions … and breaking the cycle of strike-counterstrike.”**CONFLICT ‘PEAK’**Israeli Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said Monday marked a “significant peak” in the nearly year-long conflict.“On this day we have taken out of order tens of thousands of rockets and precise munition. What Hezbollah has built over a period of 20 years since the second Lebanon War is in fact being destroyed by the IDF,” he said in a statement, referring to the Israel Defense Forces.On Monday evening Israel launched a strike on Beirut’s southern suburbs aimed at senior Hezbollah leader Ali Karaki, the head of the southern front. Hezbollah later said he was safe and had moved to a secure location.But Hamas’ armed wing said its field commander in southern Lebanon, Mahmoud al Nader, was killed in an Israeli air strike.Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a statement that Israeli strikes had hit long-range cruise missiles, heavyweight rockets, short-range rockets and explosive drones.In response, Hezbollah said it launched dozens of missiles at a military base in northern Israel.Sirens warning of Hezbollah rocket fire sounded across northern Israel, including in the port city of Haifa, and in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, the military said.About 60,000 people have been evacuated from northern Israel because of the cross-border fighting. Gallant said the campaign would continue until the residents had returned to their homes. Hezbollah for its part has vowed to fight until there is a ceasefire in Gaza.Hagari said Hezbollah put weaponry “inside Lebanese villages and civilian homes, and intended to fire them toward civilians in Israel while endangering the Lebanese civilian population.”Hezbollah has not commented on the assertion that it has hidden weapons in houses, which Reuters could not independently verify, but it has said it does not place military infrastructure near civilians.The strikes have redoubled the pressure on the group, which last week suffered heavy losses when thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies used by its members exploded.The operation was widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed nor denied responsibility.In New York, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said Israel wanted to drag the Middle East into a full-blown war by provoking Iran to join the Israel-Hezbollah conflict. “It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,” he told journalists after his arrival in New York to attend the U.N. General Assembly, saying the consequences of such instability would be irreversible. \nRepublican Donald Trump said that he will not make a fourth consecutive run for the US presidency if he loses the November 5 election, saying “that will be it” in an interview released on Sunday.Asked if he saw himself running again in four years if he is not successful in his third consecutive bid for the White House, the 78-year-old former president told Sharyl Attkisson’s “Full Measure” program: “No I don’t. I think that will be — that will be it. I don’t see that at all. Hopefully, we will be successful.”Trump faces a tight race against Democratic US Vice President Kamala Harris, with polls showing the two neck-and-neck in key battleground states that are likely to be decisive in determining the winner, even as Harris has begun to edge up in nationwide polls.Trump launched his first reelection bid for the 2020 election on the same day he was inaugurated in 2017 and announced his latest White House bid two years ago in November 2022.Trump has continued to falsely blame his 2020 loss to Democratic President Joe Biden on widespread voter fraud and faces federal and state criminal charges over efforts to overturn the election results. He denies any wrongdoing and has cast his indictments as a political attack against him while embracing increasingly dystopian rhetoric if he were to lose in 2024.He has also launched a number of business ventures amid his latest campaign, including Trump Media, NFTs, and Trump-branded sneakers, coins and crypto.Harris, 59, meanwhile, has cast the race as a critical moment for US democracy even as she seeks to focus on kitchen-table issues such as costs for families and housing.Asked whether the four-year break helped him regroup and figure out who he could trust as allies, Trump said: “It would have been easier if I did it ... contiguous.”“But the benefit is more than anything else, it shows how bad they were,” he added.Trump, who spoke with Attkisson at his Florida resort, also said it was “too early” to make deals with people for any position in his White House cabinet should he win in November. \nIsraeli army spokesperson Avichay Adraee said on Monday that airstrikes on houses in Lebanon in which “Hezbollah hid weapons” are imminent, as the defence minister said attacks on the armed group would deepen, calling on Israelis to show composure.Earlier, residents of southern Lebanon received calls from a Lebanese number ordering them to immediately distance themselves 1,000 metres (3,280 feet) from any post used by Hezbollah, a Reuters reporter in the south, who received the call, said.In a televised statement earlier, the Israeli military spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari issued a similar warning and said it was being “distributed in Arabic on all networks and platforms in Lebanon.”The Israeli military, meanwhile, launched its most widespread wave of airstrikes against Iran-backed Hezbollah in nearly a year of conflict, simultaneously targeting Lebanon’s south, eastern Bekaa Valley and the northern region near Syria.Asked by reporters about a possible Israeli ground incursion into Lebanon, Hagari said “We will do whatever is needed” in order to return evacuated residents of northern Israel to their homes safely, a war priority for the Israeli government.The latest attacks came amid some of the heaviest cross-border exchanges of fire in a conflict raging alongside the war between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.Hagari said that Hezbollah over the years has stashed weapons, including cruise missiles, in houses and buildings throughout southern Lebanon, and called on residents to stay away from these sites.Hagari presented in a media briefing an aerial video of what he described as Hezbollah operatives trying to launch cruise missiles from a civilian house in Lebanon and the subsequent Israeli strike moments before it was launched.“Hezbollah is endangering you. Endangering you and your families,” Hagari said. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nThe political rhetoric on Nepal’s development ambitions is high decibel. Yet, for decades since the first generation of economic reforms began in the early 90s, Nepal’s grand economic plans have been hobbled by the absence of humble but sustained actions—falling behind regional peers. The regulatory environment has failed to keep up with developments in both richer and emerging economies. The Maoist movement and protracted political instability eroded early progress. However, even after the promulgation of the new constitution in 2015, the same issues continue to affect Nepal’s ability to attract and sustain varied sources of financing to meet its development needs—despite regularly organising numerous summits meant to attract foreign investments.In 2024 alone, Nepal held two high-powered summits to convene investors: The Investment Summit and the Infrastructure Summit. However, foreign investors’ attendance is dwindling in each successive edition of these summits. The reason is simple: There is no walking the talk, and existing foreign investors in the country continue to face significant hurdles in getting investment products approved despite the promise of seamless processing under the rhetoric of a ‘one-stop-shop.’ And their experience deters new investors.A rent-seeking mindset, coupled with bureaucratic illiberalism, is one of the biggest obstacles. In addition, given the largely left orientation, the country has an inherent anti-private sector mindset. From consumers and civil servants to journalists and civil society, everyone likes to take a dig at the profiteering private sector. The word ‘cartel’ is excessively used in describing the private sector. That bias extends among many politicians too—and manifests in different forms of constraints.Profit incentivises private individuals and firms to take risks and become first movers to cash in on the immense risk-to-reward potential. The private sector is the backbone of the Nepali economy, which contributes to over 80 percent of the GDP, according to the State of Private Sector Report 2023, a joint publication by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industries (FNCCI). That is significant. Clearly, the private sector will continue to play a critical role in meeting Nepal’s development goals. To unlock its full potential, there needs to be a shift toward more consistent and transparent policies that foster investor confidence.Nepal is grappling with significant financing gaps across multiple key sectors. By 2030, the country will require an estimated $20 billion for energy development, $10 billion for infrastructure and additional billions for healthcare, education and tourism. The annual investment deficits are mounting and are quite substantial. Traditional funding sources, such as government allocations and foreign aid, are insufficient to meet these demands. To bridge this considerable gap, Nepal needs to explore alternative financial instruments like hybrid financing, private equity and venture capital, in addition to public-private partnerships (PPPs).Alternative financingWith over $100 million in investments, funds such as Dolma Impact Fund, Business Oxygen (Bo2), One to Watch, True North Associates, Global Equity Fund and Prabhu Capital have demonstrated the potential for alternative financing in Nepal. Dolma has invested in sectors ranging from renewable energy to healthcare and technology, raising significant capital from international investors. The fund has made several successful exits, including in the renewable energy sector, showcasing the viability of private investment in the country. Bo2 has also facilitated investments in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), highlighting how both domestic and foreign capital can achieve profitable exits in Nepal.In addition to traditional private equity and venture capital, the non-resident Nepali (NRN) community represents an untapped resource for alternative financing. NRNs are well-positioned to contribute to development not only through remittances but also by participating in innovative financial instruments like hybrid financing and bonds.Since their genesis in the United States in the 80s, hybrid or mezzanine financing instruments (HFI) have become widely prevalent in emerging markets. These instruments blend elements of both loans and equity. Investors and borrowers appreciate hybrid financing tools because they offer a range of options and adaptability. For example, a lender might provide a loan with a lower fixed interest rate and receive a share of the borrower’s profits. Regulatory constraintsWhile HFIs offer tremendous potential, Nepal’s regulatory framework has not yet been adapted to accommodate these innovative investment structures. HFIs are widely used in other emerging markets like India and Thailand, allowing investors to ‘hedge their risks’ while providing companies with more flexible financing options.Nepal has clear legal provisions for approving foreign investments in pure equity or straight debt form. Equity investments often involve ordinary or preference shares, while debt financing includes term loans and syndicated financing. However, there are currently no legal provisions for hybrid financing instruments that combine features of both equity and debt.A first-of-a-kind HFI commitment by an international financial institution to a local energy company to finance hydropower has been sitting at the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) for nearly a year now. This situation highlights the need for a more dynamic regulatory environment that can accommodate the evolving needs of both investors and borrowers while easing requirements for exits for equity investors. Under Nepal’s Foreign Investment and Loan Management Bylaw 2078, all foreign loans require NRB approval, and there are caps on interest rates that can be charged. While these regulations aim to protect national interests, they often have the unintended consequence of discouraging foreign capital.Approval of this innovative financing structure would open doors for more investments by foreign investors into Nepali startups ready for scaling up, benefiting many companies in need of financing. To remain competitive in attracting foreign investment, Nepal must focus on making its regulatory environment more accommodating while building a bureaucratic structure that is fit for purpose. Nepal’s financing gap cannot be closed by rhetoric alone. Summits and political speeches can only go so far. Proactive policy reforms, along with clear and consistent implementation are essential to attract the capital needed for large-scale development projects. Legal reforms that enable faster and more flexible approval processes, especially for hybrid financing instruments, are crucial for Nepal to achieve its development goals by 2030. \nNearly two and a half decades ago, I observed a considerable annual number of patients with Japanese encephalitis at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital (STIDH). Many lost their lives due to complications resulting from the delay in hospital admission. The infections were primarily from the Tarai region, where outbreaks commonly occur during the monsoon. This year, too, there has been a significant resurgence of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal, with 14 patients reportedly succumbing to the illness since the start of the monsoon in June. Fatalities have already doubled the number observed in the last year, and the laboratory-confirmed cases are more than 60. It can be easily assumed that the number of asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic cases could be in the thousands because Nepalis tend to avoid seeking medical attention until the disease presents severe symptoms. Therefore, the chances of determining the actual number of cases and geographical trends are slim.This scenario raises critical questions: Is Kathmandu at a high risk of the virus? Despite the inclusion of the vaccine in the childhood immunisation programme, are individuals who did not receive the vaccine or those who were jabbed many years ago (no booster dose received) in danger? Japanese encephalitis is a mosquito-borne \"flavivirus\" from the same genus as the dengue virus. It is transmitted to humans through the bite of Culex species mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organisation, nearly one hundred thousand symptomatic cases are reported annually in Asia. Its mortality rate can reach up to 30 percent, making it a highly lethal infection. Even after treatment, up to 50 percent of those infected may experience long-term effects on the nervous system. Notably, children under 15 are particularly vulnerable to this virus. In most cases, the symptoms of the infected are either mild or not visible at all. One out of 250 infected individuals may experience severe symptoms, with complex issues in the nervous system. There is a strong seasonal pattern of Japanese encephalitis in Nepal, beginning in June-July, peaking in August and declining by October. This means that more cases are observed during the monsoon season. Thus, the ongoing outbreak in Nepal is expected to last for several weeks (at least more than four weeks), which means that deaths attributed to this virus could rise unless immediate and effective interventions, such as vaccine and awareness campaigns, are initiated. Symptoms begin to appear between four and 14 days after infection. These include high fever, headache, stiff neck, confusion/ambiguity, muscle stiffness/cramping, loss of consciousness, and, potentially, death in delayed treatment. No specific antiviral drugs are available for the virus. Treatment is based on the symptoms and complications. However, a vaccine against it has played a key role in curbing severe Japanese encephalitis that was once widespread. The sudden and unusual reemergence of Japanese encephalitis suggests that a special vaccination campaign should be launched in high-risk areas as early as possible. Unfortunately, we have been focusing only on counting the number of patients and waiting for the end of virus season. Similar conditions have also been observed with dengue virus.A study (conducted between 2007 and 2015) published in 2017 in the journal PLoS One, revealed that individuals over 25 are equally susceptible to infection and/or even have higher death rates than other age groups. Moreover, the study also showed a notable trend of Japanese encephalitis moving from the Tarai region to Hilly (including Kathmandu) and mountainous regions of Nepal. So, it is necessary to integrate all age groups in the immunisation programmes and extend them to the hilly and mountain regions. The essential consideration is assessing the likelihood of an outbreak akin to the one in the Tarai region occurring in Kathmandu, given the city’s high population density and limited awareness regarding the virus. Several studies have shown that a range of infections/vector-borne diseases, previously restricted to the Tarai region, are now reaching the hilly and mountainous regions. Dengue is a prominent example of how vector-borne disease can migrate from the Tarai to the hills. Moreover, a study published in The American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene in 2007 revealed that 75 percent of infected individuals had no history of travel outside Kathmandu, indicating that the Japanese encephalitis virus might have been circulating or even well-established in Kathmandu long before. The presence of Japanese encephalitis in Kathmandu is alarming and demands urgent consideration. The possibility of a \"surprise outbreak\" of this virus cannot be overlooked due to easy access to transportation, climate change, rapid urban growth/increased population density and the environment favouring mosquito breeding. We should not forget that dengue was once considered a disease that only appeared in Tarai, as it maintained its presence there for a prolonged time. Nonetheless, in 2022, 18 years since its identification, Kathmandu experienced an unprecedented and deadly outbreak that resulted in the deaths of at least 88 individuals within a short span.       \nAs the Nepali Congress chief whip in Parliament, Ramesh Lekhak was among the most vocal advocates for the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the irregularities in the cooperatives sector, with a particular focus on Gorkha Media Network. This was less than three months ago when the Congress was the main opposition. There had at the time been widespread media reporting on how the network chairman, GB Rai, and Managing Director, Rabi Lamichhane, had been involved in embezzling money from cooperatives and pumping it into the network’s Galaxy 4K television. The matter was urgent as Lamichhane was the serving deputy prime minister and home minister. Credible evidence had surfaced of the home minister trying to suppress police investigation into his personal involvement in the scam. Partly as a result of the relentless pressure from the likes of Lekhak and his party, such a committee indeed came into being on May 28. The same committee has now presented reams of evidence showing how Lamichhane misused money illegally brought into the network from various cooperatives. Lekhak, who has replaced Lamichhane as home minister, now has the chance to walk the talk and implement the recommendations of the parliamentary probe committee he so earnestly championed. Lamichhane and his Rastriya Swatantra Party colleagues rather curiously claim that the party chair has been given a ‘clean cheat’ by the probe committee. Far from it. It has instead held him responsible for the gross misuse of his office of the Gorkha Media Network’s Managing Director. Additionally, the committee has presented clear evidence of how Lamichhane used forged documents to undertake various financial deals while serving as the network’s MD. This is also an untenable premise considering that people in similar positions have been prosecuted. For instance, Gita Basnet, a parliamentarian from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, is on the run after the police filed a case against her. Basnet was held responsible for misusing the money of Nawalpur-based Chhipchhipe Cooperative, the money which had been invested in a resort she was operating. Interestingly, she was held responsible even though it was not her but her brother-in-law who had brought the money into the organisation. By comparison, the case against Lamichhane is more straightforward. Besides evidence of funds misuse, there is also paper evidence of millions of rupees being deposited into his personal bank account from the account of a cooperative. Legal experts say there is enough evidence to book Lamichhane for cooperative fraud under Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime under the Organised Crime Prevention Act and money laundering under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act.This is not a question of exacting revenge against a political opponent, as some RSP leaders have tried to paint the case against Lamichhane. For Home Minister Lekhak and the administration, it is rather a matter of applying the law fairly. The government is already pursuing action against the other individuals who had been accused alongside Lamichhane in the same case. While a diffusion notice has been issued against GB Rai, others are in judicial custody. Lamichhane has thus far been let off the hook because of his political manoeuvrings. Now that the Cabinet has given Lekhakh the green signal to press ahead, he should diligently pursue the case to its end. How he pursues the culprits flagged by the parliamentary committee in the cooperatives scam, including Lamichhane, will define his success or failure as home minister.  \nNepal is marking the ninth Constitution Day on Thursday. While the government is preparing to celebrate with special functions, a few Madhesh-based parties want to mark it as a Black Day. The Loktantrik Samajbadi Party is one of the disgruntled groups that has announced a protest on the occasion. But the Janamat Party, a new force that is leading the provincial government in Madhesh, has decided to celebrate the day. A document of compromise, multiple forces, including the Madhesh-based parties, have grievances over the present constitution. The CPN (Maoist Centre) registered its dissenting views on various issues at the time of drafting the constitution, including on the form of government. They stood for a directly elected presidential system and agreed to a compromise deal with other parties. The Rastriya Prajatantra Party, which lobbies for a Hindu kingdom, was against the secular republican system. The pro-monarchy party has frequently launched agitations demanding the same. A fringe Rastriya Janamorcha party has stood against federalism right from the start. Various other parties and groups oppose one or the other constitutional provision. But they haven’t taken an extreme decision to mark the day of its promulgation as a black day.It’s universally accepted that no constitution is perfect and a statute cannot satisfy all sections of the society. It is hence said that a constitution is a living document that can be amended and updated based on people’s aspirations and the changed reality. Nepal’s constitution and political forces of the country have accepted these facts. The major political forces at the time of unveiling the constitution in 2015 promised the disgruntled groups that they would address some of their ‘genuine concerns’ through amendments. They have a moral responsibility to keep their word. After its promulgation, the statute has been amended multiple times. Going against the usual parliamentary practice of one of the two largest parties forming the government and the other leading the opposition bloc in the House, Nepal’s two largest forces—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—are now together in government. The given rationale for their coming together is to amend the constitution and ensure political stability. Again, it is incumbent upon them to do so based on broadest possible consultations. Registering differences, pressing the establishment to get their demands addressed and peacefully fighting for the cause they believe is a democratic right of each and every Nepali. But the manner of the protest matters. The parties and the leaders that have joined governments and governed the country multiple times, both before and after the promulgation of the constitution, should present themselves in a more mature way. It smacks of hypocrisy when they say and do one thing when in the government and the complete opposite when out of power. More importantly, people should be convinced the agendas and demands of political forces are genuine. It is unfortunate that over the past decade, people have come to believe that the Madhesh-based parties are more than willing to trade their agenda for Cabinet seats.
