Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to force through a vote of trust on Monday despite protests from the main opposition, the Nepali Congress, has further deepened the divide in Nepali politics.The ruling coalition and the opposition parties are already in a bitter disagreement over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe the alleged involvement of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the misuse of cooperative funds.According to leaders from both ruling and opposition parties, the manner in which the floor test was conducted in the House of Representatives on Monday is unlikely to ease tensions soon. The rancour is expected to continue until at least the budget announcement day on May 28.If the Congress and five other opposition parties continue to obstruct the House, the government could bring the budget through an ordinance or by using marshals in the same manner Prime Minister Dahal sought a vote of confidence on Monday, say political observers. Amid sloganeering and protest by Congress lawmakers on Monday, Speaker Devraj Ghimire deployed marshals to allow the prime minister to seek a vote of confidence. Soon after Speaker Ghimire announced the commencement of House proceedings, Congress lawmakers surrounded the well and chanted slogans demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the home minister’s alleged involvement in the cooperatives scam. The prime minister then rushed to the rostrum and started speaking, seeking a vote of confidence, and even threatening the Congress of consequences for trying to disrupt the proceedings.“I think you [Nepali Congress] have made a big mistake today. I am that prime minister, who, time and again, helped you in the past, who is working to bring you into the dialogue and consensus. But today, you have set a bad example by preventing that prime minister from seeking a constitutionally-mandated vote of confidence, and I express my deep sadness at your move. This will cost you dearly,” the prime minister said while asking lawmakers to extend their trust in him. The prime minister received 157 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. One member abstained, while none voted against the motion. This was his fourth vote of trust after being elected to the post of prime minister in December 2022.When asked by reporters what he meant by the cost for the Congress, the prime minister said the Congress will face the consequences in the next general elections.After the prime minister secured the vote of confidence despite the opposition’s protest, Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, raised serious questions about the conduct of Speaker Ghimire. “The Speaker fortified the House like a barrack and allowed the prime minister to seek a vote of trust, which is a joke in parliamentary democracy,” said Lekhak, adding “The Speaker acted like a loyal party worker.”“Today, the Speaker did not allow the opposition party to speak in Parliament. It is because of the arrogance of the parliamentary majority. This is a tyranny and clearly shows the government’s disregard for parliamentary democracy,” said Lekhak.A Nepali Congress office-bearer said the party would harden its position in the coming days and unite all opposition parties against the government. According to a statement issued by the party, the Congress has called for a joint meeting of its central working committee and parliamentary party for Wednesday to discuss the latest political situation and chart out a future course.“Did you forget who brought you into the peaceful politics from the jungle?” Lekhak asked the prime minister in response to the prime minister’s statement that Congress has to pay a huge price.“When you took up arms to change the regime, who brought you to the peace process? Please stop making such irresponsible statements…what irresponsible utterances are you making? The Nepali Congress has to pay the price—what price?” a visibly angry Lekhak said.The Congress has been obstructing the House of Representatives seeking the formation of a parliamentary probe committee against Home Minister Lamichhane. After repeated meetings and backdoor negotiations, the ruling and opposition parties on Saturday agreed to form a parliamentary committee but differed over its terms of reference (ToR). The ruling and opposition parties also formed a task force to fix the committee’s terms of reference, but despite hectic negotiations throughout Sunday, they failed to reach an understanding. The Congress and other opposition parties were demanding that the parliamentary committee should probe the home minister. But the biggest party in the ruling coalition, CPN-UML, and Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, have been dismissing the demand for an exclusive probe into the home minister. On Sunday, the opposition parties, who are now united under the leadership of the Congress, allowed the home minister to speak in the House, something Lamichhane had long been asking for. Lamichhane, while addressing the House, made many unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders. Following Lamichhane’s statement, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa organised a press conference and challenged the home minister to prove the accusations levelled against him and the Congress party. The accusations and counter-accusations between the Congress and Lamichhane have greatly diminished the chances of forming a parliamentary committee.Lekhak said after the parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Monday morning, the party had decided to draw the prime minister’s attention to Lamichhane’s ‘unjustified’ statement in the House. He accused the home minister of trying to evade the probe and said the accusations Lamichhane made in the House should be taken seriously. “The home minister was uncivilised and violent during his statement,” said Lekhak. Even a ruling party questioned the need for a trust vote at a time when the main opposition had been staging protests inside the House.“We gave a vote of trust to the prime minister as we are still in the government. But we wonder why the prime minister was in such a rush to seek a vote of confidence,” said Rajendra Pandey of the CPN (Unified Socialist). The prime minister had decided to seek a vote of confidence after the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, one of the parties backing the government, withdrew its support last week. The prime minister can seek a vote of confidence within 30 days after a ruling partner party withdraws support. Besides Thapa, Lamichhane’s accusation was challenged by Nepali Congress Vice-president Dhan Raj Gurung, and chairman of the Rastriya Janamorcha, Chitra Bahadur KC. Gurung has registered a complaint with Speaker Ghimire and asked for action against Lamichhane for ‘contempt of a parliamentarian’. Lamichhane had accused Gurung of misusing a diplomatic passport. But Gurung said the Supreme Court had already given him a clean chit in the case of his alleged misuse of a diplomatic passport.More opposition parties joined the protest led by Congress in Parliament on Monday. “Speaker Ghimire did not present himself like a Speaker,” said Gyan Bahadur Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. “He acted more like a UML cadre. He has failed to perform his duty as Speaker.”“The Speaker made a blunder today by ignoring the Congress and other opposition parties who had rejected the trust vote. The Speaker acted with such force for the first time in Nepal’s parliamentary history,” said Shahi. Dahal had opted for a floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023, getting 268 votes. The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time three months later, after breaking ties with the UML and forging a new alliance with the Congress. This time, he secured the support of 172 lawmakers. He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after the Congress withdrew its support to the government. Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the UML and other parties on March 4, to this time get 157 votes.Chief Whip of the UML Mahesh Bartula said that following its rowdy showing in the House on Monday, the Congress should stop calling itself a democratic party. “The anti-democratic nature of the Nepali Congress has been exposed today,” said Bartula. “It has now lost the right to call itself a democratic party.” \nIn his address to Parliament on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane failed to clarify whether he was involved in the cooperatives fund misappropriation as accused by the main opposition party, the Nepali Congress, experts say.Instead of presenting any convincing evidence to prove the allegations wrong, Lamichhane tried to label counter-accusations against his accusers, they said.Congress has been obstructing Parliament proceedings since Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed the coalition partners on March 4 by breaking alliance with the Nepali Congress and bringing the CPN-UML onboard. Congress has been obstructing Parliament for the last two months, demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to probe Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of cooperatives funds.Lamichhane and his former business partner, GB Rai, who has fled the country after the cooperatives controversy surfaced, are accused of rerouting the money from various cooperatives in Pokhara, Butwal and Chitwan to Gorkha Media Network to jointly run Galaxy 4k Television, which is now dysfunctional.Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), had been seeking time to defend himself in the Parliament after Congress demanded that a parliamentary committee be formed to probe his involvement in the scam. Though he got the opportunity to speak after insisting on it for two months, experts say he failed to defend himself.In his speech, Lamichhane could not provide a clear answer as to why he wasn’t involved in the misappropriation of the cooperative funds, they say, adding that instead of addressing the questions raised against him, he raised other issues that would not prove him innocent.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary of Parliament, said that Lamichhane was given the platform to clarify the charges against him but he couldn’t utilise that.“A programme presenter in television before joining politics in 2022, he definitely should have known what he was supposed to tell while addressing Parliament,” Thapa told the Post. “But, instead of answering the questions earnestly, he tried to ‘do politics’.”During his about 40-minute-long address in Parliament, Lamichhane fiercely attacked the Congress party and its leaders, accusing them of being involved in various scandals. Lamichhane particularly took aim at Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and other senior party leaders.In doing so, experts say, Lamichhane took the ‘whataboutery’ approach, which is a technique of responding to accusations or difficult questions by deflecting attention through counter-accusations or raising unrelated issues.Earlier, when he was questioned about his passport and citizenship, he had presented himself as flamboyantly as he did on Sunday. Last year in February, he lashed out at the media after he had to step down as the home minister. This time, he targeted leaders of the main opposition party.Political analyst Mumaram Khanal found the way Lamichhane presented himself in the Parliament something odd. The way he spoke is seldom expected in Parliament, said Khanal.“In parliamentary practice, the House always belongs to the opposition party, whereas the ruling parties are supposed to answer the queries they raise,” Khanal told the Post. “Lamichhane was supposed to answer the questions raised against him but he ended up being a reactionary, raising counter questions.”However, RSP leaders are not ready to accept Khanal’s argument. “Lamichhane just cited the earlier instances that had happened in Nepal, which cannot be undermined by labelling him reactionary,” Shiva Nepali, a RSP lawmaker, told the Post.Lawmaker Nepali claimed that Lamichhane was able to clarify the allegations against him. “The common citizens do not understand the political language, so he used the language they understand,” Nepali said.Meanwhile, Congress Vice President and Member of Parliament Dhan Raj Gurung submitted an application to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Monday demanding action against Lamichhane for disrespecting Parliament.Gurung demanded that Home Minister Lamichhane be made accountable for contempt of Parliament for his baseless allegation against Congress lawmakers.“As per the regulation of Parliament under Rule 219, Home Minister Lamichhane failed to abide by the rules of Parliament,” Gurung said in his application.Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress has concluded that Lamichhane presented himself “in a violent manner” in Parliament on Sunday.Congress leaders on Monday condemned Lamichhane's presentation in the House of Representatives as rude, misleading, fabricated, and violent. Lamichhane, however, argued that he had done nothing wrong, citing past instances while addressing the House on Sunday. Speaking to the media at the Parliament premises on Monday, Lamichhane clarified that during his remarks, he merely cited media reports that named individuals in various cases in the past. \nLack of irrigation has forced farmers in Lumbini province to abandon the farming of spring paddy, one of the major sources of food grain.However, most farmers have switched to maize, as the use of superior hybrid seeds has boosted production and earnings compared to spring paddy.The area growing spring paddy (known as chaite dhan in Nepali) has been on a declining trend nationwide as the government has failed to keep its promises.The government had planned to expand the acreage of spring paddy by 200,000 hectares to 300,000 hectares in a bid to increase output and make the country self-reliant in food grain.Nepal has 1.44 million hectares of land suitable for growing paddy. However, spring paddy is grown on only 104,712 hectares.Spring paddy is planted in 35 districts between mid-March and mid-April. Plantation of this crop, however, is not common because it requires better irrigation. As a result, most cultivators prefer to grow paddy during summer when there is abundant rain. Despite low acreage, productivity of spring paddy is high, with harvests standing at 4.98 tonnes per hectare, as against 3.97 tonnes for regular summer paddy.In Lumbini province, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,038 hectares last fiscal year, which has shrunk to 2,677 hectares in the current fiscal year. Bardiya, one of the top spring paddy-producing districts in Lumbini province, has seen the area shrink to 1,201 hectares from 1,450 hectares in the last fiscal year.Except for Rolpa and Rukum, spring paddy is cultivated in all districts of Lumbini province. Spring paddy production areas in Palpa have dwindled to 630 hectares this fiscal year from 700 hectares last year. The area in Gulmi has been reduced to 319 hectares from 340 hectares.In Arghakhanchi, the area has declined to 170 hectares from 200 hectares last year. The area in Rupandehi has declined to 54 hectares from 60 hectares in the last fiscal year, and the Kapilvastu spring paddy-producing area has halved to five hectares this fiscal year.According to the Lumbini Province Agriculture Development Directorate, however, the area under spring paddy in some districts has increased marginally.It has increased from 40 hectares to 55 hectares in Pyuthan and from 5 hectares to 7 hectares in Nawalparasi.Similarly, in Dang, the spring paddy area increased marginally to 200 hectares from 198 hectares. In Banke, it has increased to 36 hectares from 35 hectares.According to government officials, in the 10 districts of Lumbini province, Chaite-2, Chaite-4, Chaite-6, Hardinath-I, and Bindeshwari are some of the paddy varieties planted during the spring.“The decline in the production area is mainly due to the lack of farm hands in the villages,” said Ram Prasad Pandey, chief of Lumbini Province Agriculture Development Directorate.“As there is no attraction in farming, it has prompted a massive out-migration. Youths are leaving their hometowns to better jobs abroad in droves.”He said that in southern Tarai, the cost of production of spring paddy is high as most farmers irrigate their land using electric pumps.Similarly, experts say that spring paddy is not the choice for consumption, particularly in urban areas, due to its large and thick grain. The demand for fine and long-grain rice varieties, however, has been increasing exponentially. But these varieties are not produced on a commercial scale in Nepal.Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Kaligandaki, Badikhola, Ridi Khola, Mathura and other areas were once popular for spring paddy as the terraced fields used to be covered with paddy during the March-May period. The youth from the hills are either leaving Nepal or to bigger cities in the country. As earnings from other professions are higher compared to agriculture, experts say the future of farming in western Nepal looks bleak. As spring paddy farming has been declining, the provincial government has been conducting programmes to attract the farmers. The decline in spring paddy area is mainly due to a lack of sufficient irrigation. The existing irrigation projects are out of order, and farmers cannot afford the repair and maintenance. Pumping water with electricity costs a lot, farmers say.Agriculture experts, however, say though spring paddy areas have shrunk, the spring maize farming acreage has been increasing in recent times. “The production of maize is increasing in the Tarai compared to spring paddy,” said Pandey. Experts say that most farmers grow hybrid maize. The use of superior hybrid seeds has boosted production, and farmers have switched from paddy to maize nowadays, said Pandey. \nChairman of Kantipur Media Group Kailash Sirohiya on Tuesday said Kantipur Media Group will never compromise on its editorial independence and responsibilities.On Tuesday, Dhanusha District Court issued an arrest warrant against Sirohiya over a ‘citizenship-related issue’.In a statement, Sirohiya said the arrest warrant was issued with the intent of blackmailing Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue of cooperative frauds.“It is the media’s responsibility to raise voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” said Sirohiya. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.” Sirohiya asserted that Kantipur will not back down even an inch from raising its voice against the wrongdoings in the society, including on the cooperatives scam.“The office bearers who abuse their authority and misuse police administration to exact vengeance against the chairman of a media house based on the news they publish should also answer when there will be an investigation into the individual who came to power through political bargaining that entailed getting the Attorney General to certify that he would not be prosecuted for holding dual passports,” he said.Sirohiya said he is ready to cooperate in every investigation conducted as per the law. \nNepali Congress lawmakers have objected to the arrest warrant against Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya, saying that it was issued at the behest of those in power. The lawmakers said that the warrant came as an attack on the press and an assault on democracy.They visited the KMG’s central office at Thapathali, Kathmandu, and expressed their firm resolve to defend press freedom and democracy in the country.Congress lawmaker NP Saud, who is a former foreign minister, said they will not tolerate the crackdown targeting an independent media organisation. “We stand with Kantipur. This is an attempt at intimidation under the influence of power. It is an attack on democratic values and press freedom,” said Saud.Congress lawmaker Rajendra Bajgain questioned: “What is the prime minister trying to achieve by attacking Kantipur, which has fought for democracy?”Lawmaker Bir Bahadur Balayar emphasised the need for broad unity in response to not just any actions against Sirohiya but also against democracy and press freedom.Lawmaker Pratima Gautam said the warrant came as a bid to divert the issue of cooperative fraud. “We stand with Kantipur for democracy and press freedom,” she expressed her solidarity. MP Raju Thapa accused Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of attempting to bargain with the media and retaliating when he did not succesed. “The home minister should be arrested in the cooperatives [savings misappropriation] case,” he said.Lamichhane faces allegations of investing hundreds of millions of rupees illegally borrowed from a number of cooperatives into the now shuttered Galaxy TV when he steered the company.Lawmaker Chanda Chaudhary, at the Kantipur office, said they stand with Kantipur as it raises issues of public concern.Lawmaker Deepak Giri highlighted the contribution of Kantipur media outlets to democracy. “The government is trying to scare the Kantipur. There is a need to protest and retaliate against the attempt to intimidate the media organisation by filing fake cases,” he said.Lawmaker Kusum Thapa Magar condemned the crackdown on the dissemination of fair news against the cooperatives fraud, while Congress leader Govinda Pokharel said the arrest warrant against Sirohiya was a step against democracy. Also speaking, lawmaker Ram Krishna Yadav said Kantipur had made contributed significant to safeguarding democracy.MP Shyam Ghimire described the arrest warrant as an attack on democracy, adding that the incident should be taken seriously.Lawmaker Nagina Yadav slammed the government for displaying arrogance in Parliament and the home minister for its approach to the Kantipur daily in particular. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal took the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Monday amid protest by the main opposition, Nepali Congress.Meanwhile, industrialist Upendra Mahato demanded an impartial investigation into the issue.Thanking the lawmakers for expressing solidarity with him, KMG Chairman Sirohiya renewed his commitment to fighting corruption and irregularities and supporting democracy as the media’s duty towards the public.Sirohiya said he was ready to assist the administration in the investigation and termed the issuance of the arrest warrant without questioning him a retaliatory move. He demanded an impartial investigation against the home minister as well in the citizenship case.“He [Rabi Lamichhane] should also be investigated for holding two citizenships. The investigation against me should also be impartial and transparent. I am ready to cooperate,” he said. \nPolice on Tuesday arrested Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya.A police team, including Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai and Superintendent of Police Rabindra Regmi of Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office, arrested Sirohiya from the Thapathali-based central office of the media group.Police arrested Sirohiya without questioning him on a complaint filed at the Dhanusha District Police Office.The arrest follows a series of news reports carried out by KMG’s outlets on the cooperative scam. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is accused of misappropriating millions of rupees deposited in various cooperatives in several cities. Talking to the media briefly after his arrest, Sirohiya said the government showed authoritarian characteristics [by arresting him] despite his willingness to assist in the investigation.Sirohiya also described his arrest as a blow to press freedom. “This is an assault on press freedom, and I will fight until the end,” he said.Earlier today, Sirohiya said he was ready to cooperate in every investigation conducted as per the law. In a statement, Sirohiya said the arrest warrant was issued to blackmail Kantipur daily into not publishing more reports on cooperative frauds.“It is the media’s responsibility to raise voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” Sirohiya said. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.”Sirohiya asserted that Kantipur will not back down even an inch from raising its voice against the wrongdoings in the society, including on the cooperatives scam.“The office bearers who abuse their authority and misuse police administration to exact vengeance against the chairman of a media house based on the news they publish should also answer when there will be an investigation into the individual who came to power through political bargaining that entailed getting the Attorney General to certify that he would not be prosecuted for holding dual passports,” Sirohiya said. \nHome Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Tuesday committed a gross abuse of his authority by sending Nepal Police to have Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which publishes The Kathmandu Post, arrested. Sirohiya was at work as police officers barged into his office at the KMG headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu.We have no objection with law enforcement officers fulfilling their duty as per the law of the land, and are committed to fully supporting the state in an impartial investigation on the alleged discrepancies in Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate. However, we are also cognisant of the politics of vendetta being pursued against Sirohiya by Home Minister Lamichhane, who has been riled by the consistent, fact-based reporting of Kantipur, our sister publication, on his alleged involvement in cooperative frauds.Coming on the heels of the persistent calls for a parliamentary probe into his alleged frauds, Lamichhane has made no secrets about his intention to play the politics of vendetta against the KMG. This is not the first time Lamichhane has launched an attack against the group. Over a year ago, as he struggled to salvage his image in the wake of the case against dual citizenship, Lamichhane opened a barrage of unsubstantiated allegations against KMG. That Lamichhane has a grudge against the group for fulfilling its duty of fearless, factual reporting is thus well-documented.But the home minister’s action against KMG should not be taken as a singular event. It is, rather, an attack on press freedom through the misuse of state machinery, and it is going to set a dangerous precedent. It is ironic that Lamichhane, a former mediaperson, has taken an authoritarian approach of punishing another mediaperson for unfavourable reporting about him. In having Sirohiya arrested, Lamichhane has exposed his undemocratic credentials as a politician.Sirohiya’s arrest takes us back to the early 2000s, when press freedom was at an awfully low point. In 2001, the then government had arrested Kantipur Publication publishers Kailash Sirohiya and Binod Raj Gyawali as well as Kantipur Editor-In-Chief Yubraj Ghimire on the grounds of publishing an opinion article that it considered “objectionable”. Later, in 2005, when King Gyanendra Shah imposed dictatorial rule, he sent the country's army and police forces to the newsrooms of Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, along with dozens of other newsrooms in the Kathmandu valley and elsewhere in the country to ensure that no negative news about the government could be published. Over almost three decades of its service to the nation, the private media houses in Nepal, with Kantipur Publications at its head, have repeatedly stood up to injustices and defended the rights of the citizens—and they will continue to report on corruption cases such as the one the home minister is embroiled in. The politics of vendetta and fear has never worked in favour of authoritarian regimes, and it will not work this time around. The Nepali media has never bowed down to the politics of fear and, rest assured, we will continue to fulfil our duty of informing the citizens without fear or favour.  \nAfter weeks of uncertainty, things had started to appear a touch clearer from Saturday evening. A meeting of top leaders from major political parties—both ruling and opposition ones—agreed to end the House deadlock by forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam with links to Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The leaders formed a taskforce of four second-rung leaders to prepare terms of reference for the probe panel. While defining the jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee, the task force member from Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party even became ready to list the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane had allegedly received money. Whether to specifically mention Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction remained the major bone of contention and the members were trying to find a meeting point. In the meantime, the main opposition Nepali Congress became ready to allow Home Minister Lamichhane to address the House. For weeks, Lamichhane had been arguing that it was injustice to bar him from speaking in Parliament, thus depriving him of a chance at clarification. As per the understanding, Lamichhane addressed the House. Unfortunately, Lamichhane presented himself in an utterly irresponsible way, spending most of his time slinging mud at opposition lawmakers, and the Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa in particular—in fact at all those who were asking for a probe against him. He threw caution to the wind and tore parliamentary decorum to shreds. Had he presented himself in a responsible way and had he really wanted to use the opportunity to clear the old deadlock, his Sunday’s speech in the House could have been a turning point. Alas! It was just the opposite. He further provoked the opposition and spoiled the situation that was headed in a positive direction. The crux of his over half-an-hour-long lecture was that “if you all [leaders from opposition parties] have for so many years engaged in various wrongdoings, why should I be punished for following the same corrupt path?” He disappointed many of those who reckoned that the main opposition was doing Lamichhane injustice by depriving him of a chance to speak out on the allegations leveled against him. Instead of explaining his case based on facts, figures and documents, he threatened to reopen old cases in which opposition leaders were allegedly involved. While issuing such threats, he seemed to forget that he is the home minister who can immediately order law enforcement agencies to investigate and take actions against those involved in such crimes, including those publishing ‘baseless’ news against him. In doing so, he not only disappointed his followers but also, perhaps inadvertently, suggested that the country’s home minister is helpless to act while all kinds of grave crimes are happening all around him. Leaders often engage in heated arguments in the House. But someone in Lamichhane’s position—deputy prime minister, home minister and chair of the fourth largest parliamentary party—is expected to exercise a minimum level of restraint. When they speak from the Parliament’s rostrum, they not only address other lawmakers in the hall but also millions of people in and outside the country. Lamichhane went way beyond that red line on Sunday. His no-holds-barred speech is not the kind of precedent the holders of highest offices in the country should be setting.    \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nNepal, despite minimal greenhouse gas emissions, faces severe climate change impacts due to its vulnerability, with local governments playing a crucial role in minimizing vulnerability and building community resilience, but facing challenges in implementation due to capacity issues and insufficient resource mobilization.\nMourners gather in Tabriz for President Ebrahim Raisi and others killed in a helicopter crash, amid a deepening crisis in Iran's clerical leadership.\nAn emergency landing in Bangkok by a Singapore Airlines flight from London resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries due to severe turbulence.\nTaiwanese parliamentarians engaged in a chaotic dispute over opposition-led parliament oversight reforms, sparking protests and accusations of Chinese influence.\nPoland detained nine suspects for sabotage on behalf of Russian services, targeting the country due to its role in supplying Ukraine.\nIn 'Guilty or Not Guilty,' a murder mystery play, the audience plays the jury, determining the fate of a femme fatale accused of murdering her wealthy lover, with secrets and biases influencing their verdict.\nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nBright blue bookshelves, a sunny courtyard, and a friendly librarian—Junkiri: The Feminist Library is a vibrant and welcoming communal space located in Dhokatole, Kathmandu. Currently, it houses more than 2,500 books and has over 700 members.This library is an initiative of VOW (Voices of Women) Media that aims to increase feminist education by providing easy access to feminist literature, tools and resources to women and girls.The library initially opened on March 8, 2020, but unfortunately, due to lockdown, it had to close down just two weeks later, on March 23. However, in August 2022, the library resumed its operations, welcoming readers back once again.Libraries have never been a neutral space. They have always, in some ways, reflected the various biases, values and power structures of their communities. Not only is there a bias in the selection of library material, but there is also a bias in cataloguing and categorisation. Most notably, the Decimal Dewy System is known to have significant biases against marginalised communities. For example, pregnancy, quite outrageously, is categorised in the disease section through this system. Historically, male authors have dominated intellectual life, which is why it is so crucial to amplify the voices of women through literature and libraries that promote works written by women. Education is a site for social change and transformation, and access to feminist education is crucial in increasing feminist consciousness. In Nepal, the urgency for a feminist library is greater than ever. While progress has been made in areas such as legal reforms and women’s representation in politics, it is still difficult for many people to understand basic concepts like consent and recognition when a minor has been groomed. The victim-blaming culture has also significantly hindered progress.A feminist library serves as a beacon of change against society’s regressions that disproportionately look down on women. Junkiri, as well as VOW media, have played pivotal roles in promoting feminist pedagogy. As a free library, they promote a collaborative and participatory learning environment that values personal narratives. As a community, Junkiri not only educates young girls on topics like consent and raises awareness on feminist issues but also serves as a supportive and guiding community for its members.The library’s collection is divided into three sections: children, young adults, and adults. The children’s section features bright, colourful, and engaging graphic books that educate children about essential topics such as consent, diversity, and empathy. The young adult and adult sections also feature a diverse range of literature, including novels, research books and a selection of queer literature. At first, the library relied on door-to-door marketing around its community to secure members, but it has since expanded through word of mouth. Jenisha Niroula, a library member, says, “I love going to Junkiri because of its jolly environment, especially when they organise children’s reading circles, encouraging young minds to read. I also find many books from female writers that I cannot find elsewhere.” The library organises a reading circle featuring various children's books with around 15-20 children in the community. This fosters a reading culture and helps children bond over books.Junkiri recently organised a Feminist Writing Workshop, encouraging participants to adopt a feminist perspective in their reading analysis and writing. Sam, a library member and a workshop participant, says, “I loved the workshop experience. It was helpful to learn about the ways of critiquing articles and practising writing as a feminist. I also love spending time in the library because of its welcoming librarian and reading space at such a low price.”“A communal space where children of different class groups inter-mingle is becoming increasingly important to foster empathy and bring down the divide between the rich and poor,” says Pooja Panta, the founder of VOW Media. The lack of community spaces in Kathmandu has brought about numerous challenges, and Junkiri plays a crucial role in filling this void by not only offering a communal space but also by supporting feminist literature and amplifying the voices of female and queer authors.Junkiri also serves as an archive. Editions of decade-old Asmita Magazine stored in a box can transport readers into various times in Nepali history when feminists tirelessly advocated for rights and articulated their challenges. “It is sometimes sad to think how very little has changed, and the challenges that women face have remained the same,” says Shashikala Khadka, the librarian.Books and magazines from various time periods serve as valuable resources for young feminists. They offer insights into the nuanced challenges faced by feminists throughout history. By studying these materials, they can better understand their role in disseminating feminist knowledge in the present day.“The best thing about Junkiri is that I don’t have to explain my beliefs as it is a safe space that promotes sisterhood and supports women,” says the librarian. She also recounts instances of individuals on Twitter who resist the feminist movement in general. “Being a feminist has become increasingly villainised, with its meaning being twisted, leading many people to hesitate in identifying with the term,” she adds.Shashikala also helps curate the library. Initially, the books were sourced from donations, but the library has recently begun purchasing to add to its collection. She also stresses the need for more Nepali graphic novels for children and Nepali novels for young adults.“Change is a relay race, it does not happen overnight, but you have to lay the groundwork for the future generation to carry it forward,” Shashikala emphasises.Junkiri is changing existing structures to improve access to feminist resources and information. It stands as the go-to destination for readers seeking thought-provoking literary works while also fostering a community centred on sisterhood and empathy.Junkiri is open Tuesday through Friday (1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.) and Saturday (10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.). The membership fee is Rs100. \nWho hasn’t created a quirky one-liner and wanted to put it on a T-shirt? And if the t-shirt bit isn’t an option, when someone thinks of something clever, it might go straight to their social media. The impulse to share our thoughts and feelings and seek validation for them pervades human nature; we can’t help it—because don’t we all like a bit of attention at heart?In Siddhartha Art Gallery’s latest exhibition, “Sawari Kathahru: Art in Motion,” witty phrases found on trucks, along with the desire to share them with the world, are on full display. This exhibition celebrates 'truck poetry' and shayaris adorning vehicles, showcasing the humour and creativity of the drivers who compose these verses and the artists who bring them to life.This multimedia exhibition includes a documentary entitled ‘Literature on Wheels’ by Urza Acharya, the gallery’s media coordinator. It features photographs by writer Sravasti Ghosh and Abushan Gautam, a journalist based in London and illustrations by graphic designer Shubha Joshi. Additionally, visitors can engage with interviews featuring truck drivers, available on loop through headphones, and enjoy an intriguing table game.Various sections of photographs that labelled religion, love, and politics show how these one-liners span various genres. Browsing through the photographs of trucks adorned with various wit, humour, highs, and lows is a delightful experience; each image is bound to elicit a giggle. My favourite is ‘Kancha, Love Ma Dhoka Khanu Bhanda Aau, Mero Bike Pachadi Basera Ktm Ko Dhulo Khau.’This roughly translates to; Come, sit on my bike because it’s better to inhale Kathmandu’s dust than to be deceived in love. However, beneath the surface of humour and wit, keen viewers will notice something intriguing: the truck art and poems serve as an unofficial archive, reflecting the evolution of the country’s politics, religious practices and social interactions. While frequent travellers on Nepal’s roads are familiar with this unique form of expression, viewing the various images together makes viewers contemplate its evolution over the years. Take, for instance, the increasing appearance of Balen Shah in truck art, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City—a testament to his political popularity. Political discussions such as those concerning the ‘Greater Nepal’ map are also popular subjects in truck art. While truck art mostly reflects the consciousness, opinions and feelings of individual drivers, collectively, it also mirrors the prevailing ideas, opinions and perspectives within our country. The documentary ‘Literature on Wheels’ is an interesting glimpse into the world of truck art. Its quirky, upbeat music and font directly mirror the uplifting and unserious mood of truck shayaris and truck poems. This documentary provides a behind-the-scenes look, interviewing drivers and artists to uncover how truck art is conceived and applied. The documentary is heartwarming. While watching it, I couldn’t help but feel that, deep down, we are all poets driven by an innate need to share our emotions and artistic expressions with the world. It left me with a profound appreciation for the universal human inclination towards artistry, regardless of our backgrounds or occupations.There is a table game in the exhibition that adds to the fun while you appreciate truck art as you browse through the photographs. It is an immersive game that encourages you to make your poem. While I may have lingered a bit too long on this aspect—letting my quirkiness shine through—I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself spending an extended period here as well, fully immersed in the fun and creativity it offers. Despite the exhibition’s many strengths, I couldn’t help but notice that, in some ways, it feels disjointed. I believe it might not be ready to fully embrace its status as a multimedia exploration. While all the exhibition components share the common theme of illuminating Nepali truck art, the absence of a cohesive narrative or overarching framework seems to cause the multimedia effort to falter.Individually, each component of the exhibition shines brightly. I couldn’t shake the feeling that a unifying storyline or thematic thread connecting all the experiences would have made the exhibition more engaging and immersive.The interview presented in headphones on a loop is somewhat confusing because of its non-linearity. This aspect could be improved by replacing it with musical shayaris playing on a loop instead. This adjustment would better align with the exhibition’s goal of fostering an appreciation for poetry and art than the current interview format.Making a point that says truck art, often viewed as gaudy, deserves appreciation by framing them in an art exhibition, while well-intentioned, may not fully convey the intended message and could be perceived as slightly disconnected from the exhibition's overall theme. Perhaps considering additional approaches, such as including more in-depth interviews in a video format with drivers and artists, could have better highlighted the significance of appreciating truck art within the context of the exhibition.This exhibition highlights the often-overlooked art surrounding us daily and validates its significance. I am looking forward to this exhibition and all its components continuing to develop and evolve, perhaps with the addition of a captivating storyline or poetic symbolism. It would be wonderful to see a longer documentary and a wider selection of photographs that delve into the stories of the drivers and artists behind this art form.To truly stand out, this exhibition can provide more than just a compilation of truck poetry. I believe it requires something deeper, something more profound. After all, truck poetry is readily visible outside; offering additional evocative elements would have enhanced the art exhibition experience. With a more cohesive approach, I believe this concept has the potential to become an even more enriching experience.  \nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nGlobal Dairy Private Limited has started commercial production of butter milk, known as mohi in Nepali.Mohi, known as mattha in Hindi, a popular fermented dairy drink originating in the Indian subcontinent, is the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. The dairy plant in Imilia in ward 9 of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district has been producing 1,000 litres of mohi daily since mid-April. The company said the demand for the drink, a good source of protein and calcium, has been growing.In Nepal, it is consumed especially during the summer. The producer said that traditionally the drink used to be a favourite in villages, but gradually lost its appeal to more popular beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“That is why we have started the production and branding of mohi,” said Thaneshwor Neupane, chairman of Global Dairy. “We are the first Nepali company to start the commercial production of bottled mohi and label it. We have introduced the product in the market with attractive packaging.”The company has expanded sales and distribution to six districts of Lumbini province. “This is our first phase of expansion. We have planned to go across Nepal,” said Neupane.The brand, ‘Buddhabhumi’, is named after the birthplace of Buddha. Shankar Pandey, finance chief of the company, said that the drinks give energy and refresh people. The retail price is Rs50 per litre bottle. The dairy factory said it has spent Rs15 on each bottle and its labelling, bringing the total cost to Rs38-40 per bottle, Pandey said.“We have given special focus to maintaining the standard and purity of mohi.”Mohi is made from curd recommended by the food technologist. First, the substance that turns milk into curd is tested. After that, the acidic and potential hydrogen levels are tested, and mohi is made only from consumable curd.The curd is then mixed with processed water in a machine until it reaches the right consistency for bottling. The finished product is packaged in sets of 12 bottles and is sent to the market based on demand.“Bottling is also nice, and the taste is also good,” said Punaram Aryal, a consumer from Imilia.The company said 28,000 litres of mohi have been sold so far since its production started last week. The mohi produced is consumable within 5-6 days from the date of manufacture.According to locals, mohi has become a great option to other cold beverages produced by multinational companies. “Public response to the product is positive and this has encouraged us,” Neupane said.The factory currently has been producing 3,000 litres of mohi daily, Neupane said.Rajendra Singh Lodh, a food technologist, said special attention has been given to the purity and quality of the product.In Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, it is also said that drinking mohi after meals makes the body healthy and active. Daily consumption of mohi boosts immunity and improves the digestive system, according to food technologists.Mohi is rich in potassium, calcium, and protein. It also gives the body freshness and hydrates it.Drinking mohi is also considered beneficial for people fighting long-term diseases.Global Dairy, which has been operating for a decade, has started producing mohi as a new product, with an investment of Rs500 million. The company, which has been producing 50,000 litres of milk daily, said it is planning to increase the capacity to 100,000 litres.It aims to produce powdered milk too.“If the marketing of mohi goes well, then it will also be a boon for dairy farmers who often face milk holidays,” said dairy farmer Shiva Gulam Kori of Budhhabhmi municipality.The company has 79 collection centres in Lumbini province and two in Sudurpaschim province, and it has 15,000 farmers associated with it. It sells dairy products by coordinating with around 500 collection centres across the province. The company has provided direct employment to 200 people.Dr Mukesh Chaudhary, the medical chief of Kapilvastu Hospital, said that mohi is more beneficial to health compared to other cold drinks. “It is important to drink mohi for vitamins D and calcium. It hydrates the body and balances the body's temperature.”    \nCimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, achieved a milestone by delivering 50 units of cutting-edge BYD electric vehicles (EVs) in a single day. The company said that on May 18, it sold 50 BYD EVs from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu. The event, filled with excitement and anticipation, witnessed the delivery of BYD ATTO 3 and BYD Dolphin EVs to eager customers, signalling a paradigm shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions in Nepal, the company said in a statement. In a gesture of commitment to customer satisfaction and safety, Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd also introduced the first generation BYD e6, dating back to 2017, as a dedicated roadside assistance vehicle during the handover event. This initiative underscores Cimex's unwavering dedication to providing comprehensive support and services to BYD EV owners, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable driving experience. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nOver 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 will be inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) during a nationwide immunisation drive starting next Sunday.Officials said, children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.“All necessary preparations regarding IPV vaccination to the children deprived of the vaccine are being completed,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The vaccine will be administered in schools, booths and health posts.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nAs India reports an outbreak of West Nile virus, Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population said it has been assessing the risk of the deadly disease in the country.Nepal is facing a high risk of several vector-borne diseases, including the outbreak of West Nile fever, due to rising temperatures, looming monsoon, the presence of virus-spreading vectors in the country, and free movement of people between the two countries, officials said.“We are aware of the outbreak of West Nile fever in India,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “International Health Regulations also require us to increase our vigilance against the disease.”West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year. \nOver 600 people with respiratory illnesses seek care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the hospital runs its out-patient service. The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes. There is no mention of the issue of air pollution,” said Bhusan Tuladhar, an environmental expert. “How can we mitigate the effects of air pollution, without addressing the problem?” \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nManchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times. It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble. \nArmed Police Force Club women’s dominance continued in domestic cricket as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by two runs in a thrilling final to win their fourth consecutive title at the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.APF have now won all four editions of the championship. They had entered the tournament as the winners of the Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament. APF have also terrorised the PM Cup winning six out of nine editions.For Sudurpaschim, they have now fallen short in the title match for a third time against APF after also reaching the final in 2021 and 2022. Koshi had reached the final in 2023.In fact, Sudurpaschim, who were chasing 153, almost ended APF’s stranglehold in the championship on Saturday when Kabita Joshi smashed three sixes in the 19th over to leave her side only needing six runs from the last over for a historic victory.Kabita Joshi played an unbeaten innings of 67 runs and Laxmi Saud made 29 not out to take Sudurpaschim from 49-5 in the seventh over to 150-5 (101-run partnership) before the final over, and inch closer to their first title.But the duo ran out of batteries when needed most as they could only manage three runs from the last over, thanks to a tight bowling from Rekha Rawal.Joshi’s 45-ball knock featured seven boundaries and three sixes.Captain Bindu Rawal contributed 19 off 17, while Sabitri Dhami made 12 off nine balls and Samjhana Khadka played 8-ball 10 for Sudurpaschim.Karuna Bhandari took 2-20 including the wicket of dangerous Khadka who had scored two fifties in this tournament.Earlier, APF opted to bat first and posted a big total of 155-4 with the help of half-centuries from openers Rajmati Airee and Sita Rana Magar.Airee scored 50 runs off 46 balls hitting seven fours. Captain Rana Magar cracked eight fours in her 55-ball 74. The opening duo also added 91 runs for the first wicket.National team skipper added nine, Roma Thapa contributed six and Mamta Chaudhary made 10 not out to guide APF to a huge total.Radhika Pujara, Bindu and Ritu Kanoujiya took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim. \nTribhuvan Army Club's Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club's Rajpura Pachhai triumphed in the men's and women's half-marathons at the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon, with Ramesh Khatri and Aaishwarya Kumal defending their wheelchair race titles.\nThe 12th annual Kantipur Half Marathon, with over 3,000 participants, commenced with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal officially inaugurating the event.\nICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for Israeli PM Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.\nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, including prominent works by Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin, despite laws against copyright infringement.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nWeather forecasts over the past several months have been failing—last winter was dry, and the expected rain in April/May, which would mark the beginning of the farming calendar, has been largely nominal. A few drizzles helped douse the wildfires that had engulfed large swaths in several districts but not nearly enough to build up soil moisture for summer crops. However, the drought made headlines for a different reason—especially when the wildfires worsened the already polluted air, making Kathmandu the most polluted city globally.Extreme weather events, including droughts, largely driven by global phenomena, have been wearying our opportunities and attempts to prosper. Key sectors like agriculture and hydropower, which Nepal banks on for economic growth, are severely impacted. Yet, the issue is not getting the attention it deserves at home. Extensive drought While our climate concerns remained focused on rising temperatures and the loss of snow deposits, Nepal’s National Climate Change Survey Report, published last Monday, unsurprisingly revealed that widespread droughts are the foremost climate stressors affecting Nepal, hitting its agriculture the hardest. A staggering 65 percent of households and their farms have been continually affected by droughts for the last 25 years. No wonder our farming is shrinking like never before. The report cited the dramatic increase in diseases and insects affecting crops as well. About 50 percent of the households surveyed reported the emergence of new diseases in crops, and an even greater percentage reported the presence of new insects/pests affecting food production.Consequently, fewer people are interested in farming; those who want to continue are being discouraged by these increased threats with no support whatsoever from the state. Alarmingly, the state fails to realise that if it doesn't extend meaningful and sustained support to tackle droughts, mainly in the hills, more people will be forced to quit farming—the direct repercussions of which will be a failure to meet the poverty and hunger goals of Agenda 2030. A drought-induced water shortage will also affect other goals such as health, gender, clean water and sanitation.The survey’s shocking figures regarding water sources, especially for the hilly regions, are extremely worrying, to say the least. Nearly all households in the hills and the mountains in Karnali Province experienced a decrease in water in the streams. Likewise, over two-thirds of households in Sudurpaschim and Karnali hills reported streams completely drying up. About 80 percent of respondents in the Koshi hills reported springs and kuwas drying up. The figure is around 75 percent for Karnali and Sudurpaschim hills. Half of all households in Sudurpaschim-Tarai and around 30 percent in Madhesh-Terai reported hand pumps completely parched. The survey found that almost half of all households have started using higher amounts of chemical fertilisers and improved seeds as adaptation measures. Water conservation, which would have helped address droughts, is practised by a mere 12 percent of the households, with only 2 percent relying on ponds to store rainwater—the sustainable and effective way to combat droughts. Drying local water sources do not simply affect a few people who depend on them to meet domestic and agricultural water needs; they are a visible sign of the changes that have been taking place over decades—something the water managers failed to notice. In fact, anecdotes tell us that people have been displaced by one or another water-induced disaster since the early 1960s. The only difference is that the number of people leaving their villages then was small, and most could find better opportunities in urban centres within the country. Now, thousands of youths wanting to leave their villages due to the same disasters that pushed others to migrate over half a century ago are searching for better opportunities that are no longer available in the country. The other extreme Despite droughts, the overall amount of annual rainfall hasn’t changed much, which points to the very interesting but disturbing rise of the other extreme—high-intensity rain causing damaging floods. The report indicates a changing flood scenario, especially in the hills and the mountains. Nearly 65 percent of the mountain households experienced floods capable of harming physical infrastructure in the last five years, while around half of all households experienced landslides of the same calibre. The hilly region is no exception—nearly 50 percent of the households in the hills were affected by damaging floods and almost 41 percent by landslides. We are starting to see the consequences too. In 2021, the floods in Melamchi, which drastically changed the river morphology, crippled the Melamchi Water Project, built over two decades to bring water to Kathmandu with a price tag of over Rs35 billion. Two years later, heavy rains and floods damaged the physical structures of 31 hydropower projects in eastern Nepal, with an estimated loss of over Rs8 billion. This is a firm reminder that as the drought conditions intensify, so do the risks of severe floods, which will have repercussions on the government’s plan to produce 30,000 MW by 2035 to meet both domestic and export needs. The nature of rainfall-induced floods in the mountain rivers, where large projects—especially hydropower plants—are built, are poorly understood and have become extremely unpredictable due to the shift in rainfall distribution. Short-duration high-intensity hill rains leave little time for advance warning or safety preparations.Troubling times aheadThe promising economic sectors have all been affected by a degradation of the foundation they depend upon—the state of the natural environment, which is undergoing changes at the core, largely connected by changing seasonal hydrology. Though the authorities and communities can collectively breathe a great sigh of relief as light rain in early May doused the wildfires and reduced the chances of their spread this year, we need to be reminded that the year 2023 was the hottest year on record; there’s no reason why 2024 and beyond won’t continue to break the record, especially with no letup in emissions. The resulting winter droughts in the years ahead are likely to be longer and more intense, along with the increased frequency of devastating floods. Droughts will continue to impact food production. Forest fires will continue to cover large areas as the factors that trigger them continue to build up and spread. However, we can and need to encourage as many households as possible to save monsoon rainwater in dugout ponds to help revive the lost or declining water sources. We cannot remain complacent and oblivious to how deep-rooted the problem has gotten.  \nElated after clearing the advocate licensing exam, a young lawyer—adorned in a new black suit and white shirt—walks into the Bar but is told to “be seated behind the furniture railing”. Dispirited, the person walks into a bar where the bartender says, “You can’t practice law here”. Both the Bar and the bar serve as metaphors here, but they are significant in understanding the challenges young lawyers face after years of formal education and passing the bar exams following admission to the Bar. While the Bar admits them, it does not adopt or foster them. The junior bar has always felt orphaned by the Bar; therefore, it most likely will once more renew its demand to the Nepal Bar Association (NBA) to redress the plight of young lawyers in the biennial jamboree of lawyers being held on May 17, 18 and 19.Conference of lawyersThe NBA brings together lawyers from all over Nepal for a three-day conference every two years. The biennial conference is distinct from the annual general meetings held every year. One unique feature of the NBA is that compared to some other professional associations, it disjoints the elections to choose office-bearers from the convention of lawyers. This year, the conference is centred around two themes. The first theme, “Competent Lawyers, Dignified Bar”, a trade union issue, corresponds to the NBA’s objective to increase the public’s confidence and esteem regarding law practice. The second theme, “Restructuring of the Judiciary”, aligns with the broader public interest concern to increase faith in the judiciary and enhance the independence of the court and judges. Between the two themes, there are no prizes for guessing that the first, although more important for the junior bar, will receive less consideration than the second. This is because the second theme carries with it constitutional overtones, which effortlessly capture the interest of the lawyers. Lawyers will take part in an expressive debate on a range of topics, such as the hierarchy of Bar and non-Bar judicial appointees, the rationale behind the representation of the Chief Justice in the Constitutional Council, the judiciary-executive balance in the Judicial Council, the necessity of parliamentary hearing of judges, and the judicial performance of the Constitutional Bench. The conference must furnish realistic proposals for constitutional amendments. After all, if the Bar is strengthened to protect the independence of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will, in turn, be able to protect the Constitution. Barring politicsA lawyer is entitled to be a supporter or member of a political party or hold a specific political belief. Political allegiance should not be a cause to target a lawyer, nor should it be a reason to debar or discourage them from building a practice. Lawyers’ political leanings and inclinations inherently attach them to politics. However, the political influence that people trained in law are able to exert in public affairs, because they occupy more than one-third share among the three state-political organs, inquires into the political affiliation of lawyers and their proclivities an inquisitive exercise. The election for the barkeepers of the NBA, which is held every three years, conducted by dividing the candidates into panels organised openly under the tutelage of political parties, exacerbates the politics of party division and polarisation. Therefore, the question confronting the NBA today is whether its members should “practise law” or “practise politics”. The answer is obvious: The NBA cannot be an apolitical organisation, but at the same time, the practice of law should come before the practice of politics for the members of the Bar. Hence, rather than prioritising party politics, the NBA’s primary focus should be on the welfare of lawyers, continuing legal education, increasing the professional competency of its members, meritorious (and also inclusive) standards for judicial elevations, accountability of the judges and their independence and, of course, guidance and counselling for young lawyers. If the NBA can notch significant achievements on these fronts, its elections structured in party lines might be considered excusable. A Bar Association co-opted by political parties will neither garner the public’s confidence nor encourage young lawyers to participate in the Bar’s politics. Raise the junior bar Let’s circle back to the initial topic concerning the young advocate entering the Bar. Earlier last month, the Nepal Bar Council allowed entry to approximately 950 lawyers, mostly young graduates. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see more and more students showing interest in studying law and starting a career in law each year. On the other hand, a shrinking economy, inadequate employment opportunities, uncertainty regarding the future of a legal career, and the allure to migrate abroad for better jobs and living prospects are a few factors that discourage young graduates from building legal practice.Although young law graduates acquire knowledge of law in law schools, they have little understanding of how to establish the practice of law. The intervention of the Bar becomes necessary here, especially to ease the transition for young graduates from law school knowledge to practical legal skills. For the Bar, the first task is to bring all the issues to the table and establish a connection with the latest crop of young lawyers to understand their needs and concerns. An institutionalised and active junior Bar section is positioned to fill the connection gap. The second task for the Bar, running a mentorship initiative to cultivate the professional skills of young lawyers, is far easier to conceive than execute. But there is always a place to begin. The Bar should applaud the law firms already recruiting young lawyers and providing them exposure to legal practice. In addition, the Bar has to take the initiative to create a platform to bring together different generations of lawyers for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Lastly, the Bar can leverage its relationship with other industry and professional associations to increase internship and job opportunities and hold career expos. Young lawyers are future leaders of the Bar but are also integral to the legal practice at present. The Bar cannot afford for them to fail. The NBA’s biennial conference should not be limited to a speech festival but should place young lawyers at the centre of its declarations. The responsibility of the Bar lies in ensuring that the graduates who passed out after taking the Bar examination do not pass-out from the legal profession.   \nMedia literacy empowers individuals to critically analyse the complex media landscape, enabling informed decision-making and fostering active societal participation. Unfortunately, the Government of Nepal, media houses, civil society organisations and media development organisations don’t prioritise it. As a result, media literacy is thinly referenced in our legislative framework. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 articulates the right to opinion and expression (Article 17[2a]), the right to communication (Article 19), and information (Article 27) while not mentioning the phrase. However, these provisions indirectly advocate for media literacy. Similarly, the National Mass Communications Policy 2016, without using the phrase, indirectly calls for actions promoting the same. For instance, Objective 1.1 of the National Mass Communications Policy seeks to create a civilised and prosperous society by ensuring accountable mass media based on democratic principles and the right to freedom of expression. This involves integrating media literacy through promoting access to diverse information sources and promoting critical thinking skills.Critical thinking The National Census of Nepal 2021 (2078 BS) records Nepal's literacy rate at 76.3 percent, with disparities in literacy levels among different geographic regions, castes, creeds and ethnicities. The literacy rate itself tells about the status of media literacy in Nepal.Most of the population tends to accept media information at face value, lacking the ability or inclination to analyse its content critically. A section of the population, comprising social activists, media workers, teachers, businesspersons and professionals, applies critical lenses to the media’s content. Various factors influence media content, including ownership, advertising, political ideology, philosophical inclinations, diversity of media workers, corporate interests and soft power dynamics. In research for his Master of Philosophy thesis, Govinda Dhital has written that headteachers in secondary schools demonstrate high levels of media literacy across seven dimensions: Access, retrieval, understanding, use/communication, analysis, evaluation and creativity.The audience's response and feedback to media content also serve as indicators of media literacy. However, this engagement seems to have diminished over the past decade. Interestingly, scandals and gossip about political leaders and celebrities and stories related to love, sex and failed social relationships still receive engagement from the audience, especially on social media. Notably, short, entertaining videos on platforms like TikTok often garner more interaction than in-depth investigative news reports despite the latter requiring significant resources and efforts to produce.Another indicator of the general population's critical awareness is the extent to which people file complaints about media performance. According to the Press Council Nepal’s database, 221 complaints were registered against the media in 2079-80 BS (2022-23), compared to 203 complaints registered in the PCN in 2078-79 BS (2021-22) and 192 in 2077-78 BS (2020-21).Evaluating content Most people find it challenging to evaluate the credibility and reliability of various media sources, a critical aspect of media literacy. Many are unaware of the potential biases or affiliations of media houses with corporate entities, power holders or the government. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals took health decisions based on misleading information, exemplifying the lack of source evaluation skills. This led to a surge in the acquisition of Vitamin D capsules, giloy (gurjo) herbs and turmeric.People also fail to understand media techniques like framing, editing and using language or images to manipulate or sway opinions, indicating a low level of media literacy. During the campaign for the 2022 parliamentary elections in Nepal, social media users disseminated doctored photographs of politicians and exploited out-of-context video clips to confuse voters. Additionally, a 2021 study by Media Action Nepal found that out of 49,051 news articles surveyed, 1,817 contained false or misleading information.Ownership and influenceUnderstanding the commercial and political interests that may influence media content, including recognising when content is sponsored or influenced by advertisers or special interests, is another indicator of media literacy. This, too, is low among the majority of the audience. However, social activists, media professionals, educators, businesspersons and other professionals understand this dynamic. Anecdotal evidence from my conversation with them in several parts of the country reveals that some individuals actively cross-check information from local FM stations, as they can readily identify which stations are supportive to which political parties.Formats and genresAn important aspect of media literacy involves distinguishing between various types of media content, such as news, entertainment, advertising and opinion pieces and understanding the conventions and purposes of each. Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with this distinction. For instance, there are cases where people mistake a reputable news channel for an unfamiliar YouTube channel or perceive personal social media posts from journalists as official news from their respective organisations. This confusion extends to content creators, the audience cannot tell non-professional producers from professionals. The emergence of television personalities and journalists as YouTubers has led to further confusion, with their content being taken for official programming from their former television networks.Awareness about the unique aspects of digital media, including issues related to online privacy, security, digital footprints and the spread of misinformation online, is also minimal in Nepal. Access to digital security training and tools for media outlets and content producers in Nepal is limited, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. Moreover, most people lack awareness about the ethical responsibilities of media producers and consumers, including privacy, consent, intellectual property and the impact of media consumption on individuals and society.Media literacy effortsDespite the government's lack of prioritisation of media literacy, a few government institutions and non-governmental organisations have taken steps to strengthen it. For instance, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has initiated media literacy programmes mostly tailored to journalists. The Press Council Nepal (PCN) conducts interactive programmes on digital literacy that align with its objectives. Certain municipalities have also organised media skills training programmes that incorporate media literacy. Moreover, political parties and local governments have launched initiatives to guide their members on effective media relations. Furthermore, secondary school curricula include topics such as media introduction, the importance of communication, media and entertainment, information technology, digital technology, and cyber-security. These efforts collectively contribute to bolstering media literacy across various sectors of society.It is necessary to enhance media literacy in Nepal by integrating media literacy initiatives into the legislative framework and the national plan of action, including the periodic plan. Education and training programmes on media literacy must go beyond the circle of journalists. Moreover, it is imperative to promote critical thinking skills among media consumers via targeted programmes in partnership with academic institutions, government entities and civil society organisations. \nFederalism in Nepal is alive and kicking. Eight-and-a-half years after the new constitution institutionalised a three-tier federal state, the provinces, the second tier, neither have police forces of their own nor can they employ their own civil servants. Whenever there is a change of government in Kathmandu, or even a change in coalition partners for that matter, the provincial governments too are invariably rocked. Oh, and when folks in other provinces face some problem, they have to troop all the way to Kathmandu for redress. Sugarcane farmers have repeatedly made the long march from various districts in the Tarai-Madhesh in order to demand a decent price for their produce. The same is the case with the 22-member Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign team that is currently marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu. Their goal is to garner the national government’s attention on the destruction of the Chure region, a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Natural water sources originating at the foothills of Chure have been drying up in the past few years, and the first layer of underground water has been severely depleted in much of the Tarai. The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, resulting in an acute water crisis. The campaigners have a 12-point charter of demands, including strong action against forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. Last year, the campaign had undertaken a similar march to Kathmandu demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business hub in Madhesh Province. The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor. The campaigners had met many high-ranking government officers and ministers in Kathmandu. But nothing happened. The country’s most eco-sensitive region is being devastated by illegal deforestation and sand-mining and millions of people are having to scrounge for water. Yet the authorities, both at the federal and provincial levels, seem unbothered. One big reason the old unitary state was replaced by a federal setup was so that the fruits of development could trickle down to the lowest rungs of the society, and the voices of people at the grassroots could be heard and addressed without delay. Yet what we see is that the same criminal-political nexus that benefitted the most from the old structure continues to dominate the federal state as well. In many cases, the illegal miners and deforestors active in the Chure region would have funded the election campaigns of (current) federal and provincial lawmakers, getting in return the licence to do pretty much as they please. People at the grassroots meanwhile have to beg with the authorities just to drink some clean water. Apparently, the more things change in Nepal, which has long been under the sway of a corrupt elite, the more they stay the same.  \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to force through a vote of trust on Monday despite protests from the main opposition, the Nepali Congress, has further deepened the divide in Nepali politics.The ruling coalition and the opposition parties are already in a bitter disagreement over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe the alleged involvement of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane in the misuse of cooperative funds.According to leaders from both ruling and opposition parties, the manner in which the floor test was conducted in the House of Representatives on Monday is unlikely to ease tensions soon. The rancour is expected to continue until at least the budget announcement day on May 28.If the Congress and five other opposition parties continue to obstruct the House, the government could bring the budget through an ordinance or by using marshals in the same manner Prime Minister Dahal sought a vote of confidence on Monday, say political observers. Amid sloganeering and protest by Congress lawmakers on Monday, Speaker Devraj Ghimire deployed marshals to allow the prime minister to seek a vote of confidence. Soon after Speaker Ghimire announced the commencement of House proceedings, Congress lawmakers surrounded the well and chanted slogans demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the home minister’s alleged involvement in the cooperatives scam. The prime minister then rushed to the rostrum and started speaking, seeking a vote of confidence, and even threatening the Congress of consequences for trying to disrupt the proceedings.“I think you [Nepali Congress] have made a big mistake today. I am that prime minister, who, time and again, helped you in the past, who is working to bring you into the dialogue and consensus. But today, you have set a bad example by preventing that prime minister from seeking a constitutionally-mandated vote of confidence, and I express my deep sadness at your move. This will cost you dearly,” the prime minister said while asking lawmakers to extend their trust in him. The prime minister received 157 votes in the 275-member House of Representatives. One member abstained, while none voted against the motion. This was his fourth vote of trust after being elected to the post of prime minister in December 2022.When asked by reporters what he meant by the cost for the Congress, the prime minister said the Congress will face the consequences in the next general elections.After the prime minister secured the vote of confidence despite the opposition’s protest, Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress, raised serious questions about the conduct of Speaker Ghimire. “The Speaker fortified the House like a barrack and allowed the prime minister to seek a vote of trust, which is a joke in parliamentary democracy,” said Lekhak, adding “The Speaker acted like a loyal party worker.”“Today, the Speaker did not allow the opposition party to speak in Parliament. It is because of the arrogance of the parliamentary majority. This is a tyranny and clearly shows the government’s disregard for parliamentary democracy,” said Lekhak.A Nepali Congress office-bearer said the party would harden its position in the coming days and unite all opposition parties against the government. According to a statement issued by the party, the Congress has called for a joint meeting of its central working committee and parliamentary party for Wednesday to discuss the latest political situation and chart out a future course.“Did you forget who brought you into the peaceful politics from the jungle?” Lekhak asked the prime minister in response to the prime minister’s statement that Congress has to pay a huge price.“When you took up arms to change the regime, who brought you to the peace process? Please stop making such irresponsible statements…what irresponsible utterances are you making? The Nepali Congress has to pay the price—what price?” a visibly angry Lekhak said.The Congress has been obstructing the House of Representatives seeking the formation of a parliamentary probe committee against Home Minister Lamichhane. After repeated meetings and backdoor negotiations, the ruling and opposition parties on Saturday agreed to form a parliamentary committee but differed over its terms of reference (ToR). The ruling and opposition parties also formed a task force to fix the committee’s terms of reference, but despite hectic negotiations throughout Sunday, they failed to reach an understanding. The Congress and other opposition parties were demanding that the parliamentary committee should probe the home minister. But the biggest party in the ruling coalition, CPN-UML, and Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, have been dismissing the demand for an exclusive probe into the home minister. On Sunday, the opposition parties, who are now united under the leadership of the Congress, allowed the home minister to speak in the House, something Lamichhane had long been asking for. Lamichhane, while addressing the House, made many unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders. Following Lamichhane’s statement, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa organised a press conference and challenged the home minister to prove the accusations levelled against him and the Congress party. The accusations and counter-accusations between the Congress and Lamichhane have greatly diminished the chances of forming a parliamentary committee.Lekhak said after the parliamentary party meeting of the Congress on Monday morning, the party had decided to draw the prime minister’s attention to Lamichhane’s ‘unjustified’ statement in the House. He accused the home minister of trying to evade the probe and said the accusations Lamichhane made in the House should be taken seriously. “The home minister was uncivilised and violent during his statement,” said Lekhak. Even a ruling party questioned the need for a trust vote at a time when the main opposition had been staging protests inside the House.“We gave a vote of trust to the prime minister as we are still in the government. But we wonder why the prime minister was in such a rush to seek a vote of confidence,” said Rajendra Pandey of the CPN (Unified Socialist). The prime minister had decided to seek a vote of confidence after the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, one of the parties backing the government, withdrew its support last week. The prime minister can seek a vote of confidence within 30 days after a ruling partner party withdraws support. Besides Thapa, Lamichhane’s accusation was challenged by Nepali Congress Vice-president Dhan Raj Gurung, and chairman of the Rastriya Janamorcha, Chitra Bahadur KC. Gurung has registered a complaint with Speaker Ghimire and asked for action against Lamichhane for ‘contempt of a parliamentarian’. Lamichhane had accused Gurung of misusing a diplomatic passport. But Gurung said the Supreme Court had already given him a clean chit in the case of his alleged misuse of a diplomatic passport.More opposition parties joined the protest led by Congress in Parliament on Monday. “Speaker Ghimire did not present himself like a Speaker,” said Gyan Bahadur Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. “He acted more like a UML cadre. He has failed to perform his duty as Speaker.”“The Speaker made a blunder today by ignoring the Congress and other opposition parties who had rejected the trust vote. The Speaker acted with such force for the first time in Nepal’s parliamentary history,” said Shahi. Dahal had opted for a floor test for the first time on January 10, 2023, getting 268 votes. The prime minister won the trust motion for the second time three months later, after breaking ties with the UML and forging a new alliance with the Congress. This time, he secured the support of 172 lawmakers. He had to seek the vote of confidence for a third time after the Congress withdrew its support to the government. Dahal again broke the alliance with Congress and joined hands with the UML and other parties on March 4, to this time get 157 votes.Chief Whip of the UML Mahesh Bartula said that following its rowdy showing in the House on Monday, the Congress should stop calling itself a democratic party. “The anti-democratic nature of the Nepali Congress has been exposed today,” said Bartula. “It has now lost the right to call itself a democratic party.” \nIn his address to Parliament on Sunday, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane failed to clarify whether he was involved in the cooperatives fund misappropriation as accused by the main opposition party, the Nepali Congress, experts say.Instead of presenting any convincing evidence to prove the allegations wrong, Lamichhane tried to label counter-accusations against his accusers, they said.Congress has been obstructing Parliament proceedings since Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal changed the coalition partners on March 4 by breaking alliance with the Nepali Congress and bringing the CPN-UML onboard. Congress has been obstructing Parliament for the last two months, demanding the formation of a parliamentary committee to probe Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of cooperatives funds.Lamichhane and his former business partner, GB Rai, who has fled the country after the cooperatives controversy surfaced, are accused of rerouting the money from various cooperatives in Pokhara, Butwal and Chitwan to Gorkha Media Network to jointly run Galaxy 4k Television, which is now dysfunctional.Lamichhane, the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), had been seeking time to defend himself in the Parliament after Congress demanded that a parliamentary committee be formed to probe his involvement in the scam. Though he got the opportunity to speak after insisting on it for two months, experts say he failed to defend himself.In his speech, Lamichhane could not provide a clear answer as to why he wasn’t involved in the misappropriation of the cooperative funds, they say, adding that instead of addressing the questions raised against him, he raised other issues that would not prove him innocent.Som Bahadur Thapa, a former secretary of Parliament, said that Lamichhane was given the platform to clarify the charges against him but he couldn’t utilise that.“A programme presenter in television before joining politics in 2022, he definitely should have known what he was supposed to tell while addressing Parliament,” Thapa told the Post. “But, instead of answering the questions earnestly, he tried to ‘do politics’.”During his about 40-minute-long address in Parliament, Lamichhane fiercely attacked the Congress party and its leaders, accusing them of being involved in various scandals. Lamichhane particularly took aim at Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa and other senior party leaders.In doing so, experts say, Lamichhane took the ‘whataboutery’ approach, which is a technique of responding to accusations or difficult questions by deflecting attention through counter-accusations or raising unrelated issues.Earlier, when he was questioned about his passport and citizenship, he had presented himself as flamboyantly as he did on Sunday. Last year in February, he lashed out at the media after he had to step down as the home minister. This time, he targeted leaders of the main opposition party.Political analyst Mumaram Khanal found the way Lamichhane presented himself in the Parliament something odd. The way he spoke is seldom expected in Parliament, said Khanal.“In parliamentary practice, the House always belongs to the opposition party, whereas the ruling parties are supposed to answer the queries they raise,” Khanal told the Post. “Lamichhane was supposed to answer the questions raised against him but he ended up being a reactionary, raising counter questions.”However, RSP leaders are not ready to accept Khanal’s argument. “Lamichhane just cited the earlier instances that had happened in Nepal, which cannot be undermined by labelling him reactionary,” Shiva Nepali, a RSP lawmaker, told the Post.Lawmaker Nepali claimed that Lamichhane was able to clarify the allegations against him. “The common citizens do not understand the political language, so he used the language they understand,” Nepali said.Meanwhile, Congress Vice President and Member of Parliament Dhan Raj Gurung submitted an application to Speaker Devraj Ghimire on Monday demanding action against Lamichhane for disrespecting Parliament.Gurung demanded that Home Minister Lamichhane be made accountable for contempt of Parliament for his baseless allegation against Congress lawmakers.“As per the regulation of Parliament under Rule 219, Home Minister Lamichhane failed to abide by the rules of Parliament,” Gurung said in his application.Meanwhile, the main opposition Congress has concluded that Lamichhane presented himself “in a violent manner” in Parliament on Sunday.Congress leaders on Monday condemned Lamichhane's presentation in the House of Representatives as rude, misleading, fabricated, and violent. Lamichhane, however, argued that he had done nothing wrong, citing past instances while addressing the House on Sunday. Speaking to the media at the Parliament premises on Monday, Lamichhane clarified that during his remarks, he merely cited media reports that named individuals in various cases in the past. \nLack of irrigation has forced farmers in Lumbini province to abandon the farming of spring paddy, one of the major sources of food grain.However, most farmers have switched to maize, as the use of superior hybrid seeds has boosted production and earnings compared to spring paddy.The area growing spring paddy (known as chaite dhan in Nepali) has been on a declining trend nationwide as the government has failed to keep its promises.The government had planned to expand the acreage of spring paddy by 200,000 hectares to 300,000 hectares in a bid to increase output and make the country self-reliant in food grain.Nepal has 1.44 million hectares of land suitable for growing paddy. However, spring paddy is grown on only 104,712 hectares.Spring paddy is planted in 35 districts between mid-March and mid-April. Plantation of this crop, however, is not common because it requires better irrigation. As a result, most cultivators prefer to grow paddy during summer when there is abundant rain. Despite low acreage, productivity of spring paddy is high, with harvests standing at 4.98 tonnes per hectare, as against 3.97 tonnes for regular summer paddy.In Lumbini province, spring paddy was transplanted on 3,038 hectares last fiscal year, which has shrunk to 2,677 hectares in the current fiscal year. Bardiya, one of the top spring paddy-producing districts in Lumbini province, has seen the area shrink to 1,201 hectares from 1,450 hectares in the last fiscal year.Except for Rolpa and Rukum, spring paddy is cultivated in all districts of Lumbini province. Spring paddy production areas in Palpa have dwindled to 630 hectares this fiscal year from 700 hectares last year. The area in Gulmi has been reduced to 319 hectares from 340 hectares.In Arghakhanchi, the area has declined to 170 hectares from 200 hectares last year. The area in Rupandehi has declined to 54 hectares from 60 hectares in the last fiscal year, and the Kapilvastu spring paddy-producing area has halved to five hectares this fiscal year.According to the Lumbini Province Agriculture Development Directorate, however, the area under spring paddy in some districts has increased marginally.It has increased from 40 hectares to 55 hectares in Pyuthan and from 5 hectares to 7 hectares in Nawalparasi.Similarly, in Dang, the spring paddy area increased marginally to 200 hectares from 198 hectares. In Banke, it has increased to 36 hectares from 35 hectares.According to government officials, in the 10 districts of Lumbini province, Chaite-2, Chaite-4, Chaite-6, Hardinath-I, and Bindeshwari are some of the paddy varieties planted during the spring.“The decline in the production area is mainly due to the lack of farm hands in the villages,” said Ram Prasad Pandey, chief of Lumbini Province Agriculture Development Directorate.“As there is no attraction in farming, it has prompted a massive out-migration. Youths are leaving their hometowns to better jobs abroad in droves.”He said that in southern Tarai, the cost of production of spring paddy is high as most farmers irrigate their land using electric pumps.Similarly, experts say that spring paddy is not the choice for consumption, particularly in urban areas, due to its large and thick grain. The demand for fine and long-grain rice varieties, however, has been increasing exponentially. But these varieties are not produced on a commercial scale in Nepal.Palpa, Gulmi, Arghakhanchi, Pyuthan, Kaligandaki, Badikhola, Ridi Khola, Mathura and other areas were once popular for spring paddy as the terraced fields used to be covered with paddy during the March-May period. The youth from the hills are either leaving Nepal or to bigger cities in the country. As earnings from other professions are higher compared to agriculture, experts say the future of farming in western Nepal looks bleak. As spring paddy farming has been declining, the provincial government has been conducting programmes to attract the farmers. The decline in spring paddy area is mainly due to a lack of sufficient irrigation. The existing irrigation projects are out of order, and farmers cannot afford the repair and maintenance. Pumping water with electricity costs a lot, farmers say.Agriculture experts, however, say though spring paddy areas have shrunk, the spring maize farming acreage has been increasing in recent times. “The production of maize is increasing in the Tarai compared to spring paddy,” said Pandey. Experts say that most farmers grow hybrid maize. The use of superior hybrid seeds has boosted production, and farmers have switched from paddy to maize nowadays, said Pandey. \nChairman of Kantipur Media Group Kailash Sirohiya on Tuesday said Kantipur Media Group will never compromise on its editorial independence and responsibilities.On Tuesday, Dhanusha District Court issued an arrest warrant against Sirohiya over a ‘citizenship-related issue’.In a statement, Sirohiya said the arrest warrant was issued with the intent of blackmailing Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue of cooperative frauds.“It is the media’s responsibility to raise voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” said Sirohiya. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.” Sirohiya asserted that Kantipur will not back down even an inch from raising its voice against the wrongdoings in the society, including on the cooperatives scam.“The office bearers who abuse their authority and misuse police administration to exact vengeance against the chairman of a media house based on the news they publish should also answer when there will be an investigation into the individual who came to power through political bargaining that entailed getting the Attorney General to certify that he would not be prosecuted for holding dual passports,” he said.Sirohiya said he is ready to cooperate in every investigation conducted as per the law. \nNepali Congress lawmakers have objected to the arrest warrant against Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya, saying that it was issued at the behest of those in power. The lawmakers said that the warrant came as an attack on the press and an assault on democracy.They visited the KMG’s central office at Thapathali, Kathmandu, and expressed their firm resolve to defend press freedom and democracy in the country.Congress lawmaker NP Saud, who is a former foreign minister, said they will not tolerate the crackdown targeting an independent media organisation. “We stand with Kantipur. This is an attempt at intimidation under the influence of power. It is an attack on democratic values and press freedom,” said Saud.Congress lawmaker Rajendra Bajgain questioned: “What is the prime minister trying to achieve by attacking Kantipur, which has fought for democracy?”Lawmaker Bir Bahadur Balayar emphasised the need for broad unity in response to not just any actions against Sirohiya but also against democracy and press freedom.Lawmaker Pratima Gautam said the warrant came as a bid to divert the issue of cooperative fraud. “We stand with Kantipur for democracy and press freedom,” she expressed her solidarity. MP Raju Thapa accused Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of attempting to bargain with the media and retaliating when he did not succesed. “The home minister should be arrested in the cooperatives [savings misappropriation] case,” he said.Lamichhane faces allegations of investing hundreds of millions of rupees illegally borrowed from a number of cooperatives into the now shuttered Galaxy TV when he steered the company.Lawmaker Chanda Chaudhary, at the Kantipur office, said they stand with Kantipur as it raises issues of public concern.Lawmaker Deepak Giri highlighted the contribution of Kantipur media outlets to democracy. “The government is trying to scare the Kantipur. There is a need to protest and retaliate against the attempt to intimidate the media organisation by filing fake cases,” he said.Lawmaker Kusum Thapa Magar condemned the crackdown on the dissemination of fair news against the cooperatives fraud, while Congress leader Govinda Pokharel said the arrest warrant against Sirohiya was a step against democracy. Also speaking, lawmaker Ram Krishna Yadav said Kantipur had made contributed significant to safeguarding democracy.MP Shyam Ghimire described the arrest warrant as an attack on democracy, adding that the incident should be taken seriously.Lawmaker Nagina Yadav slammed the government for displaying arrogance in Parliament and the home minister for its approach to the Kantipur daily in particular. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal took the vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on Monday amid protest by the main opposition, Nepali Congress.Meanwhile, industrialist Upendra Mahato demanded an impartial investigation into the issue.Thanking the lawmakers for expressing solidarity with him, KMG Chairman Sirohiya renewed his commitment to fighting corruption and irregularities and supporting democracy as the media’s duty towards the public.Sirohiya said he was ready to assist the administration in the investigation and termed the issuance of the arrest warrant without questioning him a retaliatory move. He demanded an impartial investigation against the home minister as well in the citizenship case.“He [Rabi Lamichhane] should also be investigated for holding two citizenships. The investigation against me should also be impartial and transparent. I am ready to cooperate,” he said. \nPolice on Tuesday arrested Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya.A police team, including Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai and Superintendent of Police Rabindra Regmi of Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office, arrested Sirohiya from the Thapathali-based central office of the media group.Police arrested Sirohiya without questioning him on a complaint filed at the Dhanusha District Police Office.The arrest follows a series of news reports carried out by KMG’s outlets on the cooperative scam. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane is accused of misappropriating millions of rupees deposited in various cooperatives in several cities. Talking to the media briefly after his arrest, Sirohiya said the government showed authoritarian characteristics [by arresting him] despite his willingness to assist in the investigation.Sirohiya also described his arrest as a blow to press freedom. “This is an assault on press freedom, and I will fight until the end,” he said.Earlier today, Sirohiya said he was ready to cooperate in every investigation conducted as per the law. In a statement, Sirohiya said the arrest warrant was issued to blackmail Kantipur daily into not publishing more reports on cooperative frauds.“It is the media’s responsibility to raise voice and demand justice and fair investigation into all those involved in the embezzlement of the hard-earned savings of more than 7.1 million depositors in various cooperatives,” Sirohiya said. “There is no doubt that the filing of the complaint and the issuance of the arrest warrant against me without any interrogation has been done to blackmail Kantipur into not publishing more reports on the issue and to divert attention.”Sirohiya asserted that Kantipur will not back down even an inch from raising its voice against the wrongdoings in the society, including on the cooperatives scam.“The office bearers who abuse their authority and misuse police administration to exact vengeance against the chairman of a media house based on the news they publish should also answer when there will be an investigation into the individual who came to power through political bargaining that entailed getting the Attorney General to certify that he would not be prosecuted for holding dual passports,” Sirohiya said. \nHome Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Tuesday committed a gross abuse of his authority by sending Nepal Police to have Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which publishes The Kathmandu Post, arrested. Sirohiya was at work as police officers barged into his office at the KMG headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu.We have no objection with law enforcement officers fulfilling their duty as per the law of the land, and are committed to fully supporting the state in an impartial investigation on the alleged discrepancies in Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate. However, we are also cognisant of the politics of vendetta being pursued against Sirohiya by Home Minister Lamichhane, who has been riled by the consistent, fact-based reporting of Kantipur, our sister publication, on his alleged involvement in cooperative frauds.Coming on the heels of the persistent calls for a parliamentary probe into his alleged frauds, Lamichhane has made no secrets about his intention to play the politics of vendetta against the KMG. This is not the first time Lamichhane has launched an attack against the group. Over a year ago, as he struggled to salvage his image in the wake of the case against dual citizenship, Lamichhane opened a barrage of unsubstantiated allegations against KMG. That Lamichhane has a grudge against the group for fulfilling its duty of fearless, factual reporting is thus well-documented.But the home minister’s action against KMG should not be taken as a singular event. It is, rather, an attack on press freedom through the misuse of state machinery, and it is going to set a dangerous precedent. It is ironic that Lamichhane, a former mediaperson, has taken an authoritarian approach of punishing another mediaperson for unfavourable reporting about him. In having Sirohiya arrested, Lamichhane has exposed his undemocratic credentials as a politician.Sirohiya’s arrest takes us back to the early 2000s, when press freedom was at an awfully low point. In 2001, the then government had arrested Kantipur Publication publishers Kailash Sirohiya and Binod Raj Gyawali as well as Kantipur Editor-In-Chief Yubraj Ghimire on the grounds of publishing an opinion article that it considered “objectionable”. Later, in 2005, when King Gyanendra Shah imposed dictatorial rule, he sent the country's army and police forces to the newsrooms of Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, along with dozens of other newsrooms in the Kathmandu valley and elsewhere in the country to ensure that no negative news about the government could be published. Over almost three decades of its service to the nation, the private media houses in Nepal, with Kantipur Publications at its head, have repeatedly stood up to injustices and defended the rights of the citizens—and they will continue to report on corruption cases such as the one the home minister is embroiled in. The politics of vendetta and fear has never worked in favour of authoritarian regimes, and it will not work this time around. The Nepali media has never bowed down to the politics of fear and, rest assured, we will continue to fulfil our duty of informing the citizens without fear or favour.  \nAfter weeks of uncertainty, things had started to appear a touch clearer from Saturday evening. A meeting of top leaders from major political parties—both ruling and opposition ones—agreed to end the House deadlock by forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam with links to Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane. The leaders formed a taskforce of four second-rung leaders to prepare terms of reference for the probe panel. While defining the jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee, the task force member from Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party even became ready to list the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane had allegedly received money. Whether to specifically mention Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction remained the major bone of contention and the members were trying to find a meeting point. In the meantime, the main opposition Nepali Congress became ready to allow Home Minister Lamichhane to address the House. For weeks, Lamichhane had been arguing that it was injustice to bar him from speaking in Parliament, thus depriving him of a chance at clarification. As per the understanding, Lamichhane addressed the House. Unfortunately, Lamichhane presented himself in an utterly irresponsible way, spending most of his time slinging mud at opposition lawmakers, and the Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa in particular—in fact at all those who were asking for a probe against him. He threw caution to the wind and tore parliamentary decorum to shreds. Had he presented himself in a responsible way and had he really wanted to use the opportunity to clear the old deadlock, his Sunday’s speech in the House could have been a turning point. Alas! It was just the opposite. He further provoked the opposition and spoiled the situation that was headed in a positive direction. The crux of his over half-an-hour-long lecture was that “if you all [leaders from opposition parties] have for so many years engaged in various wrongdoings, why should I be punished for following the same corrupt path?” He disappointed many of those who reckoned that the main opposition was doing Lamichhane injustice by depriving him of a chance to speak out on the allegations leveled against him. Instead of explaining his case based on facts, figures and documents, he threatened to reopen old cases in which opposition leaders were allegedly involved. While issuing such threats, he seemed to forget that he is the home minister who can immediately order law enforcement agencies to investigate and take actions against those involved in such crimes, including those publishing ‘baseless’ news against him. In doing so, he not only disappointed his followers but also, perhaps inadvertently, suggested that the country’s home minister is helpless to act while all kinds of grave crimes are happening all around him. Leaders often engage in heated arguments in the House. But someone in Lamichhane’s position—deputy prime minister, home minister and chair of the fourth largest parliamentary party—is expected to exercise a minimum level of restraint. When they speak from the Parliament’s rostrum, they not only address other lawmakers in the hall but also millions of people in and outside the country. Lamichhane went way beyond that red line on Sunday. His no-holds-barred speech is not the kind of precedent the holders of highest offices in the country should be setting.    \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nNepal, despite minimal greenhouse gas emissions, faces severe climate change impacts due to its vulnerability, with local governments playing a crucial role in minimizing vulnerability and building community resilience, but facing challenges in implementation due to capacity issues and insufficient resource mobilization.\nMourners gather in Tabriz for President Ebrahim Raisi and others killed in a helicopter crash, amid a deepening crisis in Iran's clerical leadership.\nAn emergency landing in Bangkok by a Singapore Airlines flight from London resulted in one fatality and multiple injuries due to severe turbulence.\nTaiwanese parliamentarians engaged in a chaotic dispute over opposition-led parliament oversight reforms, sparking protests and accusations of Chinese influence.\nPoland detained nine suspects for sabotage on behalf of Russian services, targeting the country due to its role in supplying Ukraine.\nIn 'Guilty or Not Guilty,' a murder mystery play, the audience plays the jury, determining the fate of a femme fatale accused of murdering her wealthy lover, with secrets and biases influencing their verdict.\nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nClimate change has profound impacts on Nepal’s economy, particularly on agriculture, water resources, and biodiversity, according to the latest survey report.The National Climate Change Survey 2022, the second of its kind, was released by the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics. It paints a stark picture of Nepal's climate change situation and urges necessary intervention for the resource-crunch Himalayan nation.According to the survey, the economic losses in farm and off-farm in the last five years, as reported by households, excluding significant infrastructure damages, amounted to Rs415.44 billion.Experts say worse is yet to come.In Nepal, the number of households unaware of the consequences of climate change is significantly high.The survey shows that many households reported adverse weather changes. They noted that their water resources dried up, new diseases infected crops, productivity losses rose, and flowering and fruiting behaviours changed over the last two and a half decades. Major economic sectors and essential services like health and education in Nepal have felt the repercussions of extreme weather events linked to climate change, the survey said.The statistics office said the sampling used the total number of households from the population census. In total, 6.66 million individual households were included in the frame. The survey was conducted through face-to-face interviews from July to March 2023 among 6,508 households in 326 primary sampling units, encompassing all seven provinces. The statistics office said all the respondents were at least 45 years old and had lived in the survey area for 25 years, forming the sampling frame that included households meeting these criteria across Nepal.According to the survey, over the past 25 years, approximately 50 percent of households reported the emergence of new diseases in their crops, 53.9 percent observed the presence of new insects or pests affecting their crops, and 29.8 percent of households noted the appearance of new diseases in their livestock.Nepal’s agriculture sector is the mainstay of the country’s economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs over half of the population. The sector is mainly rainfed and heavily dependent on rainfall.When the rain fails to fall, the GDP takes a tumble. This dependence makes the country particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. Rural areas experienced more new diseases affecting crops (55.9 percent) than urban areas (45.6 percent). The mountain region (68.7 percent), hill region (50.3 percent), and Tarai region (46.3 percent) also experienced an impact on crops due to new diseases. The survey report shows households in altitudes between 1,500 and 2,000 metres reported emergingnew crop diseases (60.2 percent) over the last 25 years. This shows diverse factors influence the prevalence of crop diseases across diverse geographical and climatic domains.“The situation is alarming,” said Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office.“The survey was intended to see people’s perception towards climate change, the most burning issue globally,” he said. Climate change literacy among people, mostly in rural areas, is shallow, but some exciting facts exist. “Most of the farmers surveyed are not clear whether climate change is bringing diseases and low yields, but at the same time, they have a coping mechanism knowingly or unknowingly,” said Regmi. For instance, farmers have changed the cropping pattern. “If they think rainfall will be below normal or drought, they switch to another crop.”The survey shows that 35.8 percent of the households surveyed were aware of climate change. Across all three geographical domains, the number of households unaware of climate change is significantly high, with the highest number being in the mountain region (70.9 percent). The sex-disaggregated data indicate that most male (61.3 precent) and female (74 percent) respondents were unaware of climate change impacts.The accessibility of early warning information among the people is weak.In urban municipalities, 16.3 percent of households received early-warning information, while 83.7 percent of the respondents did not receive any information regarding a disaster occurring shortly. Altitude-wise, households in low-altitude regions have received more early-warning information than those in the higher-altitude areas. The survey results show a significant impact of climate change on Nepal's water resources over the last 25 years. Climate change has notable implications for the country's energy transition, as it is actively pursuing a shift from conventional fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources. According to experts, the survey report is eye-opening. Nepal plans to generate 30,000MW of electricity by 2035, and the market for Nepal's hydropower is opening up in India and Bangladesh.Many households reported adverse changes and noted their water resources dried up. This phenomenon was observed across all domains and indicates a nationwide decrease in water availability. Respondents experienced a reduction in ground and surface water, primarily attributed to insufficient rainfall and increased drought incidents. According to the survey, 78.3 percent of households observed a decline in rivulets and streams, and 55 percent observed a decrease in wells, springs, and stone spouts. Likewise, 47.7 percent observed changes in water resources due to insufficient rainfall, followed by an increase in drought (20.3 percent), road construction (3.4 percent), deforestation and urbanisation (3.2 percent). In contrast, minimal respondents observed change due to population growth, earthquakes and landslides/soil erosion over the last 25 years.The survey said that over the past 25 years, Nepal has suffered from various natural disasters. Drought has emerged as a major disaster, affecting 44.87 percent households, and floods 13.87 percent. Storms have affected 9.9 percent of households, while landslides have affected 7.81 percent. Drought has been reported as the major disaster, affecting 65.4 percent of households, followed by diseases/insects at 54.3 percent, storms 46.2 percent, hailstorms 32.6 percent, floods 28.5 percent, cold waves 21.7 percent, landslides 21.5 percent, and inundation 17.5 percent. Thunderstorms impacted 15.7 percent of households, while occurrences of other disasters such as avalanches, GLOFs, and snowstorms were relatively lower. Climate change has significant and wide-ranging impacts on biodiversity in Nepal, a country known for its rich and diverse ecosystems, including the Himalayan mountains, tropical forests, and wetlands. Ten percent of households reported changes in flowering and fruiting behaviours affecting trees, shrubs, and fruiting plants, leading to reduced production and altered taste. Some of the critical impacts of climate change on biodiversity in Nepal are shifts in species distribution, habitat loss and fragmentation, altered breeding and migration patterns, invasive species, loss of endemic species, biodiversity conservation challenges, and human-wildlife conflict.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nBright blue bookshelves, a sunny courtyard, and a friendly librarian—Junkiri: The Feminist Library is a vibrant and welcoming communal space located in Dhokatole, Kathmandu. Currently, it houses more than 2,500 books and has over 700 members.This library is an initiative of VOW (Voices of Women) Media that aims to increase feminist education by providing easy access to feminist literature, tools and resources to women and girls.The library initially opened on March 8, 2020, but unfortunately, due to lockdown, it had to close down just two weeks later, on March 23. However, in August 2022, the library resumed its operations, welcoming readers back once again.Libraries have never been a neutral space. They have always, in some ways, reflected the various biases, values and power structures of their communities. Not only is there a bias in the selection of library material, but there is also a bias in cataloguing and categorisation. Most notably, the Decimal Dewy System is known to have significant biases against marginalised communities. For example, pregnancy, quite outrageously, is categorised in the disease section through this system. Historically, male authors have dominated intellectual life, which is why it is so crucial to amplify the voices of women through literature and libraries that promote works written by women. Education is a site for social change and transformation, and access to feminist education is crucial in increasing feminist consciousness. In Nepal, the urgency for a feminist library is greater than ever. While progress has been made in areas such as legal reforms and women’s representation in politics, it is still difficult for many people to understand basic concepts like consent and recognition when a minor has been groomed. The victim-blaming culture has also significantly hindered progress.A feminist library serves as a beacon of change against society’s regressions that disproportionately look down on women. Junkiri, as well as VOW media, have played pivotal roles in promoting feminist pedagogy. As a free library, they promote a collaborative and participatory learning environment that values personal narratives. As a community, Junkiri not only educates young girls on topics like consent and raises awareness on feminist issues but also serves as a supportive and guiding community for its members.The library’s collection is divided into three sections: children, young adults, and adults. The children’s section features bright, colourful, and engaging graphic books that educate children about essential topics such as consent, diversity, and empathy. The young adult and adult sections also feature a diverse range of literature, including novels, research books and a selection of queer literature. At first, the library relied on door-to-door marketing around its community to secure members, but it has since expanded through word of mouth. Jenisha Niroula, a library member, says, “I love going to Junkiri because of its jolly environment, especially when they organise children’s reading circles, encouraging young minds to read. I also find many books from female writers that I cannot find elsewhere.” The library organises a reading circle featuring various children's books with around 15-20 children in the community. This fosters a reading culture and helps children bond over books.Junkiri recently organised a Feminist Writing Workshop, encouraging participants to adopt a feminist perspective in their reading analysis and writing. Sam, a library member and a workshop participant, says, “I loved the workshop experience. It was helpful to learn about the ways of critiquing articles and practising writing as a feminist. I also love spending time in the library because of its welcoming librarian and reading space at such a low price.”“A communal space where children of different class groups inter-mingle is becoming increasingly important to foster empathy and bring down the divide between the rich and poor,” says Pooja Panta, the founder of VOW Media. The lack of community spaces in Kathmandu has brought about numerous challenges, and Junkiri plays a crucial role in filling this void by not only offering a communal space but also by supporting feminist literature and amplifying the voices of female and queer authors.Junkiri also serves as an archive. Editions of decade-old Asmita Magazine stored in a box can transport readers into various times in Nepali history when feminists tirelessly advocated for rights and articulated their challenges. “It is sometimes sad to think how very little has changed, and the challenges that women face have remained the same,” says Shashikala Khadka, the librarian.Books and magazines from various time periods serve as valuable resources for young feminists. They offer insights into the nuanced challenges faced by feminists throughout history. By studying these materials, they can better understand their role in disseminating feminist knowledge in the present day.“The best thing about Junkiri is that I don’t have to explain my beliefs as it is a safe space that promotes sisterhood and supports women,” says the librarian. She also recounts instances of individuals on Twitter who resist the feminist movement in general. “Being a feminist has become increasingly villainised, with its meaning being twisted, leading many people to hesitate in identifying with the term,” she adds.Shashikala also helps curate the library. Initially, the books were sourced from donations, but the library has recently begun purchasing to add to its collection. She also stresses the need for more Nepali graphic novels for children and Nepali novels for young adults.“Change is a relay race, it does not happen overnight, but you have to lay the groundwork for the future generation to carry it forward,” Shashikala emphasises.Junkiri is changing existing structures to improve access to feminist resources and information. It stands as the go-to destination for readers seeking thought-provoking literary works while also fostering a community centred on sisterhood and empathy.Junkiri is open Tuesday through Friday (1:00 p.m. to 6:30 p.m.) and Saturday (10:30 a.m. to 6:30 p.m.). The membership fee is Rs100. \nWho hasn’t created a quirky one-liner and wanted to put it on a T-shirt? And if the t-shirt bit isn’t an option, when someone thinks of something clever, it might go straight to their social media. The impulse to share our thoughts and feelings and seek validation for them pervades human nature; we can’t help it—because don’t we all like a bit of attention at heart?In Siddhartha Art Gallery’s latest exhibition, “Sawari Kathahru: Art in Motion,” witty phrases found on trucks, along with the desire to share them with the world, are on full display. This exhibition celebrates 'truck poetry' and shayaris adorning vehicles, showcasing the humour and creativity of the drivers who compose these verses and the artists who bring them to life.This multimedia exhibition includes a documentary entitled ‘Literature on Wheels’ by Urza Acharya, the gallery’s media coordinator. It features photographs by writer Sravasti Ghosh and Abushan Gautam, a journalist based in London and illustrations by graphic designer Shubha Joshi. Additionally, visitors can engage with interviews featuring truck drivers, available on loop through headphones, and enjoy an intriguing table game.Various sections of photographs that labelled religion, love, and politics show how these one-liners span various genres. Browsing through the photographs of trucks adorned with various wit, humour, highs, and lows is a delightful experience; each image is bound to elicit a giggle. My favourite is ‘Kancha, Love Ma Dhoka Khanu Bhanda Aau, Mero Bike Pachadi Basera Ktm Ko Dhulo Khau.’This roughly translates to; Come, sit on my bike because it’s better to inhale Kathmandu’s dust than to be deceived in love. However, beneath the surface of humour and wit, keen viewers will notice something intriguing: the truck art and poems serve as an unofficial archive, reflecting the evolution of the country’s politics, religious practices and social interactions. While frequent travellers on Nepal’s roads are familiar with this unique form of expression, viewing the various images together makes viewers contemplate its evolution over the years. Take, for instance, the increasing appearance of Balen Shah in truck art, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City—a testament to his political popularity. Political discussions such as those concerning the ‘Greater Nepal’ map are also popular subjects in truck art. While truck art mostly reflects the consciousness, opinions and feelings of individual drivers, collectively, it also mirrors the prevailing ideas, opinions and perspectives within our country. The documentary ‘Literature on Wheels’ is an interesting glimpse into the world of truck art. Its quirky, upbeat music and font directly mirror the uplifting and unserious mood of truck shayaris and truck poems. This documentary provides a behind-the-scenes look, interviewing drivers and artists to uncover how truck art is conceived and applied. The documentary is heartwarming. While watching it, I couldn’t help but feel that, deep down, we are all poets driven by an innate need to share our emotions and artistic expressions with the world. It left me with a profound appreciation for the universal human inclination towards artistry, regardless of our backgrounds or occupations.There is a table game in the exhibition that adds to the fun while you appreciate truck art as you browse through the photographs. It is an immersive game that encourages you to make your poem. While I may have lingered a bit too long on this aspect—letting my quirkiness shine through—I wouldn't be surprised if you find yourself spending an extended period here as well, fully immersed in the fun and creativity it offers. Despite the exhibition’s many strengths, I couldn’t help but notice that, in some ways, it feels disjointed. I believe it might not be ready to fully embrace its status as a multimedia exploration. While all the exhibition components share the common theme of illuminating Nepali truck art, the absence of a cohesive narrative or overarching framework seems to cause the multimedia effort to falter.Individually, each component of the exhibition shines brightly. I couldn’t shake the feeling that a unifying storyline or thematic thread connecting all the experiences would have made the exhibition more engaging and immersive.The interview presented in headphones on a loop is somewhat confusing because of its non-linearity. This aspect could be improved by replacing it with musical shayaris playing on a loop instead. This adjustment would better align with the exhibition’s goal of fostering an appreciation for poetry and art than the current interview format.Making a point that says truck art, often viewed as gaudy, deserves appreciation by framing them in an art exhibition, while well-intentioned, may not fully convey the intended message and could be perceived as slightly disconnected from the exhibition's overall theme. Perhaps considering additional approaches, such as including more in-depth interviews in a video format with drivers and artists, could have better highlighted the significance of appreciating truck art within the context of the exhibition.This exhibition highlights the often-overlooked art surrounding us daily and validates its significance. I am looking forward to this exhibition and all its components continuing to develop and evolve, perhaps with the addition of a captivating storyline or poetic symbolism. It would be wonderful to see a longer documentary and a wider selection of photographs that delve into the stories of the drivers and artists behind this art form.To truly stand out, this exhibition can provide more than just a compilation of truck poetry. I believe it requires something deeper, something more profound. After all, truck poetry is readily visible outside; offering additional evocative elements would have enhanced the art exhibition experience. With a more cohesive approach, I believe this concept has the potential to become an even more enriching experience.  \nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nThe parliamentary meeting on Thursday that was expected to end the ongoing impasse ended up in a scuffle between the ruling and opposition lawmakers.The House meeting called for 11 in the morning was postponed until 4 pm in an attempt to find a meeting point among the parties over the formation of a parliamentary panel to probe Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s embezzlement of cooperatives funds. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal himself had held meetings with ruling parties and also the main opposition Nepali Congress to find a way out. However, the ruling parties and the Congress couldn’t agree on terms of reference of the parliamentary probe committee.The ruling parties agreed to constitute the parliamentary panel to investigate the embezzlement of savings in the cooperatives and recommend action against the individuals, institutions and companies benefited illegally. However, the Congress wanted the probe focused on Rabi Lamichhane, erstwhile managing director at the Gorkha Media Network, and others who illegally benefited from Supreme, Suryadarshan, and Swarnalaxmi, among other cooperatives. The ruling parties, particularly Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), did not agree to the proposal to focus only on the cooperatives where Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Lamichhane is allegedly involved. “Our demand is to constitute a parliamentary committee to investigate the problems facing the cooperative sector, including Rabi Lamichhane’s involvement in the alleged fraud. The ruling alliance is not ready for it. It wants a panel that will broadly investigate the problems in the sector without addressing our concerns. The alliance is trying to divert attention from the main issue,” said Prakash Sharan Mahat, the Nepali Congress spokesperson explaining why there could be no agreement.The ruling parties, however, say the Congress, guided by a mala fide intent, has been insisting on an investigation committee focusing on three or four cooperatives. “We had just demands: first, our chairperson must be allowed to clarify on the allegations in Parliament. Second, as problems have been seen in several cooperatives, there must be a broader investigation,” said Manish Jha, an RSP lawmaker. “Why just focus on three or four cooperatives? Why not probe the cooperatives that are led by Congress leaders?”The meeting of the House of Representatives postponed for 4 pm was held two hours later. No sooner had the meeting commenced, the Congress started chanting slogans. Amid the obstruction, Speaker Devraj Ghimire read out the letters from the President’s Office regarding the authentication of a bill and addition of ministers from the newly formed Janata Samajbadi Party. The situation got tense when Ghimire asked Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and address the meeting amid the protest of the main opposition.The Congress lawmakers had already gathered at the well and were raising slogans demanding a parliamentary probe into Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling funds of several credit cooperatives.After the Speaker allowed the minister to go to the rostrum, the Congress lawmakers and senior CPN-UML leaders, who were on the front row of the ruling bench, engaged in heated verbal exchanges. The situation escalated after UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Congress vice president Dhanraj Gurung engaged in an intense argument. Other lawmakers from the two sides subsequently joined the resulting scuffle. Even Prime Minister Dahal and Minister for Communications and Information Technology Rekha Sharma engaged in an argument with the Congress lawmakers.Both sides have pointed fingers at each other for the tensions. “The situation escalated after the Congress lawmakers tried to stand in front of the rows designated for the ruling parties in order to prevent Home Minister Lamichhane from heading to the rostrum,” said Sharma. “The Congress is responsible for the unparliamentary behaviour.” The UML has demanded an apology from the Congress, claiming its lawmakers misbehaved with Oli.The Congress, however, said the Speaker’s irresponsible move [of inviting the home minister to the rostrum] was responsible for the unpleasant incident in the House. “The Speaker is guided by partisan interests. It was wrong of him to invite the home minister to address the House when the opposition was obstructing the House,” said Mahat. The next House meeting has been called for 11 am Friday.Earlier, the meeting of the National Assembly was also adjourned until 1:15 pm on Friday following obstruction from the Nepali Congress.The main opposition has been obstructing the budget session of Parliament since the first day of the session that commenced on May 10. However, the opposition parties had allowed the President to table the government’s policies and programmes. The RSP has said they will not agree to any probe panel targeting its chairperson. “The probe panel will be formed only if there is an agreement to investigate the Congress President [Sher Bahadur Deuba] and his son,” said Jha. “To challenge our party, those who have been in power for decades need to come clean.” \nNepal’s two biggest parties are making scathing criticism of each other.Senior coalition partner CPN-UML and the main opposition Nepali Congress, which is the largest party in the House of Representatives, have trained their guns on each other over the recent Supreme Court verdict on a multi-billion-rupee land swap scam.After the Supreme Court on May 12 issued the full text of its verdict related to the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, at the prime location of Birtamod in Jhapa, the Congress demanded an investigation into those involved in making the decision on the land swap.Terming the court verdict as historic, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa posted a statement on social media on Tuesday, saying: “It has now been proven that the then government’s decision was wrong … Therefore, there should be further investigation against those involved.”The Supreme Court on February 7 overturned the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government's decision. On April 26, 2021, the Oli-led government allowed the use of the land exempting the ceiling for the deal. However, the constitutional bench, headed by Bishowambar Prasad Shrestha, ruled that Oli’s Cabinet decision contravened Section 12 (C) of the Land Act 1964 and was immature.The court also ruled against allowing the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding the legal ownership ceiling in any other place within Koshi Province, highlighting the legal implications of the land reforms.The requirement to first examine the specific land’s detailed area has been upheld by the Supreme Court’s constitutional bench in the full text of the verdict. The land that is being considered for a swap ought to yield comparable value, read the court’s final verdict. But the tea estate is trying to swap its land in Birtamod, reportedly valued at Rs200 million per bigha, with low-price land in Prithvinagar, Jhapa.While considering a swap, there must be a feasibility study to assess the new location’s production capacity. Technical experts’ advice ought to be followed in this context, reads the full text of the court.“It [the court verdict] has not just confirmed how wrong and corrupt the decisions and law amendments made by the government of the time were, but has also exposed policy-level corruption. There is no longer any doubt that such a decision is unfair and ill-intended. Therefore, further investigation is warranted,” Thapa wrote. When the Congress general secretary tried to bash the UML over the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate incident, UML chair Oli accused the Congress of selling 70 bighas of the estate in return for hefty commissions. Oli made the accusation while addressing the parliamentary party meeting of the UML on Wednesday. “The Congress should be careful when commenting on the UML on the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate,” Oli said. “They once sold 51 bighas of land and later 19 bighas in the name of land swapping, just for commissions.”When the government in 2018 tried to swap the Giri Bandhu land, the court stopped it, saying there were no legal provisions to do so. “Abiding by the court’s ruling, we later formulated the law, but the court now has found the fault with it,” Oli said.The Congress has been cornering Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane over his involvement in the co-operatives funds’ embezzlement. With this agenda the party also has been disrupting Parliament. But the ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being biassed against Lamichhane. And it is Oli and his CPN-UML party that has come to Lamichhane’s most resolute defence.The Congress parliamentary party meeting on Tuesday decided to take up the issue of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in a serious manner.But Congress leaders deny that bringing up the tea estate issue is its calculated strategy to corner the ruling parties. “The parliamentary party meeting decided to take up this issue given the gravity of the matter. There is no ulterior motive,” Sanjay Gautam, a Congress lawmaker, told the Post. Meanwhile, Gautam also said the party will study Oli’s allegations against his party. When the Oli government amended laws related to land-swapping, Thapa of the Congress, who demanded an investigation into the Oli Cabinet’s decision, was a House member. Not only Thapa but most senior Congress leaders were members of Parliament at the time of the amendment.“Though one can question those involved in the law amendment on moral grounds, they cannot be held accountable on legal grounds,” Om Parkash Aryal, an advocate who was among those challenging the Oli government’s decision in the court, told the Post. “In such instances, it’s the government that makes such a decision which comes under the question.”King Mahendra’s implementation of land reforms in 2021 BS, through enacting the Land Act 2021 BS, was a momentous step. The law fixed the ceiling of land possession by individuals at 28 bighas in Tarai districts. The land exceeding the ceiling would be nationalised. Landlords close to the then royal palace were taken into confidence for the law’s implementation, and the palace made it clear that land used for industrial and agricultural purposes would not be nationalised.According to Section 12 of the Land Act 2021, land used for industrial, agricultural, cooperative farming, educational, or medical purposes is not put under the limit.Budhkaran Rajbanshi, a landlord in Jhapa considered close to the royal palace, was informed in prior that if he established a tea estate, the land beyond the ceiling would not be nationalised.To save his land, he founded the Budhkaran Tea Estate there. Three additional Jhapa landlords, the Giri brothers (Prem Kumar Giri, Krishna Kumar Giri, and Trilochan Giri) also received similar information. In Birtamod, Jhapa, the Giri brothers owned 500 bighas. Before the Land Reforms Act came into effect, the Giri brothers proceeded to register the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate in order to safeguard the property. Land reform laws introduced later did not apply to the land as it had already been used for agricultural purposes. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nTwo people were injured when a fire engulfed a carpet factory in Changunarayan Municipality-2 in Bhaktapur district on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Rajan Karki of Bhaktapur Police Range said Buddha Narayan Shrestha, 23, of Ramechhap and Indian national, 29-year-old Manu Urwa, were injured while attempting to contain the fire.Shrestha is undergoing treatment at the Bhaktapur-based Iwamura Memorial Hospital while the Indian national, who has sustained serious burn injuries, has been taken to the Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre, Kirtipur.The fire was brought under control in five hours with the help of seven fire engines, four water tankers, security personnel and locals.DSP Karki said the fire gutted property worth Rs18 million, adding the cause of the fire is yet to be ascertained. \n\nA man, who was injured while putting out a fire at Tapeshwar community forest in Godawari Municipality-4, Badikhel, succumbed to burn injuries on Tuesday.According to Senior Superintended of Police Shekhar Khanal of Lalitpur District Police Range, Shankar Pahari died while undergoing treatment at the Kirtipur-based Nepal Cleft and Burn Centre.Another injured, Ramesh Pahari, is being treated at the hospital.Meanwhile, a fire at Ananda forest in Godawari Municipality-6, Lele is yet to be brought under control. A total of 65 patients have been moved to a safer place after the fire spread to the premises of the Anandaban Hospital. \nGlobal Dairy Private Limited has started commercial production of butter milk, known as mohi in Nepali.Mohi, known as mattha in Hindi, a popular fermented dairy drink originating in the Indian subcontinent, is the liquid left behind after churning butter out of cultured cream. The dairy plant in Imilia in ward 9 of Buddhabhumi Municipality in Kapilvastu district has been producing 1,000 litres of mohi daily since mid-April. The company said the demand for the drink, a good source of protein and calcium, has been growing.In Nepal, it is consumed especially during the summer. The producer said that traditionally the drink used to be a favourite in villages, but gradually lost its appeal to more popular beverages like Coca-Cola and Pepsi.“That is why we have started the production and branding of mohi,” said Thaneshwor Neupane, chairman of Global Dairy. “We are the first Nepali company to start the commercial production of bottled mohi and label it. We have introduced the product in the market with attractive packaging.”The company has expanded sales and distribution to six districts of Lumbini province. “This is our first phase of expansion. We have planned to go across Nepal,” said Neupane.The brand, ‘Buddhabhumi’, is named after the birthplace of Buddha. Shankar Pandey, finance chief of the company, said that the drinks give energy and refresh people. The retail price is Rs50 per litre bottle. The dairy factory said it has spent Rs15 on each bottle and its labelling, bringing the total cost to Rs38-40 per bottle, Pandey said.“We have given special focus to maintaining the standard and purity of mohi.”Mohi is made from curd recommended by the food technologist. First, the substance that turns milk into curd is tested. After that, the acidic and potential hydrogen levels are tested, and mohi is made only from consumable curd.The curd is then mixed with processed water in a machine until it reaches the right consistency for bottling. The finished product is packaged in sets of 12 bottles and is sent to the market based on demand.“Bottling is also nice, and the taste is also good,” said Punaram Aryal, a consumer from Imilia.The company said 28,000 litres of mohi have been sold so far since its production started last week. The mohi produced is consumable within 5-6 days from the date of manufacture.According to locals, mohi has become a great option to other cold beverages produced by multinational companies. “Public response to the product is positive and this has encouraged us,” Neupane said.The factory currently has been producing 3,000 litres of mohi daily, Neupane said.Rajendra Singh Lodh, a food technologist, said special attention has been given to the purity and quality of the product.In Ayurveda, the traditional system of Indian medicine, it is also said that drinking mohi after meals makes the body healthy and active. Daily consumption of mohi boosts immunity and improves the digestive system, according to food technologists.Mohi is rich in potassium, calcium, and protein. It also gives the body freshness and hydrates it.Drinking mohi is also considered beneficial for people fighting long-term diseases.Global Dairy, which has been operating for a decade, has started producing mohi as a new product, with an investment of Rs500 million. The company, which has been producing 50,000 litres of milk daily, said it is planning to increase the capacity to 100,000 litres.It aims to produce powdered milk too.“If the marketing of mohi goes well, then it will also be a boon for dairy farmers who often face milk holidays,” said dairy farmer Shiva Gulam Kori of Budhhabhmi municipality.The company has 79 collection centres in Lumbini province and two in Sudurpaschim province, and it has 15,000 farmers associated with it. It sells dairy products by coordinating with around 500 collection centres across the province. The company has provided direct employment to 200 people.Dr Mukesh Chaudhary, the medical chief of Kapilvastu Hospital, said that mohi is more beneficial to health compared to other cold drinks. “It is important to drink mohi for vitamins D and calcium. It hydrates the body and balances the body's temperature.”    \nCimex Inc Pvt Ltd, the authorised distributor of BYD Auto Industry Co Ltd in Nepal, achieved a milestone by delivering 50 units of cutting-edge BYD electric vehicles (EVs) in a single day. The company said that on May 18, it sold 50 BYD EVs from its service centre at Guheshwari, Kathmandu. The event, filled with excitement and anticipation, witnessed the delivery of BYD ATTO 3 and BYD Dolphin EVs to eager customers, signalling a paradigm shift towards sustainable and eco-friendly transportation solutions in Nepal, the company said in a statement. In a gesture of commitment to customer satisfaction and safety, Cimex Inc Pvt Ltd also introduced the first generation BYD e6, dating back to 2017, as a dedicated roadside assistance vehicle during the handover event. This initiative underscores Cimex's unwavering dedication to providing comprehensive support and services to BYD EV owners, ensuring a seamless and enjoyable driving experience. \nInternet service providers say they are awaiting the full text of the Supreme Court’s ruling to pay the taxes they raised from the public.The service providers (ISPs) raised nearly Rs4 billion in rural telecommunications development fees and royalty charges on maintenance from the public since the fiscal year 2017-18 but did not transfer the amount to the government.The ISPs have been arguing that the former parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had ordered the fees’ waiver.On May 13, the top court scrapped the writ petition filed by Worldlink Communications and ordered the ISPs to pay the government taxes that they had raised from the public.“We will obey the Supreme Court’s verdict. As the writ petition has been scrapped, we are discussing with the Nepal Telecommunications Authority on the amount that ISPs owe to the government and the payment modality,” said Binay Bohra, owner of the Vianet internet service provider.The tug-of-war between the ISPs and the government deprived thousands of people of the service when the Indian vendor on which the ISPs rely for the Internet bandwidth suddenly severed the link for hours.On May 2, Airtel, a leading telecom provider of India, cut upstream services to Nepal after the dispute between the government and ISPs over the payment dispute remained unresolved for months. The disruption started at around 5 pm and the services were restored after around five hours.According to the Internet Service Providers Association of Nepal, Airtel provides around 70 percent of upstream services to Nepal.Airtel agreed to restore the service after the Nepal Telecommunications Authority, the regulator, promised to sort out the payment issue ‘responsibly.’For nearly two years, the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology has reiterated that unless the ISPs pay the due taxes, it will not recommend the foreign exchange to be made available by the Nepal Rastra Bank to the service providers so they can forward the payment to upstream service providers.The ISPs have not paid the charges as the erstwhile parliamentary Public Accounts Committee had a few years ago ordered the government to exempt them from taxes on non-telecom components like web service, co-location, hosted service, disaster recovery, managed service, data centre, and cloud service.Following the order, in a letter dated July 15, 2018, the licensing department of Nepal Telecommunication Authority wrote to the Inland Revenue Department requesting that internet service providers not be subjected to telecommunication charges for non-telecommunication services.The committee said that internet service providers do not have to pay royalties and Rural Telecommunications Development Fund charges for three fiscal years: 2017-18, 2018-19, and 2019-20.But the auditor general brought the issue to light.Nepal's constitutional supreme audit body pointed out that such fees, which the ISPs have raised from the public, should not be waived and instructed recovery of the charges. Following this, the government wrote to the ISPs to clear the dues.The current Public Accounts Committee has ordered the government to recover the dues from the ISPs.Nepali ISPs owe Airtel more than $30 million (Rs4.3 billion). They defaulted on payments for upstream services a year ago.The Indian vendors also threatened to suspend services starting January 1 this year if Nepali ISPs failed to settle the outstanding dues. However, following a change in government, the issue remains unresolved.The ISPs’ annual transactions near Rs27 billion, with the government earning more than Rs9 billion in revenue under eight headers.Around 10.6 million people use the internet in Nepal through 20 ISPs in the country, including the state-owned Nepal Telecom. ISPs say they provide direct employment to more than 15,000 people. \nOver 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 will be inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) during a nationwide immunisation drive starting next Sunday.Officials said, children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.“All necessary preparations regarding IPV vaccination to the children deprived of the vaccine are being completed,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The vaccine will be administered in schools, booths and health posts.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nAs India reports an outbreak of West Nile virus, Nepal’s Ministry of Health and Population said it has been assessing the risk of the deadly disease in the country.Nepal is facing a high risk of several vector-borne diseases, including the outbreak of West Nile fever, due to rising temperatures, looming monsoon, the presence of virus-spreading vectors in the country, and free movement of people between the two countries, officials said.“We are aware of the outbreak of West Nile fever in India,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “International Health Regulations also require us to increase our vigilance against the disease.”West Nile virus is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted to humans and animals through the bite of an infected Culex mosquito. The same vector also spreads elephantiasis or filariasis and Japanese encephalitis.Experts say mosquitoes become infected after feeding on infected birds, especially crows. When the infected mosquitoes bite humans and animals, they spread the virus, which can cause neurological problems and death in infected persons. India has reported a death from the West Nile virus in Kerala and six other cases of infections in Thrissur, Malappuram and Kozhikode districts in recent days. Ojha said that Nepal is a member state of the World Health Organisation and receives every alert issued under the International Health Regulations. “Nepal is in the high-risk zone for an outbreak of the West Nile Virus due to its climate, presence of virus spreading vector, and mobility of people to and from the high-risk zones,” said Ojha. At least two cases of West Nile Virus infection were reported in a study carried out in Nepal in 2009-2010. Of 2,046 serum samples tested to examine the virus, two samples contained fragments of the genome resembling virus lineage 1.Experts say there is no specific treatment for West Nile virus. They suggest drinking plenty of water and fluids, resting, and taking medicine for fever in mild cases. “Those experiencing severe headache, high fever, weakness and confusion should see the doctor at the earliest,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “As mosquito breeding season has started, one should also take precautions to avoid mosquito bites.”Nepal is one of the most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis, as multiple studies have pointed out. The United Nations’s report “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases affected by climate drivers have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also reveals that the warming climate has caused the Anopheles, Culex, and Aedes mosquitos to move to altitudes above 2,000 metres in Nepal. This shift in their distribution has serious implications, as over 100 species of Anopheles transmit malaria, more than 950 species of Aedes spread diseases like dengue, chikungunya, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile virus, and over 1,000 species of Culex transmit Japanese encephalitis, filariasis, and West Nile virus.Vector-borne diseases, or VBDs, are spread by carriers like mosquitoes, sandflies, kissing bugs, and ticks. The report says that viruses like dengue, chikungunya, and Japanese encephalitis are emerging in Nepal's hilly and mountainous areas.Experts say frequent movement of people is also a reason diseases are detected in new areas. When disease vectors bite an infected person, they transmit the disease, and the vectors’ entire generation gets infected.The Ministry of Health has reported over 1,000 cases of dengue infection since January, this year. \nOver 600 people with respiratory illnesses seek care at the Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital on Tuesdays and Thursdays when the hospital runs its out-patient service. The number of patients suffering from respiratory illnesses—pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, among others—has risen significantly not only in this hospital but those across the country, according to health officials. “Polluted air is the chief culprit for the rapid surge in the number of respiratory illnesses,” said Dr Niraj Bam, an associate professor at the Institute of Medicine, Tribhuvan University. “Along with respiratory illness, the toxic air has led to severe conditions like ulcers, cancer of the lungs and intestine, kidney disease, heart complications, high blood pressure and stroke.”Of late, polluted air has been taking a huge toll on public health, throughout the globe.A new report published on Thursday in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal, states that polluted air and high blood pressure are leading contributors to the global disease burden. The report, “Global Burden and Strength of Evidence for 88 Risk Factors in 204 Countries and 811 Subnational Locations, 1990–2021: A Systematic Analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2021,” shows that air pollution was the leading contributor to the global disease burden in 2021, making for eight percent of total disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), followed by high blood pressure (7.8 percent).Likewise, smoking accounted for 5.7 percent, low birth weight and short gestation 5.6 percent and diabetes 5.4 percent of the burden.Low birth weight, short gestation and unsafe water, sanitation, and handwashing (WaSH) were among the leading risk factors for the younger population up to 14 years, while for older age groups, metabolic risks such as high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), high blood sugar and high low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol had a greater impact.Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis. Doctors say particulate matter emitted from construction sites, wildfires, wood burning, agriculture activities, and dusty roads worsens air quality, threatening the health of hundreds of thousands of people across the country.Most forests burn every year during the dry season. Vehicular and industrial emissions and the burning of agricultural residue make the air toxic.A recent report by Save the Children also shows critical linkages between air pollution and multi-faceted hazards for children.The report “Breathless Future: Unveiling the Impacts of Air Pollution on Children and Women in Kathmandu and Saptari” shows the systemic impact of air pollution on various aspects of children's lives. It also explores the effects of air pollution on women and underrepresented groups.“Deteriorating air quality, outdoors and indoors, has exposed children and women to many health hazards—asthma, other lung conditions, coughing, skin disease, nausea, and headache,” reads the report. “Alarmingly, these conditions have led to increased cases of pregnancy loss, child organ underdevelopment, and a general decline in life expectancy.”Studies carried out in the past show that polluted air has been shortening people’s lives. Nepali lives are being cut short by around five years, according to a report by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI), which converts air pollution concentration into an impact on life expectancy. AQLI is a metric produced by the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago.Toxic air is deadlier than tobacco use and high blood pressure, which reduce life by 2.8 years and 1.7 years, respectively.The reduction in life expectancy depends on where one lives—7.5 years in Mahottari, 7.4 years in Rautahat and Dhanusha, and 7.2 years in Sarlahi and Bara districts, the AQLI report said. Likewise, the pollution has been shaving 6.7 years off the lives of people residing in Siraha, and 6.2 years in Saptari and Rupandehi districts.Environment experts in Nepal said that worsening air quality has not only affected people’s health but also hit the economy and hindered overall development. Polluted air has for long been taking a huge toll on public health in Nepal but what’s alarming is that the authorities have not taken the issue seriously.“We heard the government’s policies and programmes. There is no mention of the issue of air pollution,” said Bhusan Tuladhar, an environmental expert. “How can we mitigate the effects of air pollution, without addressing the problem?” \nNineteen-year-old Amit, who’s currently in his gap year, started vaping two years ago. He says he isn’t addicted to it—he barely experienced any withdrawal syndrome when he quit it last year, before picking it up again. Amit, who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym to protect his privacy, says he vapes just because he wants to.Unlike Amit, Rita (name changed), who is 21, switched to vaping after smoking tobacco for a while. Rita says that since she hopes to quit smoking altogether, she doesn’t mind the Nepal government’s intention to put a blanket ban on e-cigarettes. But doctors say a ban may lead those who smoke vape to switch to smoking tobacco again.As debates continue around the world about the pros and cons of vaping compared to smoking tobacco, the Nepal government earlier this month announced that it was banning e-cigarettes. The National Health Education, Information, and Communication Center (NHEICC), under the Department of Health Services, says it is seeking help from other ministries to enforce the ban. While some vape users the Post talked to said that the ban would help them quit smoking altogether, there are other aspects of the ban that need a more careful consideration for youths’ health, experts say.Meanwhile, some other users said banning vapes makes little sense as tobacco cigarettes are still freely available in the market for people of all age groups. If the government is so concerned about youths’ health, they question, shouldn’t stricter measures be taken to ensure that minors, for instance, don’t purchase cigarettes?Nepal is not the only country to ban e-cigarettes of late. Most recently, the British prime minister announced a ban on all disposable cigarettes, citing risks to youth health following a significant rise in vaping.There are 33 countries that have altogether banned the sale of Electronic Nicotine Delivery Systems (ENDS), while according to a WHO report published in early 2024, around 74 countries have no regulations on the sale of e-cigarettes.Most countries in the world have a legal age to purchase traditional cigarettes, according to the WHO, while 88 countries have no minimum age limit to buy e-cigarettes.Moreover, the WHO has repeatedly urged countries around the globe to reduce the spread of e-cigarettes. A call to action was published in December last year, urging governments to strengthen regulations on e-cigarettes.Nepal, meanwhile, has no regulations on e-cigarettes. While they haven’t banned e-cigarettes outright, countries like China have imposed a number of regulations, including licensing to sell the products publicly, ban on flavoured products, and imposition of taxes.In a study on the prevalence of e-cigarette usage among undergraduate students in Kathmandu, 21.2 percent respondents said they never used e-cigarettes, while five percent said they currently used cigarettes. An estimation of global e-cigarette use put the number of its users at 82 million worldwide, 14.2 million of them in South Asia.Most countries cite e-cigarettes as a contributor to youth smoking.Nepalis do not need to produce an ID to purchase either tobacco cigarettes or e-cigarettes. Amit, for instance, was still a minor when he started vaping. That these harmful products are freely available to people of all age groups goes against the Tobacco Products (Control and Regulatory) Act, 2068 (2011), which says that it is illegal to sell tobacco products to those below the age of 18.“A stricter control on the sale of tobacco products is essential to curb smoking among youths,” says Dr Bhakta Bahadur KC, chief of Health Promotion and Tobacco Control at NHEICC. KC adds that to prevent minors and pregnant women, who are more vulnerable to the risks of smoking, from purchasing cigarettes, local governments should introduce provisions on licensing. “This is one way to control smoking in vulnerable groups,” says KC.Moreover, banning e-cigarettes fully may not be possible as they are widely sold through social media and smuggled products might still be available for purchase online. The NHEICC is currently calling on other ministries, including the Ministry of Information and Technology, and the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies, to help it ban e-cigarettes as they are imported from foreign markets.“Right now, the NHEICC is focused on banning e-cigarettes as a whole due to its adverse effects on the health of young adults, and its role as a gateway to tobacco smoking,” KC says.But Dr Augraj Uprety, Doctor of Medicine at the BPKIHS Department of Pulmonary Critical Care and Sleep Medicine in Dharan, provides a different perspective. With the ban on vapes, youths may find themselves attracted to tobacco smoking, as a significant number of vape users, like Rita, turn to e-cigarettes, supposedly to protect themselves from the harmful impacts of tobacco cigarettes.“Banning e-cigarette is not a cure-all,” Uprety says. “It is also vital to focus on handling the nicotine-dependence syndrome which both tobacco and e-cigarette users experience.”Both tobacco cigarettes and e-cigarettes contain nicotine, a highly addictive chemical, but tobacco cigarettes contain higher amounts of toxic chemicals than e-cigarettes. But studies show that e-cigarettes are especially harmful for youths as they affect adolescent brain development due to exposure to nicotine, and the aerosol in e-cigarettes has known effects on lungs.Further, there is little knowledge about the long-term impacts of e-cigarettes as it’s a relatively new technology.“I will never say banning e-cigarettes is a bad thing. It is an important move,” Uprety says. “But we also need to conduct a pilot study to figure out the repercussions of a potential ban.” \nAs pre-monsoon rains pick up pace, concerns mount about an imminent outbreak of the dengue disease. All that is required for the disease to flare up are stagnant water and hot temperatures, both already present in various parts of the country.“Dengue vectors are already there in many places across the country,” said Professor Murari Das, an entomologist at the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences. “With the right conditions like water and warmth required for vector breeding available now, we can expect a spike in dengue cases in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division said that 57 districts, including three districts of Kathmandu Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur—have already reported cases of dengue infection.“On average, around 50 people across the country are becoming infected with the dengue virus every week,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the division. “The number could rise in the coming days, as pre-monsoon rainfall activities have recently increased.”Post-monsoon is considered a high transmission season for dengue, but Nepal has witnessed outbreaks of the deadly disease throughout the year, making the country endemic to the virus.Around 1,000 people have already been infected with the deadly disease since the start of 2024, according to officials.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of people infected with the deadly virus do not show any symptoms. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and do not need treatment or can be treated with paracetamol at home.Last year, at least 20 persons died and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts. In 2022, a total of 88 people died and over 54,000 were infected by the virus throughout the country. At the time, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients and pharmacies had run out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Experts say that this is the right time to prepare and prevent possible outbreaks in the coming days.They say that it will be too late if they wait for a massive outbreak. Authorities concerned should launch an awareness drive, step up vector surveillance and take other measures to cut the risk, according to them. Health Ministry officials said that they have alerted all agencies concerned about the risk of a dengue outbreak.“We have alerted all relevant agencies about the risk of a dengue outbreak in the coming days,’ said Dahal. Authorities and agencies at some local units have started activities to make people aware of the risks, and we have urged all health agencies to take preventive measures, including launching an awareness drive.”Dengue has become endemic in Nepal, as cases of infection are reported throughout the year. Epidemiologists and virologists say the dengue virus has emerged as a major public health issue in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of people getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities are yet to take it seriously. They believe that this lackadaisical approach is responsible for the spread of the virus. What authorities concerned do most of the time is count the number of infections and deaths, according to them.They said measures such as search-and-destroy and awareness drives should be initiated to contain the spread of virus-spreading vectors.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nManchester City’s insatiable appetite for trophies spells bad news for any club hoping to break the stranglehold Pep Guardiola’s side continue to have on English football.Admirably, Arsenal pushed them very close this season but once again the sight of Guardiola’s players cavorting with the Premier League trophy was the abiding image of the final day.City’s 3-1 victory over West Ham United on Sunday took them to a place not even the great Liverpool side of the 1980s and Manchester United team of the late 1990s and 2000s inhabited.A fourth successive English league title is unprecedented and the big question is who will stop the City march.They have averaged 89.7 points in their last four title-winning seasons and, while Guardiola’s side again failed to threaten the 100 they amassed in 2017-2018, City proved that when the pressure is really on they are almost impregnable.Arsenal and Liverpool both headed City in the standings in the final months of the campaign, but the champions put together a blistering run of 19 wins and four draws since their last league defeat by Aston Villa on December 6.No one was really surprised because in 53-year-old Guardiola City have a manager obsessed with perfection.“It’s a bit demanding at times. It’s tough, but look what he’s done. He demands a lot every single day,” City’s Norwegian goal machine Erling Haaland said of playing for Guardiola. “If you don’t live up to what he expects you have a big problem.”The Spaniard has now won the Premier League title six times in his eight seasons at The Etihad Stadium and perhaps the only glimmer of hope is that he might decide to follow Liverpool manager Juergen Klopp and step away.“The reality is I am closer to leaving than staying. We have talked with the club—my feeling is that I want to stay now. I will stay next season and during the season we will talk,” the ex-Barcelona boss said. “But eight or nine years—we’ll see.”Incredibly, in the 152 Premier League matches City have played across the last four seasons, they have recorded 112 victories with just 17 defeats, racking up 372 goals.That is in a league regarded as the toughest in Europe, where the huge broadcasting deals mean all 20 clubs have the spending power to sign some of the world's best talent.“Pep Guardiola has designed a style of football that is being copied not just around this country, but all around Europe,” former Manchester United and England defender Gary Neville told Sky Sports.“Most of all he is a winning machine that instils that in everybody who works with him.”City’s Belgian midfielder Kevin de Bruyne, who along with 23-year-old Phil Foden now has six Premier League titles to his name with City, explained that the secret was quite simple.“The manager sets the tone but this team we enjoy playing with each other. It is not a team with big egos,” he said.“We play around with each other we run like crazy and we just enjoy it. The enjoyment is lasting so that’s it.”It could yet get better for City, with next Saturday’s FA Cup final against Manchester United still to come, and there will be no slackening off until another trophy is in the bag and a double secured, hot on the heels of last year’s treble. \nArmed Police Force Club women’s dominance continued in domestic cricket as they defeated Sudurpaschim Province by two runs in a thrilling final to win their fourth consecutive title at the Lalitpur Mayor Women’s T20 Championship at the TU Cricket Ground in Kirtipur on Saturday.APF have now won all four editions of the championship. They had entered the tournament as the winners of the Prime Minister Cup Women’s National T20 Cricket Tournament. APF have also terrorised the PM Cup winning six out of nine editions.For Sudurpaschim, they have now fallen short in the title match for a third time against APF after also reaching the final in 2021 and 2022. Koshi had reached the final in 2023.In fact, Sudurpaschim, who were chasing 153, almost ended APF’s stranglehold in the championship on Saturday when Kabita Joshi smashed three sixes in the 19th over to leave her side only needing six runs from the last over for a historic victory.Kabita Joshi played an unbeaten innings of 67 runs and Laxmi Saud made 29 not out to take Sudurpaschim from 49-5 in the seventh over to 150-5 (101-run partnership) before the final over, and inch closer to their first title.But the duo ran out of batteries when needed most as they could only manage three runs from the last over, thanks to a tight bowling from Rekha Rawal.Joshi’s 45-ball knock featured seven boundaries and three sixes.Captain Bindu Rawal contributed 19 off 17, while Sabitri Dhami made 12 off nine balls and Samjhana Khadka played 8-ball 10 for Sudurpaschim.Karuna Bhandari took 2-20 including the wicket of dangerous Khadka who had scored two fifties in this tournament.Earlier, APF opted to bat first and posted a big total of 155-4 with the help of half-centuries from openers Rajmati Airee and Sita Rana Magar.Airee scored 50 runs off 46 balls hitting seven fours. Captain Rana Magar cracked eight fours in her 55-ball 74. The opening duo also added 91 runs for the first wicket.National team skipper added nine, Roma Thapa contributed six and Mamta Chaudhary made 10 not out to guide APF to a huge total.Radhika Pujara, Bindu and Ritu Kanoujiya took one wicket apiece for Sudurpaschim. \nTribhuvan Army Club's Deepak Adhikari and Nepal Police Club's Rajpura Pachhai triumphed in the men's and women's half-marathons at the 2024 Kantipur Half Marathon, with Ramesh Khatri and Aaishwarya Kumal defending their wheelchair race titles.\nThe 12th annual Kantipur Half Marathon, with over 3,000 participants, commenced with Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal officially inaugurating the event.\nICC prosecutor requests arrest warrants for Israeli PM Netanyahu, Defense Minister Gallant, and three Hamas leaders for alleged war crimes and crimes against humanity in the Gaza conflict.\nNepal's book market is rife with unauthorized translations, including prominent works by Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin, despite laws against copyright infringement.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nWeather forecasts over the past several months have been failing—last winter was dry, and the expected rain in April/May, which would mark the beginning of the farming calendar, has been largely nominal. A few drizzles helped douse the wildfires that had engulfed large swaths in several districts but not nearly enough to build up soil moisture for summer crops. However, the drought made headlines for a different reason—especially when the wildfires worsened the already polluted air, making Kathmandu the most polluted city globally.Extreme weather events, including droughts, largely driven by global phenomena, have been wearying our opportunities and attempts to prosper. Key sectors like agriculture and hydropower, which Nepal banks on for economic growth, are severely impacted. Yet, the issue is not getting the attention it deserves at home. Extensive drought While our climate concerns remained focused on rising temperatures and the loss of snow deposits, Nepal’s National Climate Change Survey Report, published last Monday, unsurprisingly revealed that widespread droughts are the foremost climate stressors affecting Nepal, hitting its agriculture the hardest. A staggering 65 percent of households and their farms have been continually affected by droughts for the last 25 years. No wonder our farming is shrinking like never before. The report cited the dramatic increase in diseases and insects affecting crops as well. About 50 percent of the households surveyed reported the emergence of new diseases in crops, and an even greater percentage reported the presence of new insects/pests affecting food production.Consequently, fewer people are interested in farming; those who want to continue are being discouraged by these increased threats with no support whatsoever from the state. Alarmingly, the state fails to realise that if it doesn't extend meaningful and sustained support to tackle droughts, mainly in the hills, more people will be forced to quit farming—the direct repercussions of which will be a failure to meet the poverty and hunger goals of Agenda 2030. A drought-induced water shortage will also affect other goals such as health, gender, clean water and sanitation.The survey’s shocking figures regarding water sources, especially for the hilly regions, are extremely worrying, to say the least. Nearly all households in the hills and the mountains in Karnali Province experienced a decrease in water in the streams. Likewise, over two-thirds of households in Sudurpaschim and Karnali hills reported streams completely drying up. About 80 percent of respondents in the Koshi hills reported springs and kuwas drying up. The figure is around 75 percent for Karnali and Sudurpaschim hills. Half of all households in Sudurpaschim-Tarai and around 30 percent in Madhesh-Terai reported hand pumps completely parched. The survey found that almost half of all households have started using higher amounts of chemical fertilisers and improved seeds as adaptation measures. Water conservation, which would have helped address droughts, is practised by a mere 12 percent of the households, with only 2 percent relying on ponds to store rainwater—the sustainable and effective way to combat droughts. Drying local water sources do not simply affect a few people who depend on them to meet domestic and agricultural water needs; they are a visible sign of the changes that have been taking place over decades—something the water managers failed to notice. In fact, anecdotes tell us that people have been displaced by one or another water-induced disaster since the early 1960s. The only difference is that the number of people leaving their villages then was small, and most could find better opportunities in urban centres within the country. Now, thousands of youths wanting to leave their villages due to the same disasters that pushed others to migrate over half a century ago are searching for better opportunities that are no longer available in the country. The other extreme Despite droughts, the overall amount of annual rainfall hasn’t changed much, which points to the very interesting but disturbing rise of the other extreme—high-intensity rain causing damaging floods. The report indicates a changing flood scenario, especially in the hills and the mountains. Nearly 65 percent of the mountain households experienced floods capable of harming physical infrastructure in the last five years, while around half of all households experienced landslides of the same calibre. The hilly region is no exception—nearly 50 percent of the households in the hills were affected by damaging floods and almost 41 percent by landslides. We are starting to see the consequences too. In 2021, the floods in Melamchi, which drastically changed the river morphology, crippled the Melamchi Water Project, built over two decades to bring water to Kathmandu with a price tag of over Rs35 billion. Two years later, heavy rains and floods damaged the physical structures of 31 hydropower projects in eastern Nepal, with an estimated loss of over Rs8 billion. This is a firm reminder that as the drought conditions intensify, so do the risks of severe floods, which will have repercussions on the government’s plan to produce 30,000 MW by 2035 to meet both domestic and export needs. The nature of rainfall-induced floods in the mountain rivers, where large projects—especially hydropower plants—are built, are poorly understood and have become extremely unpredictable due to the shift in rainfall distribution. Short-duration high-intensity hill rains leave little time for advance warning or safety preparations.Troubling times aheadThe promising economic sectors have all been affected by a degradation of the foundation they depend upon—the state of the natural environment, which is undergoing changes at the core, largely connected by changing seasonal hydrology. Though the authorities and communities can collectively breathe a great sigh of relief as light rain in early May doused the wildfires and reduced the chances of their spread this year, we need to be reminded that the year 2023 was the hottest year on record; there’s no reason why 2024 and beyond won’t continue to break the record, especially with no letup in emissions. The resulting winter droughts in the years ahead are likely to be longer and more intense, along with the increased frequency of devastating floods. Droughts will continue to impact food production. Forest fires will continue to cover large areas as the factors that trigger them continue to build up and spread. However, we can and need to encourage as many households as possible to save monsoon rainwater in dugout ponds to help revive the lost or declining water sources. We cannot remain complacent and oblivious to how deep-rooted the problem has gotten.  \nElated after clearing the advocate licensing exam, a young lawyer—adorned in a new black suit and white shirt—walks into the Bar but is told to “be seated behind the furniture railing”. Dispirited, the person walks into a bar where the bartender says, “You can’t practice law here”. Both the Bar and the bar serve as metaphors here, but they are significant in understanding the challenges young lawyers face after years of formal education and passing the bar exams following admission to the Bar. While the Bar admits them, it does not adopt or foster them. The junior bar has always felt orphaned by the Bar; therefore, it most likely will once more renew its demand to the Nepal Bar Association (NBA) to redress the plight of young lawyers in the biennial jamboree of lawyers being held on May 17, 18 and 19.Conference of lawyersThe NBA brings together lawyers from all over Nepal for a three-day conference every two years. The biennial conference is distinct from the annual general meetings held every year. One unique feature of the NBA is that compared to some other professional associations, it disjoints the elections to choose office-bearers from the convention of lawyers. This year, the conference is centred around two themes. The first theme, “Competent Lawyers, Dignified Bar”, a trade union issue, corresponds to the NBA’s objective to increase the public’s confidence and esteem regarding law practice. The second theme, “Restructuring of the Judiciary”, aligns with the broader public interest concern to increase faith in the judiciary and enhance the independence of the court and judges. Between the two themes, there are no prizes for guessing that the first, although more important for the junior bar, will receive less consideration than the second. This is because the second theme carries with it constitutional overtones, which effortlessly capture the interest of the lawyers. Lawyers will take part in an expressive debate on a range of topics, such as the hierarchy of Bar and non-Bar judicial appointees, the rationale behind the representation of the Chief Justice in the Constitutional Council, the judiciary-executive balance in the Judicial Council, the necessity of parliamentary hearing of judges, and the judicial performance of the Constitutional Bench. The conference must furnish realistic proposals for constitutional amendments. After all, if the Bar is strengthened to protect the independence of the Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will, in turn, be able to protect the Constitution. Barring politicsA lawyer is entitled to be a supporter or member of a political party or hold a specific political belief. Political allegiance should not be a cause to target a lawyer, nor should it be a reason to debar or discourage them from building a practice. Lawyers’ political leanings and inclinations inherently attach them to politics. However, the political influence that people trained in law are able to exert in public affairs, because they occupy more than one-third share among the three state-political organs, inquires into the political affiliation of lawyers and their proclivities an inquisitive exercise. The election for the barkeepers of the NBA, which is held every three years, conducted by dividing the candidates into panels organised openly under the tutelage of political parties, exacerbates the politics of party division and polarisation. Therefore, the question confronting the NBA today is whether its members should “practise law” or “practise politics”. The answer is obvious: The NBA cannot be an apolitical organisation, but at the same time, the practice of law should come before the practice of politics for the members of the Bar. Hence, rather than prioritising party politics, the NBA’s primary focus should be on the welfare of lawyers, continuing legal education, increasing the professional competency of its members, meritorious (and also inclusive) standards for judicial elevations, accountability of the judges and their independence and, of course, guidance and counselling for young lawyers. If the NBA can notch significant achievements on these fronts, its elections structured in party lines might be considered excusable. A Bar Association co-opted by political parties will neither garner the public’s confidence nor encourage young lawyers to participate in the Bar’s politics. Raise the junior bar Let’s circle back to the initial topic concerning the young advocate entering the Bar. Earlier last month, the Nepal Bar Council allowed entry to approximately 950 lawyers, mostly young graduates. On the one hand, it is encouraging to see more and more students showing interest in studying law and starting a career in law each year. On the other hand, a shrinking economy, inadequate employment opportunities, uncertainty regarding the future of a legal career, and the allure to migrate abroad for better jobs and living prospects are a few factors that discourage young graduates from building legal practice.Although young law graduates acquire knowledge of law in law schools, they have little understanding of how to establish the practice of law. The intervention of the Bar becomes necessary here, especially to ease the transition for young graduates from law school knowledge to practical legal skills. For the Bar, the first task is to bring all the issues to the table and establish a connection with the latest crop of young lawyers to understand their needs and concerns. An institutionalised and active junior Bar section is positioned to fill the connection gap. The second task for the Bar, running a mentorship initiative to cultivate the professional skills of young lawyers, is far easier to conceive than execute. But there is always a place to begin. The Bar should applaud the law firms already recruiting young lawyers and providing them exposure to legal practice. In addition, the Bar has to take the initiative to create a platform to bring together different generations of lawyers for collaboration and knowledge exchange. Lastly, the Bar can leverage its relationship with other industry and professional associations to increase internship and job opportunities and hold career expos. Young lawyers are future leaders of the Bar but are also integral to the legal practice at present. The Bar cannot afford for them to fail. The NBA’s biennial conference should not be limited to a speech festival but should place young lawyers at the centre of its declarations. The responsibility of the Bar lies in ensuring that the graduates who passed out after taking the Bar examination do not pass-out from the legal profession.   \nMedia literacy empowers individuals to critically analyse the complex media landscape, enabling informed decision-making and fostering active societal participation. Unfortunately, the Government of Nepal, media houses, civil society organisations and media development organisations don’t prioritise it. As a result, media literacy is thinly referenced in our legislative framework. The Constitution of Nepal 2015 articulates the right to opinion and expression (Article 17[2a]), the right to communication (Article 19), and information (Article 27) while not mentioning the phrase. However, these provisions indirectly advocate for media literacy. Similarly, the National Mass Communications Policy 2016, without using the phrase, indirectly calls for actions promoting the same. For instance, Objective 1.1 of the National Mass Communications Policy seeks to create a civilised and prosperous society by ensuring accountable mass media based on democratic principles and the right to freedom of expression. This involves integrating media literacy through promoting access to diverse information sources and promoting critical thinking skills.Critical thinking The National Census of Nepal 2021 (2078 BS) records Nepal's literacy rate at 76.3 percent, with disparities in literacy levels among different geographic regions, castes, creeds and ethnicities. The literacy rate itself tells about the status of media literacy in Nepal.Most of the population tends to accept media information at face value, lacking the ability or inclination to analyse its content critically. A section of the population, comprising social activists, media workers, teachers, businesspersons and professionals, applies critical lenses to the media’s content. Various factors influence media content, including ownership, advertising, political ideology, philosophical inclinations, diversity of media workers, corporate interests and soft power dynamics. In research for his Master of Philosophy thesis, Govinda Dhital has written that headteachers in secondary schools demonstrate high levels of media literacy across seven dimensions: Access, retrieval, understanding, use/communication, analysis, evaluation and creativity.The audience's response and feedback to media content also serve as indicators of media literacy. However, this engagement seems to have diminished over the past decade. Interestingly, scandals and gossip about political leaders and celebrities and stories related to love, sex and failed social relationships still receive engagement from the audience, especially on social media. Notably, short, entertaining videos on platforms like TikTok often garner more interaction than in-depth investigative news reports despite the latter requiring significant resources and efforts to produce.Another indicator of the general population's critical awareness is the extent to which people file complaints about media performance. According to the Press Council Nepal’s database, 221 complaints were registered against the media in 2079-80 BS (2022-23), compared to 203 complaints registered in the PCN in 2078-79 BS (2021-22) and 192 in 2077-78 BS (2020-21).Evaluating content Most people find it challenging to evaluate the credibility and reliability of various media sources, a critical aspect of media literacy. Many are unaware of the potential biases or affiliations of media houses with corporate entities, power holders or the government. For instance, during the Covid-19 pandemic, individuals took health decisions based on misleading information, exemplifying the lack of source evaluation skills. This led to a surge in the acquisition of Vitamin D capsules, giloy (gurjo) herbs and turmeric.People also fail to understand media techniques like framing, editing and using language or images to manipulate or sway opinions, indicating a low level of media literacy. During the campaign for the 2022 parliamentary elections in Nepal, social media users disseminated doctored photographs of politicians and exploited out-of-context video clips to confuse voters. Additionally, a 2021 study by Media Action Nepal found that out of 49,051 news articles surveyed, 1,817 contained false or misleading information.Ownership and influenceUnderstanding the commercial and political interests that may influence media content, including recognising when content is sponsored or influenced by advertisers or special interests, is another indicator of media literacy. This, too, is low among the majority of the audience. However, social activists, media professionals, educators, businesspersons and other professionals understand this dynamic. Anecdotal evidence from my conversation with them in several parts of the country reveals that some individuals actively cross-check information from local FM stations, as they can readily identify which stations are supportive to which political parties.Formats and genresAn important aspect of media literacy involves distinguishing between various types of media content, such as news, entertainment, advertising and opinion pieces and understanding the conventions and purposes of each. Unfortunately, many individuals struggle with this distinction. For instance, there are cases where people mistake a reputable news channel for an unfamiliar YouTube channel or perceive personal social media posts from journalists as official news from their respective organisations. This confusion extends to content creators, the audience cannot tell non-professional producers from professionals. The emergence of television personalities and journalists as YouTubers has led to further confusion, with their content being taken for official programming from their former television networks.Awareness about the unique aspects of digital media, including issues related to online privacy, security, digital footprints and the spread of misinformation online, is also minimal in Nepal. Access to digital security training and tools for media outlets and content producers in Nepal is limited, leaving them vulnerable to cyber threats. Moreover, most people lack awareness about the ethical responsibilities of media producers and consumers, including privacy, consent, intellectual property and the impact of media consumption on individuals and society.Media literacy effortsDespite the government's lack of prioritisation of media literacy, a few government institutions and non-governmental organisations have taken steps to strengthen it. For instance, the Federation of Nepali Journalists (FNJ) has initiated media literacy programmes mostly tailored to journalists. The Press Council Nepal (PCN) conducts interactive programmes on digital literacy that align with its objectives. Certain municipalities have also organised media skills training programmes that incorporate media literacy. Moreover, political parties and local governments have launched initiatives to guide their members on effective media relations. Furthermore, secondary school curricula include topics such as media introduction, the importance of communication, media and entertainment, information technology, digital technology, and cyber-security. These efforts collectively contribute to bolstering media literacy across various sectors of society.It is necessary to enhance media literacy in Nepal by integrating media literacy initiatives into the legislative framework and the national plan of action, including the periodic plan. Education and training programmes on media literacy must go beyond the circle of journalists. Moreover, it is imperative to promote critical thinking skills among media consumers via targeted programmes in partnership with academic institutions, government entities and civil society organisations. \nFederalism in Nepal is alive and kicking. Eight-and-a-half years after the new constitution institutionalised a three-tier federal state, the provinces, the second tier, neither have police forces of their own nor can they employ their own civil servants. Whenever there is a change of government in Kathmandu, or even a change in coalition partners for that matter, the provincial governments too are invariably rocked. Oh, and when folks in other provinces face some problem, they have to troop all the way to Kathmandu for redress. Sugarcane farmers have repeatedly made the long march from various districts in the Tarai-Madhesh in order to demand a decent price for their produce. The same is the case with the 22-member Chure and Forest Conservation Campaign team that is currently marching from Bhardaha of Saptari district to Kathmandu. Their goal is to garner the national government’s attention on the destruction of the Chure region, a string of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west. Natural water sources originating at the foothills of Chure have been drying up in the past few years, and the first layer of underground water has been severely depleted in much of the Tarai. The campaigners started the long march on April 28 in to exert pressure on authorities concerned about the unchecked deforestation and haphazard extraction of sand and stones in the Chure region, resulting in an acute water crisis. The campaigners have a 12-point charter of demands, including strong action against forest officers who work hand in glove with smugglers, control of illegal extraction of river-bed materials from the rivers and streams in the Chure region, declaration of Madhesh as a dry zone, and concrete plans to control forest fires. Last year, the campaign had undertaken a similar march to Kathmandu demanding control of the pollution of the Sirsiya river that flows through Birgunj, a major business hub in Madhesh Province. The Sirsiya river has become highly polluted due to the toxic industrial waste generated by several factories on the Parsa-Bara industrial corridor. The campaigners had met many high-ranking government officers and ministers in Kathmandu. But nothing happened. The country’s most eco-sensitive region is being devastated by illegal deforestation and sand-mining and millions of people are having to scrounge for water. Yet the authorities, both at the federal and provincial levels, seem unbothered. One big reason the old unitary state was replaced by a federal setup was so that the fruits of development could trickle down to the lowest rungs of the society, and the voices of people at the grassroots could be heard and addressed without delay. Yet what we see is that the same criminal-political nexus that benefitted the most from the old structure continues to dominate the federal state as well. In many cases, the illegal miners and deforestors active in the Chure region would have funded the election campaigns of (current) federal and provincial lawmakers, getting in return the licence to do pretty much as they please. People at the grassroots meanwhile have to beg with the authorities just to drink some clean water. Apparently, the more things change in Nepal, which has long been under the sway of a corrupt elite, the more they stay the same.  \nAs the midsummer heat threatens to bring a wave of the loo in the plains of Tarai-Madhes, all eyes are on the sky, expecting a spell of cloudbursts and rain. But once the monsoon enters in less than a month, we will be back to running for shelter. This year, Nepal, like much of South Asia, could experience above-normal monsoon rains, the result of La Niña, a condition associated with normal to above-normal southwest monsoon rainfall over much of South Asia. Technical experts at the 28 sessions of the South Asian Climate Outlook Forum (SASCOF-28) held in the last week of April said the second half of the southwest monsoon season will likely develop La Niña. This will also mark the realisation of the fear of two extremes—of heat and rain—in South Asia this year.While we stand to make some windfall from the wet climate, especially in the agricultural sector, there is a huge cost attached to the onslaught of heavy monsoon rains—landslides and flooding. Each monsoon, we fear the worst disasters but make little preparation to deal with them. And if we do not prepare in advance, the bounty we expect from the monsoon will soon turn into bane. Last monsoon, Nepal witnessed 328 events of landslide, 166 events of heavy rain and 59 events of flooding, according to the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority (NDRRMA). Ninety-six persons were killed in landslides, 19 in floods and eight in heavy rains. This means that our existing mechanisms of defence against destruction will probably not work. We might face similar or even bigger catastrophes this year, too, if we do not prepare well.But as of now, news reports about advanced preparation for disasters are hardly positive. If the unitary state of the past was inefficient in dealing with disasters, the federal state of Nepal has its own complications. While authorities at the NDRRMA complain of a lack of human and financial resources to deal with large-scale disasters, the local levels, which are the closest and the most accessible forms of the state to the people, have similar woes. The familiar problem of a lack of coordination between the three tiers of government stands to dampen our disaster preparedness and response actions.Another set of disasters that comes as part of the monsoon each year is water-related epidemics. Each monsoon enters with the risk of dengue, malaria, and cholera. And it is in these crucial times that our health care system does not function optimally, with health centres in several parts of the country failing to provide basic medicines and care. We cannot make lethargy a habit and wait for disasters. From daivi prakop (divine disasters) to prakritik prakop (natural disasters), we have made some advances in our understanding of disasters. It is now time to consider disasters manaviya prakop—the result of human actions—and intervene on time for risk reduction and long-term resilience. \nThe three branches of the government function through a system of check and balance. When one of the executive, the legislative or the judicial branches exceeds its bounds, the others remind it of its constitutional limits. In the post-1990 democratic setup, the judiciary for one has by and large played a positive role in upholding democratic values that had repeatedly come under assault, particularly by the executives who refused to accept any limits on their powers. Yet of late some questionable verdicts of the top court in the country have raised the spectre of a ‘judicial supremacy’. On May 3, a division bench of the Supreme Court raised many eyebrows when it ruled that the Speaker of the Gandaki Provincial assembly should not be counted as an assembly member in the government formation process. So, in the 60-member assembly, even 30 members could constitute a majority. Back in March 2021, in a highly unanticipated decision, deciding what was essentially a petition challenging the party’s name, the court dissolved the ruling Nepal Communist Party. A couple of months later, the court even appointed Sher Bahadur Deuba the new prime minister. As there are disputes on government formation in nearly each of the seven provinces, the Supreme Court could time and again be asked to settle them, just like in Gandaki. That is not all. The decision on judging the legality of the recent split of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal also now rests with the top court. What we repeatedly see is that the court is being asked to rule on what are essentially political disputes. If there was even a minimum level of understanding among our major political actors, many of the disputes in the provinces could have been settled among themselves. In other words, it is our major political actors who are inviting judicial activism. This in turn undermines the credibility of the judiciary. Yet that is only one worry. If our political actors continue to turn to the courts to handle all major and minor political disputes, then we should not be surprised if the third branch of the state starts acting more and more arbitrarily. There is then also the risk of the courts being cooped by other power centres, as is the case, say, in our neighbouring Pakistan or Myanmar. In order to uphold its image as a neutral interpreter of the constitution and other laws, the judiciary could do its bit by declining to hear cases of certain nature that are best decided through political dialogue, or through healthy discussions in the sovereign parliament. Our political actors should also learn to act more maturely. Yes, the kind of electoral system the country has is unlikely to ensure a high level of political stability. Yet our politicians cannot get away by putting all the blame on the system. They too must learn to show at least a minimum level of political maturity. Again, the democratic system only works through check and balance. If one organ of the state forgets its duties, the whole system destabilises.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nThe third edition of the Nepal Investment Summit starts today. At the event, the Nepal government will present the prospects of investing in Nepal to investors and try to attract Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Nepal acknowledges that foreign direct investment plays a major role in its economic development, given the shortage of resources within the country. The Post’s Purushottam Poudel sat down with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Saturday to discuss the summit and what Nepal aims to gain from it.Nepal hosted two investment summits before this, in 2017 and 2019. Nepal hasn’t been able to draw the investments promised in both editions of the summit. What different is Nepal doing this time to attract more investment?We have learned from the two previous investment summits. We have also compared ourselves with our neighbouring countries in terms of attracting investments. Data suggests that while they have attracted around 30 percent of the commitments made in similar summits, Nepal has received more.We have drawn around 35 to 40 percent of the investment pledges, which should be considered good. However, we need more than this. This time, we have learned from our previous experience as to why more investment did not come.This time, we have invited investors or people who are researching possible investment prospects to the summit. We are presenting the success stories of people who have invested in other countries of the world or in Nepal. So that it can inspire people to invest.The government brought an ordinance to amend the laws that were seen as obstacles to foreign investment just a few days ago. The ordinance awaits the President’s approval. Potential investors must have noticed this. What do you say?The government has decided to amend some laws through the ordinance that we consider necessary from previous experience. The amended law has reached the President's Office for verification. By the time this interview goes to press, the ordinance may get certified. This will be strong evidence for national and international investors that Nepal is investment-friendly.On the other hand, there is the matter of sovereign credit rating—we have already started work on this. It has not started, but it will be finished soon. Once the rating works get completed it will confirm that we are more open to foreign investment. After this, we will be able to know Nepal’s investment rating without asking anyone.Based on this, foreigners can come to Nepal for investment. All these reasons show we are becoming more investor-friendly. On foreign investment, we are bringing a better policy than in the past. With policies on taxes and investment, we are creating an environment that will make it easier to bring in investments, and for investors to take the benefits back to their country without hassle.There are examples of complications faced by investors to take back dividends. Axiata, the parent company of Nepal's private telecom company Ncell, faced the problem. How will investors be attracted when they cannot take profit home?There is a legal provision for withdrawing the return on investment. We are trying to make it simple and practical by learning from the experience of other countries. No multinational company has suffered losses in Nepal. Everyone is earning profits. Ncell has raked in profit many times its investment in Nepal. Dabur Nepal and Unilever are also making profits. There are other multinational companies that are making profits by investing in Nepal.Similarly, foreign investments in the hospitality sector have also returned profits. These profits earned by the companies are no less than what they earn elsewhere. The problem seems to be that we are not presenting our data properly. We will also use this summit as a platform for investors to share their experiences of successfully investing in Nepal.Many investors appear to be attracted to hydropower. However, India has adopted a policy of not buying power from projects with Chinese investment. This also affects our investment climate. How will the government address this?We have made plans for 10 years and plans for 15 years. We have also studied how much energy we need in the coming years. Our emphasis is on clean energy such as hydropower and solar. Our policy is to sell surplus energy to neighbouring countries. Our main markets are India and Bangladesh. China is also our market, to an extent. We have signed various energy-related agreements with India, Bangladesh and China.Investments are coming into this sector from these countries. Business is also being done. Some infrastructure related to the cross-border transmission line is being built. A 400 KV high voltage transmission line has been built on the India side. Some others will be built soon. The Dhalkebar-Muzaffarpur transmission line has been built. Butwal-Sunauli is in progress. Similarly, Lamki-Bareli is also in the pipeline. A long-term agreement has been signed with India to sell 10,000 megawatts of hydropower in 10 years.The agreement signed during Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to India last year is in the implementation phase. An agreement has been reached to sell 40 megawatts of hydropower to Bangladesh through India. Bangladesh has asked us for more electricity. We are coordinating with Bangladesh and India at various levels on this issue.As far as the Indian policy is concerned, we will try to consume our own electricity first. We will try to sell the surplus energy to regional markets.Nepal’s political instability is said to be distracting foreign investors. How do you convince them?There is no truth in this. Change of political leadership does not hinder foreign investment in Nepal. This is a normal practice in a democratic system with regular elections. Sometimes the government veers into the minority. Our mixed electoral system tends to give no single party the majority. As a result, we have a coalition government. And whether or not the government maintains policy consistency is important. We may not always have a stable government, but we have a stable policy.We have adopted consistent policies in the fields of hydropower and cement industries for 10 to 15 years. The minister may be changed due to the change of government, but there is no change in policy. Any change in policy is meant for the convenience of investors.When the government was led by the Congress-Maoist alliance, it was said that big investors—from India's richest man, Gautam Adani to the Tata Group—were interested in investing in Nepal. However, with the communist forces in power, they are said to be reluctant.This is just a rumour spread by those who do not want the prosperity of Nepal. It is true that some people close to Indian businessman Gautam Adani came to Nepal, and they showed interest in investing in Nepal. According to my information, Adani has invested in Nepal's cement industry. And even now he is positive about investing in Nepal. His representatives are coming to the investment summit as well. The summit is not a matter related to the views of any party. This is Nepal's investment conference. Just because there is a particular coalition does not mean investment will not come. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was the leader of the government when the summit was announced and he is still leading the government. Such rumours are propaganda peddled by those who want to keep investments away.Again, as far as Gautam Adani is concerned, I am personally in touch with people who work with him at various levels. When I became a minister, I invited Adani to Nepal, and we have interacted with him frequently. He is still looking at different areas of investment. He is especially interested in airport construction and management and the energy sector.Geopolitical factors are also believed to impact investments. Is the government prepared to ensure that geopolitics does not affect investment prospects?There are geopolitical conflicts all over the world. In Nepal, we are not against anyone's legal investment. We have always welcomed foreign investment that comes with good intent. If geopolitics affects investment, the most intense geopolitical competition is between the US and China. But these two countries are also the world's largest trading partners. When talking about India and China, there may be competition between them, but there is also cooperation. We need legitimate investment in priority areas. We want to ensure that the investments coming into our country are not targeted against any country.Let’s invest in Nepal. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
