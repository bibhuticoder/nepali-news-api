Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nFive months after forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli, coalition partners Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are in the final stages of forming mechanisms to identify the areas for amending the constitution.A major agreement between the Congress and the UML while forming the government in mid-July was to amend the constitution and review provisions that have created difficulties in its implementation.On Tuesday, the constitution amendment process finally entered bilateral talks between the Congress and the UML. An eight-member task force formed to strengthen the relations between the two parties met on Tuesday and discussed initiating the amendment process. “The issue of amendment has finally entered our discussion from today [Tuesday],” a task force member said. “We are currently discussing how to proceed and start wider discussions and consultations. We are considering forming either a political or a non-political taskforce to do the required homework.”The cross-party task force will be led by a senior politician, and comprise members of different political parties. If a non-political task force is formed, it will be led by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court or any other respected legal figure acceptable to all stakeholders. Some Congress and UML leaders have suggested forming a non-political mechanism or taskforce where legal experts, constitutional experts, human rights activists among others can be accommodated and a way ahead can be found as per their suggestions, according to a taskforce member. “We will confront difficult questions if we form a political mechanism,” he said. The meeting lasted three hours and leaders also discussed some ‘neutral’ names who can potentially lead such a mechanism or taskforce. Some political parties in the opposition have already started discussion and deliberations on the issues that need to to be addressed in order to amend the constitution. Point number two of the seven-point agreement signed between the Congress and UML in July stated that the national consensus government under the leadership of Oli would give priority to making necessary amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses as well as the complexities seen in its implementation. “As per the understanding, our party will soon form a mechanism to identify the content for amendment,” said Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The Nepali Congress and the UML will soon form separate task forces to identify the contents for amendment in the constitution, Lekhak said at an event in Kathmandu. “The government has also taken an initiative on this.”“The amendment process does not end overnight. It will happen after a series of discussion and deliberations among the parties. We will assess our decade-long experience of constitutional practice and, accordingly, all political parties will sit together and make amendments,” he said.“We will initiate discussions, evaluate and assess the status of the implementation of the constitution, identify the amendment subject matters, and proceed with discussions and deliberations,” said Lekhak.The agreement between the two largest parties to amend the constitution has ignited debate in and outside political circles. Parties are divided on whether this is the right time to make changes in the constitution. But Home Minister Lekhak said the ruling and opposition parties will first review the 10-year journey of the constitution and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Second, the two ruling parties will identify the issues that need to be amended and the ruling and opposition parties will sit together for this. At last, the Congress and UML will reach an agreement on the content for amendment and table it in the house. He also clarified that the amendment to the constitution will strengthen inclusiveness rather than weaken it. The third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), will also soon publicise its position on constitution amendment. The upcoming central committee meeting of the party scheduled to kick off on January 5 will open discussions on the matter, said party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota. “The party has its own position on the amendment but we are open to discussions,” Sapkota said. The party will make its position public only after the meeting of its central committee.“Our position is clear: any amendment to the constitution should be for a progressive cause, not for a regressive cause. It should aim at development and prosperity. Second, there should be a directly elected president for political stability. We must opt for full inclusiveness in both houses of parliament. If we guarantee these issues in the new amendment proposal, the protracted political instability in the country will come to an end,” said Sapkota.Besides the Maoist Centre, other political parties represented in parliament are also doing homework regarding the amendment in the constitution but they are yet to make their position, preparation and homework public.Another party, the CPN (Unified Socialist), on December 17 formed a seven-member task force under party leader Prakash Jwala to work out the party’s position on the constitution amendment process. “We have formed a task force which will come out with some recommendations in this aspect,” said party spokesperson, Jagannath Khatiwada. Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, also said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and amendments would be made cautiously.“The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said. “Within a few days, the Congress and the UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.”He said the constitution cannot be amended just because the Congress and the UML want it. It will be done only after broad consultations among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political forces.“After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend minimum provisions necessary to ensure the constitution’s smooth functioning,” Thapa said. \nThree murders occurred in Kathmandu over the weekend: Milan Acharya murdered his father and brother, while Nayan Gurung was killed in a brawl at Town Cafe.\nThe National Human Rights Commision (NHRC) has said the selection of office bearers for the two transitional justice commissions on merit is not possible through the present set-up of the recommendation committee.Explaining the reasons for the failure of the recommendation to pick the office bearers, Manoj Duwadi, a member of the commission, said the recommendation committee dominated by the representatives of the political parties cannot make a right selection.“Only two in the five-member [recommendation] panel are neutral. Three others act as dictated by their parties,” he said at an interaction held by the commission on Tuesday.Duwadi was a member of the former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra-led recommendation committee that exhausted its two-month tenure on December 16 without completing its responsibility. It was tasked with recommending a chairperson and four members each for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.However, it recommended the government start a fresh selection process saying it could not reach consensus in selecting names and recommending names through majority would have lasting implications for the peace process. Other than Mishra and Duwadi, the five-member panel had Arjun Karki, a former ambassador; Khamma Bahadur Khati, former attorney general; and Stella Tamang, a human rights activist.As claimed by Duwadi, Karki represents the CPN-UML, Khati is a Nepali Congress affiliate and Tamang is close to the CPN (Maoist Centre). The Mishra-led panel, which had finalised the rest of the names, couldn’t agree on the name of TRC chairperson.The Congress, which has staked a claim to the position, had pushed for Sudip Pathak, a former NHRC member. It had presented former deputy attorney general Biswaraj Koirala and Sher Bahadur KC, a former president of the Nepal Bar Association. Their names were not endorsed by Mishra and Duwadi for their controversial past or for claims that they were incapable to command the position. “In my personal opinion, the NHRC, if given the responsibility, can select 10 competent office bearers but it is not possible through the present mechanism,” said Duwadi.The commission held the interaction to seek feedback from the stakeholders amid the uncertainty so as to devise the NHRC’s strategy, according to Surya Dhungel, who is the transitional justice focal point at the commission. The victims present in the interaction had conflicting views over the role of the selection committee and how the process should move ahead. Ram Kumar Bhandari, coordinator of the National Network of the Victims of Serious Violations of Human Rights, slammed the recommendation committee and Duwadi for failing to fulfil their responsibility. “You have betrayed us. It was your job to recommend the names. On what legal grounds did you recommend the government start a selection process afresh?” asked Bhandari.“Why did you stretch the selection process until the last day if you knew the committee could not deliver? You have to refund the allowances you took despite wasting crucial two months.”Bhandari even blamed the commission for politicising the selection process.However, other victims opposed Bhandari arguing that it was better not to recommend the name rather than endorsing names taken out of the pockets of political leaders.“We have already waited 18 years and can wait longer but won’t accept perpetrators at the commissions,” said Shankar Budhathoki, a conflict victim. “Why should we accept whatever names these three party leaders project? Better late than have spoilers in the commissions.”He thanked the Mishra-led committee for refusing to recommend the names dictated by the parties. The human rights activists also backed Budhathoki saying that the selection committee was successful in shattering the plan of the major parties to appoint the office bearers on political sharing.“It might take a few more months to select the office bearers but I appreciate how the selection committee dared to refuse to be a rubber stamp of the political parties,” said Charan Prasai, a human rights activist. “The NHRC representative had been betraying [by endorsing the names in the past]. This time he [Duwadi] took a right stand.”As the Mishra-led panel failed to fulfil its responsibility, there are two options left: form a new recommendation committee or give the Mishra-led committee more time to find the right persons. Though the top leaders of the major parties have discussed the matter informally, they are yet to reach an agreement. The United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office and other diplomatic missions too are interacting with the stakeholders on the matter to devise their position. \nFarmer Ratan Rawat of Chandannath Municipality, Jumla, diversified his farming from traditional paddy cultivation to cash crops like apples and vegetables.He initially used to cultivate paddy only. Rawat is now reducing the paddy cultivation area and increasing the area for apples and vegetables.“I used to transplant paddy on my 10 katthas of land. But for the last four years, I have been cultivating apples and vegetables,” he said. His paddy acreage has now been reduced to six katthas.Most of the farmers in the municipality, engaged in paddy farming, have now switched to cash crops.Khadak Budha, another farmer from the same village, has reduced the paddy field by half. He said he used to produce 30 sacks of paddy until a few years ago, but his output declined to 15 sacks.With the good income from apples and vegetables, Budha reduced the paddy acreage.“Apple is in demand,” said Rawat. Though he had no intention to cut on paddy cultivation, as apple farming started generating good income, he gradually switched to apple production.In the highlands of mid-western Nepal, commercial vegetable and apple farming thrived after paddy started to yield little income and there was a shortage of farmhands. The rise in disease also forced people to switch to cash crops from cereal production.“Vegetable farming generates better income than growing paddy. That’s why farmers shifted to vegetable farming,” said Rawat.Farmers have focused on the production of vegetable seeds as well.Compared to last year, paddy production has declined in Karnali this year. In the current fiscal year, 123,795 tonnes of paddy was produced on 39,763 hectares compared to 124,969 tonnes in the last fiscal year.In Karnali Province, paddy is mainly produced in Surkhet, Salyan, Dailekh and West Rukum. Jajarkot, Jumla, and Kalikot are also some areas where paddy is cultivated.The highest elevation at 3,050 metres is Chhumjul of Jumla, a record altitude where rice is cultivated in Nepal.According to the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Surkhet produced 52,904 tonnes of paddy, more than the sum of Dailekh’s 25,120 tonnes and Salyan’s 23,630 tonnes. According to the statistics for the past five years, paddy production in Karnali has been continuously declining. In the fiscal year 2019-20, paddy output in Karnali was 151,805 tonnes, which dropped to 137,165 tonnes in 2020-21. The output dropped to 125, 143 tonnes in 2021-22 and rose slightly to 128,000 tonnes in 2022-23. Out of 299,339 hectares of arable land in Karnali, farming is done on 216,880 hectares. Paddy covers 45,468 hectares.According to the statistics, paddy in Surkhet covers 12,679 hectares, followed by 8,313 hectares in Dailekh and 7,078 hectares in Salyan. Similarly, in West Rukum, paddy is cultivated on 3,048 hectares, followed by Kalikot with 3,081 hectares and Jajarkot with 3,063 hectares.Purna Bahadur Thapa, the ministry's information officer, said that output and field of paddy both have declined sharply. “The paddy production area has shrunk, mainly in Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Salyan.”Paddy production has dropped due to a lack of irrigation. The rainfall damages irrigation canals in the hilly district. “Lack of rainfall was also a problem. If the rainfall gets delayed, it creates difficulties sowing the seeds. As a result, paddy transplantation is not completed on time,” said Thapa. “The delay in paddy transplantation impacts production.”The provincial government data shows that out of the total irrigable land in Karnali, only 35.21 percent is covered by irrigation facilities. The round-the-year irrigation facility is provided only on 38,338 hectares, while 30,302 hectares are partially irrigated.Thapa said that the farmers also face the problem of insufficient seeds. As farmers have applied new hybrid seeds, new diseases have emerged. The increasing urban area also reduced production and farming land. \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nThroughout Nepal’s legal history, juvenile justice has remained a neglected issue. Only after Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on September 14, 1990, did the concept of justice for children begin. The commitment also led Nepal to introduce the Children’s Act, 2048 (1992). The Act served as the first-ever legislation related to children and their rights. While it was a landmark step for the security of children, it still fell short of our expectations.The act was weak and outdated with vague provisions and inadequate protections for children who fell into conflict with the law. So, the call for a more comprehensive legal framework grew louder. This demand cultivated an environment for formulating the Act Relating to Children 2018, which strengthened Nepal’s juvenile justice framework. However, despite the advancements, challenges remain as the law fails to bridge the gap between law and practice.Under the fourth subsection of Provision 43 in the 2018 Act, it is stipulated that “when a juvenile offender reaches the age of eighteen while still serving their sentence, they aren’t to be transferred to an adult prison, but rather to a special facility”. A special facility for those transitioning from juvenile centres to adult prisons was attempted, but it didn’t materialise, likely due to logistical challenges. As a result, juveniles as young as 12 years are housed alongside individuals nearing 30. This practice alone has been overcrowding juvenile facilities. When supported by a weakly enforced law, this system blatantly contradicts the CRC, which prohibits the housing of juvenile convicts with adult convicts.Earlier this year, in conversation with the director of the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programme (UCEP)—an organisation advocating for child rights—I discovered that all eight of Nepal’s juvenile detention centres have a combined capacity of just 390. But more than 1,300 delinquents are kept in these facilities, which creates severe overcrowding.The effects of overcrowded facilities extend beyond logistical challenges. They also leave a harmful mark on the psychological, intellectual and moral development of the juveniles. Undoubtedly, an individual’s growth is heavily influenced by their surroundings. The young mind is malleable, and when put in an environment far from conducive, the chances of them adopting harmful behaviours are sky-high. The recent incidents in Nepal’s juvenile centres highlight a serious dysfunction. For instance, this July, the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Banke saw a violent delinquent-led outburst, marking a third such incident of its kind in just 12 months. These clashes, which resulted in deaths and numerous injuries, accentuate the need to address the systemic flaws in our judicial system. However, when discussing the issue, it is equally crucial to note that the roots of these problems don’t just lie in our flawed legal system. They are deeply connected with the socioeconomic realities of incarcerated children.From my interview with the UCEP, I found that 95 percent of these young delinquents come from struggling, impoverished families. These are children who have never known a life beyond their huts and farming; children who aren’t familiar with financial peace; children who battle to survive each day; children who commit crimes, unaware that it makes them criminals. This is a situation born out of legal illiteracy. The level of legal literacy among the youth in urban centres like Kathmandu itself is weak and the concept is practically foreign in the villages. As a student, I believe that a good part of this shortcoming is a direct reflection of the weakness of our education system. While the government-issued school-level curriculum includes topics related to the constitution and the legal system, the content merely scratches the surface. The coursebooks enlist laws, yet they fail to inform about the consequences of breaking them. Our curriculum omits crucial details about the legal process, like the trial system, juvenile detention centres and what follows the commission of a crime. This superficial approach leaves students with minimal knowledge on our rights and responsibilities, making us vulnerable to unintentional infractions.However, it would be unfair to place the entire blame on the curriculum alone, as society, too, plays a big role in this issue. With limited public discourse on legal rights, provisions and consequences, our society is failing the youth. I’ve witnessed that society often consumes itself with discussions on matters unrelated to our immediate concerns. They fail to devote time and attention to educating the young about the legal system governing them. If we allocate even a fraction of our focus to legal education, especially for the youths, the next generation will be safe from falling into conflict with the law.Ultimately, this failure to provide comprehensive legal education, by both the curriculum and civil society, leaves us with only a shallow understanding of our rights and responsibilities as citizens. This lack of awareness makes us highly vulnerable within the justice system, where ignorance invites consequences. So I ask, why should children bear the title of convict if they are unaware that their normality is a federal offence? Why should they pay the price for the weakness of the government-issued curriculum? It’s about time we shifted our approach. We must establish a society where juveniles can find security in lawmakers and law enforcement officers. Educators must never forget that legal advancements are only effective with proper implementation.  \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nTalks on seafood trade are expected to be on the agenda on Wednesday when Japan’s foreign minister visits China, Japan’s largest export market for aquatic products until Beijing placed a blanket ban in protest against Tokyo releasing treated radioactive wastewater into the ocean.It would be Takeshi Iwaya’s first visit to the Chinese capital since he became Japan’s foreign minister in October and he is scheduled to hold talks with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and meet other Chinese officials.A major sticking point in bilateral trade has been Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant wastewater discharge. Beijing had strongly opposed and condemned Tokyo’s decision on that and tightened inspections on Japanese goods in response.China imposed a full ban in August last year after Japan began releasing the treated radioactive water but both governments reached an agreement in September that would set a path toward restarting seafood shipments from Japan to China.Nikkei reported this week that China was contemplating lifting the import ban on Japanese seafood.But China still wants reassurances from Tokyo that it would fulfil its commitment to setting up a long-term international monitoring arrangement and allowing stakeholders such as China to conduct independent sampling and monitoring of the treated water.With sufficient monitoring, China will “adjust relevant measures” and gradually restore imports that meet standards and regulations, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.The one-day visit follows an agreement between leaders of both countries that they will work towards a mutually beneficial strategic relationship, strengthening communication at various levels.Relations between the neighbouring countries are in a “critical period of improvement and development”, Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month when he met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru.Xi said both should “be partners, not threats”.Trade partners with close economic and investment ties but rivals in security and territorial claims, China-Japan ties are complicated with long-standing geopolitical disagreements and historical wartime sensitivities.The first Japanese foreign minister to visit since April last year, Iwaya may raise his country’s concerns about Chinese military activities around Japan as well as regional issues including North Korea.Japan expressed “grave concern” last month over North Korea’s security alliance with Russia in which North Korea stands to gain advanced military technology and combat experience.Ukrainian and allied assessments show Pyongyang has sent around 12,000 troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukraine warned this week that North Korea could send more personnel and equipment for Moscow’s army.On less testy topics, China could prod Japan for reciprocity in visa policies.China last month expanded its visa-free arrangements to include Japan until the end of 2025, restoring a policy that was suspended during the pandemic.The country, which has been adding countries to its visa-free list, also extended the stay period from 15 days to 30. Japanese citizens were able to enter China without a visa for up to 14 days before COVID-19.Japan has not decided on a reciprocal move but China has said it hopes Japan would work towards improving people exchanges between the two countries. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine. But once you start to see the familiar shades of red and white peeking through the decorations and hear the distinct tune of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey blasting through every department store you visit, with the smell of cocoa drifting through the air, you begin to grin from ear to ear, knowing that the holiday season is here. For me, this time of year is all about my friends and family, the warmth they provide through their presence, the never-ending chats, hand warmers, and not to forget my annual passionate love affair with electric heaters! (Trust me, we two are inseparable!). The sounds of carols and bells reinforce my passion for baking, but then again, it might just be the cold weather tempting me to make something special for my loved ones to reciprocate the warmth and affection they provide me. If you are feeling adventurous this holiday season, let me share recipes perfect for spreading love among your loved ones.

Madhesh, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are experiencing generally cloudy conditions, while other parts of the country have partial to clear skies. Fog and mist were observed in a few locations in the Tarai and the Kathmandu Valley this morning. Light snowfall is expected in some high hilly and Himalayan areas, with fog or mist likely in the Tarai and the Valley during the early hours.   \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nSouth Africa will field debutant Corbin Bosch in their first test against Pakistan, starting on Boxing Day, as captain Temba Bavuma revealed the line-up on Tuesday.Bosch features in an all-seamer bowling line-up and will be playing on his home ground at Centurion, winning a test cap just days after making his one day international debut on Sunday, hitting 40 not out and taking one wicket as South Africa lost to Pakistan at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.The 30-year-old Bosch joins Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada and Dane Paterson in the home attack, getting an opportunity because of a long injury list that sees Ottneil Baartman, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje and Lizaad Williams all out because of injury or lack of fitness.\"It's one thing making your debut, but then to make it where you've made a name for yourself in the provincial setup is another thing,\" Bavuma said of Bosch at a press conference on Tuesday.\"I think Corbin adds an extra element to our bowling attack, he comes with the extra pace. Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with. We back our seamers here in Centurion and nothing has changed,\" Bavuma said.South Africa are chasing a win that would guarantee them a place in next June’s World Test Championship, as they sit top of the standings after winning their last five tests.\"We accept and acknowledge the fact that expectation has risen. There will be pressure that comes with that, but to be honest with you, we’re coming into the series to win the series 2-0, but we understand for us to do that, there's certain things that we need to do as a team.\"Keep things simple, keep doing the small things right and allowing the result to take care of itself,\" he added.South Africa team: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (wicketkeeper), Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson. \nSouth Korea’s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived bid to impose martial law on December 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition's propensity to impeach government officials.Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol's failed bid to impose martial law.It said Han was acting against the will of the people, effectively aiding Yoon, whose powers have been suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on December 14.Once an impeachment bill is submitted then formally introduced at a plenary session, it must be voted on within 24 to 72 hours.If Han is impeached, the finance minister would be next in line to lead the government as acting president, according to South Korean law.The penguins were cute, and the staff appearing in a Santa costume made the show exciting and very cute.Prime Minister Han took over from the suspended Yoon, who faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him or restore his powers.“Acting president Han made it clear at today's cabinet meeting that he would not greenlight the special prosecution law,” the DP's Park said.“There is no way to interpret it other than that he is delaying time.”With its parliamentary majority, the DP passed bills this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon, and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations.An unnamed high-ranking official from Han's office called the DP’s move to impeach Han “highly regrettable”, the Newsis news agency said.“The international community is currently supporting the acting president system ... Impeachment could undermine that trust, and adversely affect the economy,” Newsis cited the official as saying.Han’s office could not immediately be reached for comment.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) has accused the DP of threatening to topple the government for not complying with their demands, at a time when South Korea’s key ally the United States has just restarted planned communications with the country under Han's stewardship.Yoon has yet to announce his legal team or appear publicly since a televised statement on December 14, the day parliament impeached him.Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that Yoon is unlikely to appear for questioning on Wednesday, Christmas Day, in answer to a summons by authorities investigating his move to impose martial law.Yoon is prioritising the Constitutional Court's trial, Seok said. \nIt’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60 percent of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.The UN also will end 2024 having raised about 46 percent of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.The consequences are being felt in places like Syria, where the World Food Program (WFP), the UN’s main food distributor, used to feed 6 million people. Eyeing its projections for aid donations earlier this year, the WFP cut the number it hoped to help there to about 1 million people, said Rania Dagash-Kamara, the organization’s assistant executive director for partnerships and resource mobilization.Dagash-Kamara visited the WFP's Syria staff in March. “Their line was, ‘We are at this point taking from the hungry to feed the starving,’” she said in an interview.UN officials see few reasons for optimism at a time of widespread conflict, political unrest and extreme weather, all factors that stoke famine. “We have been forced to scale back appeals to those in most dire need,” Tom Fletcher, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told Reuters.Financial pressures and shifting domestic politics are reshaping some wealthy nations’ decisions about where and how much to give. One of the UN’s largest donors – Germany – already shaved $500 million in funding from 2023 to 2024 as part of general belt tightening. The country’s cabinet has recommended another $1 billion reduction in humanitarian aid for 2025. A new parliament will decide next year’s spending plan after the federal election in February.Humanitarian organizations also are watching to see what US President-elect Donald Trump proposes after he begins his second term in January.Trump advisers have not said how he will approach humanitarian aid, but he sought to slash US funding in his first term. And he has hired advisers who say there is room for cuts in foreign aid.The US plays the leading role in preventing and combating starvation across the world. It provided $64.5 billion in humanitarian aid over the last five years. That was at least 38 percent of the total such contributions recorded by the UN.Sharing the Wealth The majority of humanitarian funding comes from just three wealthy donors: the US, Germany and the European Commission. They provided 58 percent of the $170 billion recorded by the UN in response to crises from 2020 to 2024.Three other powers – China, Russia and India – collectively contributed less than 1 percent of UN-tracked humanitarian funding over the same period, according to a Reuters review of UN contributions data.The inability to close the funding gap is one of the major reasons the global system for tackling hunger and preventing famine is under enormous strain. The lack of adequate funding – coupled with the logistical hurdles of assessing need and delivering food aid in conflict zones, where many of the worst hunger crises exist – is taxing efforts to get enough aid to the starving. Almost 282 million people in 59 countries and territories were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in 2023. Reuters is documenting the global hunger-relief crisis in a series of reports, including from hard-hit Sudan, Myanmar and Afghanistan.The failure of major nations to pull their weight in funding for global initiatives has been a persistent Trump complaint. Project 2025, a set of policy proposals drawn up by Trump backers for his second term, calls on humanitarian agencies to work harder to collect more funding from other donors and says this should be a condition for additional US aid.On the campaign trail, Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial Project 2025 blueprint. But after winning the election, he chose one of its key architects, Russell Vought, to run the US Office of Management and Budget, a powerful body that helps decide presidential priorities and how to pay for them. For secretary of state, the top US diplomat, he tapped Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who has a record of supporting foreign aid.Project 2025 makes particular note of conflict – the very factor driving most of today’s worst hunger crises.“Humanitarian aid is sustaining war economies, creating financial incentives for warring parties to continue fighting, discouraging governments from reforming, and propping up malign regimes,” the blueprint says. It calls for deep cuts in international disaster aid by ending programs in places controlled by “malign actors.”Billionaire Elon Musk has been tapped by Trump to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new body that will examine waste in government spending. Musk said this month on his social media platform, X, that DOGE would look at foreign aid.The aid cuts Trump sought in his first term didn’t pass Congress, which controls such spending. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally on many issues, will chair the Senate committee that oversees the budget. In 2019, he called “insane” and “short-sighted” a Trump proposal to cut the budget for foreign aid and diplomacy by 23 percent.Graham, Vought, Rubio and Musk did not respond to questions for this report.Olympics and SpaceshipsSo many people have been hungry in so many places for so long that humanitarian agencies say fatigue has set in among donors. Donors receive appeal after appeal for help, yet have limits on what they can give. This has led to growing frustration with major countries they view as not doing their share to help.Jan Egeland was UN humanitarian chief from 2003 to 2006 and now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, a nongovernmental relief group. Egeland said it is “crazy” that a tiny country like Norway is among the top funders of humanitarian aid. With a 2023 gross national income (GNI) less than 2 percent the size of America’s, Norway ranked seventh among governments who gave to the UN that year, according to a Reuters review of UN aid data. It provided more than $1 billion.Two of the five biggest economies – China and India – gave a tiny fraction as much.China ranked 32nd among governments in 2023, contributing $11.5 million in humanitarian aid. It has the world’s second-largest GNI.India ranked 35th that year, with $6.4 million in humanitarian aid. It has the fifth-largest GNI.Egeland noted that China and India each invested far more in the type of initiatives that draw world attention. Beijing spent billions hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and India spent $75 million in 2023 to land a spaceship on the moon.“How come there is not more interest in helping starving children in the rest of the world?” Egeland said. “These are not developing countries anymore. They are having Olympics ... They are having spaceships that many of the other donors never could dream of.”Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China has always supported the WFP. He noted that it feeds 1.4 billion people within its own borders. “This in itself is a major contribution to world food security,” he said.India’s ambassador to the UN and its Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to questions for this report.To analyze giving patterns, Reuters used data from the UN’s Financial Tracking Service, which records humanitarian aid. The service primarily catalogs money for UN initiatives and relies on voluntary reporting. It doesn’t list aid funneled elsewhere, including an additional $255 million that Saudi Arabia reported giving this year through its own aid organization, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre.Restrictions and DelaysWhen aid does come, it is sometimes late, and with strings attached, making it hard for humanitarian organizations to respond flexibly to crises.Aid tends to arrive “when the animals are dead, people are on the move, and children are malnourished,” said Julia Steets, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank based in Berlin.Steets has helped conduct several UN-sponsored evaluations of humanitarian responses. She led one after a drought-driven hunger crisis gripped Ethiopia from 2015 to 2018. The report concluded that while famine was avoided, funding came too late to prevent a huge spike in severe acute malnutrition in children. Research shows that malnutrition can have long-term effects on children, including stunted growth and reduced cognitive abilities.Further frustrating relief efforts are conditions that powerful donors place on aid. Donors dictate details to humanitarian agencies, down to where food will go. They sometimes limit funding to specific UN entities or nongovernmental organizations. They often require that some money be spent on branding, such as displaying donors’ logos on tents, toilets and backpacks.Aid workers say such earmarking has forced them to cut rations or aid altogether.The US has a long-standing practice of placing restrictions on nearly all of its contributions to the World Food Program, one of the largest providers of humanitarian food assistance. More than 99% of US donations to the WFP carried restrictions in each of the last 10 years, according to WFP data reviewed by Reuters.Asked about the aid conditions, a spokesperson for the US Agency for International Development, which oversees American humanitarian spending, said the agency acts “in accordance with the obligations and standards required by Congress.”Those standards aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid, the spokesperson said, and aid conditions are meant to maintain “an appropriate measure of oversight to ensure the responsible use of US taxpayer funds.”Some current and former officials with donor organizations defend their restrictions. They point to theft and corruption that have plagued the global food aid system.In Ethiopia, as Reuters has detailed, massive amounts of aid from the UN World Food Program were diverted , in part because of the organisation’s lax administrative controls. An internal WFP report on Sudan identified a range of problems in the organization’s response to an extreme hunger crisis there, Reuters reported earlier this month, including an inability to react adequately and what the report described as “anti-fraud challenges.”The UN has a “zero tolerance policy” toward “interferences” that disrupt aid and is working with donors to manage risks, said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Solving the UN’s broader fundraising challenges will require a change in its business model, said Martin Griffiths, who stepped down as UN humanitarian relief chief in June. “Obviously, what we need to do is to have a different source of funding.”In 2014, Antonio Guterres, now the UN’s secretary-general and then head of its refugee agency, suggested a major change that would charge UN member states fees to fund humanitarian initiatives. The UN’s budget and peacekeeping missions already are funded by a fee system. Such funding would offer humanitarian agencies more flexibility in responding to need.The UN explored Guterres’ idea in 2015. But donor countries preferred the current system, which lets them decide case by case where to send contributions, according to a UN report on the proposal.Laerke said the UN is working to diversify its donor base.“We can’t just rely on the same club of donors, generous as they are and appreciative as we are of them,” Laerke said. \nNepali all-rounder Kushal Malla is set to play in the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after being signed by the Desert Vipers. The franchise brought Malla on board to replace injured Dutch all-rounder Bas de Leede.Desert Vipers’ Director of Cricket, Tom Moody, expressed confidence in Malla’s abilities, stating, “He is a young player but has already gained significant experience at the highest level.”Malla is currently Nepal’s fifth-highest run-scorer in T20 internationals, amassing 917 runs in 47 matches, including one century and four half-centuries. Notably, he scored an unbeaten 137 runs off 50 balls against Mongolia in the Asian Games, reaching his century in just 34 deliveries. Additionally, he has taken 43 wickets in both ODI and T20 international formats combined and has 768 runs in 39 ODIs.The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural ILT20 season, are set to face the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the opening match of the 2025 edition. The team boasts an impressive roster, including Alex Hales, Colin Munro, Rohan Mustafa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, Sheldon Cottrell, Tom Curran, Sam Billings, Luke Wood, Dinesh Chandimal, and Ruben Trumpelmann.The Desert Vipers is a professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team competing in the Emirati International League T20. \nMilan Acharya, who had been absconding following the Balkot incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning.According to police sources, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad Acharya and his 22-year-old son Prabin Acharya were discovered on Monday in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Balkot.“We found the father and younger son dead after breaking into the house on Monday morning. Their bodies were in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for Bhaktapur District Police Range. The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene. The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years. The Acharya family hails from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad Acharya, was acting head of the Khotang District Post Office. Elder son Milan had been preparing for public service exams, while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree. \nThe Nepal government has renewed its travel advisory for citizens planning to visit Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, highlighting increasing risks of human trafficking and fraudulent recruitment schemes.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), in an advisory issued on Monday, warned citizens to exercise caution and avoid falling victim to false promises of lucrative overseas employment. This advisory follows recent incidents involving Nepalis trafficked to Southeast Asian countries, particularly Myanmar’s Kayin province, where they were forced into illegal activities under harsh conditions.In the meantime, in a press release issued on Tuesday, the Embassy of Nepal in Bangkok reported the rescue of five Nepali citizens from Myanmar’s Mawadi. Four men were repatriated on December 17 with assistance from government and international organisations, while the fifth individual, a woman, returned to Nepal on December 24 [Tuesday].Earlier, in an advisory issued on Monday, the government detailed cases of the severe mistreatment victims endure, including confiscation of passports, excessive working hours, unpaid wages, and even physical abuse. It noted that criminal networks have expanded operations to Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, targeting Nepalis with fraudulent job offers.The ministry also underscored the use of social media platforms by traffickers to promote fake employment opportunities. Citizens have been advised not to travel on visit visas for work purposes and to verify job offers through embassies or official channels. \n\nThe issue of banning helicopter sightseeing tours in one of the world’s most iconic natural regions, home to the planet’s tallest mountain, from January 1, has turned nasty.As state bodies at all levels, including the local government, are staking their unflinching claim to the skies over the Everest region, serious questions have been raised about Nepal’s high-end tourism prospects. Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world. \nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art. His piece ‘Plantation’ reflects his experience living in the Tarai region, contrasting past greenery with current deforestation. Through this, Shah urges for reforestation and better land utilisation. Another of his prints portrays the dedication and hard work of labourers, despite their insufficient wages, using tribal imagery to emphasise their resilience and struggle.Each artist brings a unique perspective, blending personal stories, cultural heritage, and social commentary._____The Mini Prints Art FairWhen: Until January 15Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal RevisitedTime: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday: 12 noon to 5 pmEntry: Free \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba returned from New Delhi on Monday evening, with no clarity on when Prime Minister KP Oli will make his long anticipated official visit to India. Despite Oli’s eagerness to visit the southern neighbour since taking office in mid-July, efforts to secure an invitation from New Delhi have yet to succeed. At the same time, CPN-UML deputy general secretary and former foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali also returned home from New Delhi on Monday. According to officials, both the incumbent and former foreign ministers failed to make any headway in securing a date for Prime Minister Oli’s India visit.“This time, I went to India to participate in an Indo-Nepal economic summit and for a health check-up,” she said while responding to a question at Kathmandu airport upon her arrival. “I had no political meetings or discussions this time.” Deuba, who left for the Hague, Netherlands on December 7, leading Nepal’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), returned home via India where she also underwent a health checkup, according to a statement issued by her private secretariat. On December 9, she had presented Nepal’s position on the ‘Obligations of states in respect of climate change’ during ICJ hearings held from December 2 to 12.The hearings were initiated following the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, which requested the ICJ’s advisory opinion on states’ responsibilities concerning climate change.She then travelled to Berlin, Germany, to attend the Equal Rights Coalition Conference, scheduled on December 17 and 18. The conference was hosted by German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock on behalf of the Coalition’s co-chairs, Germany and Mexico. During her Europe visit, Minister Deuba held several high-level discussions with officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and the European Union.On Monday, before leaving for Kathmandu, she participated in an interaction at India Foundation which is led by Ram Madhav, former general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Deuba’s Delhi trip came with high expectations, especially after her last visit in August, when she met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as her counterpart, S. Jaishankar. But this time, the visit was unofficial and she thus could not meet Indian leaders, one official at the foreign ministry said. As she was in Delhi for her regular check up, no formal meetings were planned, according to Deuba’s private secretariat. But according to some Nepali Congress leaders, she tried her best to meet her counterpart, Jaishankar, and other Indian leaders in order to create a positive environment for the prime minister’s India visit, but her attempts were unsuccessful. The prime minister’s office also expected foreign minister Deuba, with her profile and good connections in the Indian establishment, to be able to meet top Indian leaders and lay the ground for the prime minister’s India visit. After the prime minister failed to secure an invitation from India, Oli went on his first bilateral visit to China in December first week and signed a framework for cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. According to a Nepali Congress leader closely following the dynamics between Oli and New Delhi, India appears uncomfortable with the deal Oli signed in Beijing, adding uncertainty to his Delhi trip. Also, there is unease in the Congress after the party leadership failed to maintain the party position of not taking loans under the BRI framework.While in Delhi, Rana had addressed an Indo-Nepal economic conference, met some policymakers and discussed the future of Nepal-India relations. Despite getting no invitation from India, Oli, speaking in his hometown in the district of Jhapa, had declared that he would visit India soon. “We have achieved good results from my China visit. Some people don’t believe I am going to India. But I am, and unexpected results will be achieved,” Oli had said. \nRabi Lamichhane, president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) that emerged as the fourth largest political force after the November 2022 election, has been officially suspended from the position of lawmaker on Monday. The Federal Parliament Secretariat issued a notice on Monday informing that Lamichhane has been suspended.After the District Government Attorney Office in Kaski on Sunday filed cases against lawmaker Lamichhane and 30 other individuals at the Kaski District Court in connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case, the House suspended his position of lawmaker the next day.Cooperatives fraud, organised crime and money laundering cases have been filed at the district court against Lamichhane, seeking 15 years of imprisonment and recovery of Rs278.9 million.Earlier, the Supreme Court had annulled Lamichhane’s position of lawmaker in January 2023 citing the invalidity of the citizenship certificate he produced to contest the parliamentary election. But later in the same year, Lamichhane won the by-election from Chitwan-2 to reclaim his lawmaker position. He had earlier won election from the same constituency.Before the Parliament Secretariat decided to suspend Lamichhane from his position on Monday, the RSP lawmakers had met Speaker Devraj Ghimire to urge him not to suspend their party president from the position of lawmaker. RSP chief whip Santosh Pariyar, and leaders Sobita Gautam and Ganesh Parajuli met Ghimire in order to draw his attention. After a case was registered against Lamichhane in the Kaski District Court for money laundering, cooperatives fraud and organised crime, the District Police Office Kaski had written to the Secretariat of House of Representatives to suspend the lawmaker position of Lamichhane. However, RSP leaders have been claiming that the lawmaker position cannot be suspended just on the basis of a filed case. “Lawmakers from the RSP had come to meet Speaker Ghimire to urge him not to suspend Lamichhane,” said Ekram Giri, the spokesperson of Parliament Secretariat. “The Speaker told them that he would take the decision as per the law.”According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2008 (amended), Lamichhane’s lawmaker post would have been automatically suspended. The suspension of Lamichhane as lawmaker has also raised questions about his party’s leadership as he is also the leader of the party's parliamentary party. The law states that if an official or employee of an established organisation or a public servant is in detention, their position will automatically be suspended. However, some legal experts believe that Lamichhane should not have been suspended as ‘public servants’ do not include elected representatives.Advocate Om Prakash Aryal disagrees. “The Prevention of Corruption Act defines a public servant as a person holding a public office under the prevailing law, which also includes elected representatives,” Aryal said. “In addition, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act also addresses this issue apart from Money Laundering Prevention Act, which justifies labelling elected representatives public servants.” Meanwhile, on Monday, the RSP appointed an acting president for the party’s smooth functioning in the absence of its chair. Based on Article 25 (4) (a) (9) of the party’s statute, Lamichhane on Sunday appointed Dol Prasad (DP) Aryal, the party’s founding vice-president, as the acting president. The decision was taken at a virtual emergency meeting of the party's secretariat on Monday.“Our party has decided to appoint DP Aryal as the acting president of the party,” reads the press statement issued by the party on Monday. “The party also has decided to support the judicial process in the party president’s case.”The RSP has two vice presidents: Aryal and Swarnim Wagle. Section 7 of Article 23 (1) of the RSP statute describes the party vice president’s functions, duties, and powers. According to the statute, in the absence of the party president, the vice president designated by the president or the elder among the two vice presidents will assume the role of the president. As per their citizenship details, Wagle is a few months older than Aryal. Wagle was born on May 29, 1974, while Aryal, the other party vice president, was born on August 22, 1974.The police had arrested Lamichhane from the RSP office on October 18 on charges of misappropriating cooperative savings from at least five different places across the country. Despite the party president being in custody for two months, the RSP had not designated any leader as acting president. However, the party's central committee meeting in November assigned roles related to the RSP’s future strategy to the two vice presidents.Some RSP leaders say the party leadership and the leadership in Parliament must be divided between two vice presidents. “If one vice-chair takes the party’s leadership, the other vice-chair can be the party leader in Parliament,” said an RSP leader, who is also a secretariat member. Earlier, after the Supreme Court annulled Lamichhane’s status as a lawmaker in January 2023, citing the invalidity of the citizenship certificate he produced to contest the parliamentary election, he did not give up the position of party chief. When Aryal was given the role of acting party president, Birajbhakta Shrestha, the deputy leader of the party in Parliament, played the role of party leader until Lamichhane was reelected from the Chitwan-2 by-election. On November 10, during a demonstration in Pokhara, now acting chair of RSP Aryal had said that Lamichhane would remain the President of the RSP for life. Referring to the tussle over the acting presidency in the RSP, he had said, “So long as Rabi Lamichhane is alive, he is the president of the RSP.” He also said who became acting president in Lamichhane’s absence was of secondary concern.  \nThe government has withdrawn a controversial provision from the ‘Bill to amend some Nepal Acts’ that envisioned allowing the withdrawal of criminal cases committed under political cover.The Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on May 10 last year had registered the bill at the Parliament Secretariat to amend Section 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code-2017 so as to clear the hurdles to withdrawing insurgency-era cases of “political nature”.Section 64 of the amendment bill has a provision that says cases sub judice in any court against anyone from a party or a group that conducted violent protests in the past but is carrying out its activities peacefully now, based on the constitution and the law can be withdrawn.In the bill, the government has added a sub-section under section 116 of the code, which ultimately aims at withdrawing the cases from all tiers of courts—Supreme, High and District—against political leaders. Participating in the discussion over the bill in the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, Law Minister Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya said that Section 64 of the bill had been drawn.“It has to be withdrawn as it might lead to impunity,” said the minister, adding that the decision was made with consent from Dhanraj Gurung, who in the capacity of law minister had registered the bill.Prior to Chaurasiya, Uday Raj Sapkota, secretary at the ministry, had revealed that the government had decided to withdraw the provision.The government holds the authority to produce the bill. It can also withdraw any bill or a part with consent from Parliament. Though a majority of lawmakers welcomed the government’s move, those from the CPN (Maoist Centre) objected to it. Claiming that the provision was introduced to implement past agreements with political forces such as those led by CK Raut and Netra Bikram Chand. Maoist lawmakers have threatened to register notes of dissent if the provision is withdrawn. “The government, in the past, signed deals with different political forces agreeing to withdraw the charges against them. It is the government's responsibility to abide by the agreements,” said Ram Kumar Rai, a Maoist Centre lawmaker.“In fact, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli, who also leads the government now, had forged the agreement. Instead of implementing it, the government is withdrawing the provision.”The preparations by the Dahal government to amend the Criminal Procedure Code had landed into controversy for suspicions that it was aimed at withdrawing the insurgency-era cases of atrocities.Even the National Human Rights Commission, organising a press meet, had objected to the move saying it was deeply concerned about the amendment bill. It argued there was a high possibility that the amendment would lead to the withdrawal of conflict-era charges of human rights violations by giving them political colour.The commission also sought the government’s clarification on the matter though the Dahal administration didn’t respond to it. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has received 63,718 complaints. Separately, 3,223 cases were lodged with the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, the disappearance commission is investigating only 2,484 cases saying that others do not fall under its jurisdiction.There are also several cases under consideration in various courts against Maoist Centre leaders and security personnel in connection with the crimes committed during the decade-long insurgency. If the bill got through Parliament, it would give a legitimate way for the government to arbitrarily withdraw the cases.After months-long gap, the House committee has resumed deliberation over the bill that has been under consideration for one-and-a-half years. As the government prepares to call the winter session of federal parliament in January, the Speaker, along with the government, wants the House committees to forward the bills, with them, to the plenary.Sixteen bills are under consideration in various parliamentary committees, also called mini parliaments. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nLinking the excitement of cricket via Nepal Premiere League (NPL) to the classrooms, Ncell Foundation, as per its commitment, will be providing educational kits to 2,612 students from community schools across Nepal. This impactful initiative of the Ncell Foundation to support the students at community schools is tied to the 653 boundaries hit during the entire season of NPL that concluded on Saturday. “This is a testament to the Foundation's commitment to transforming the excitement of cricket into meaningful educational support for underserved communities wherein the Foundation has committed to allocating four educational kits for every 4s hit during the NPL,” Ncell said in a statement. Each kit to be provided to students will include essential items such as school bags, notebooks, pencils, sharpeners, erasers, and more. “This season’s NPL has been a milestone in nurturing Nepali cricketing talents. We are thrilled to collaborate with NPL, combining the passion for cricket with a cause that provides essential educational resources to needy students. We are committed to working with CAN, all regional teams and other stakeholders to ensure the successful attainment of 2,612 educational kits distribution,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR at Ncell. \nNupu Sherpa of Tokpegola, situated around 4,100 meters above sea level in Mikwakhola Rural Municipality in Taplejung, sold 20 yaks in Tibet, China, back in 2019. He earned Rs110,000 per head, as there were no border restrictions on taking yaks to the Chinese market. Sherpa and five other herders in Thudam, Sankhuwasabha, a higher pass known as a centre for yak herding, used to sell yaks by crossing the Chinese border. During the pre-Covid period in 2019, the last time they traded yaks to Tibet, they brought Rs5 million each.But since then, they have not been able to export yaks to Tibet.“While trading in Tibet at that time, the 1 Chinese yuan was equivalent to Rs16,” said Sherpa. “I have heard that the rate has increased, but sadly, we cannot sell yaks anymore.”Sherpa currently owns 75 yaks, and all are mature enough to be sold. Normally, yaks have a life expectancy of 15-20 years, and after that, they turn thin and old. So, the commercial value of yak is at the age of 12.“The old yak does not fetch a good price, so selling them while they are still valuable is important,” said Sherpa. Now, to make ends meet, Sherpa has been making dog chews from yak milk. In the upper reaches, when the market in Tibet was open and vibrant, yaks were used as pack animals. “But now, rearing yaks has become a burden for many people,” said Sherpa.Nearly 180 households like Sherpa’s have the same problem—no market access.According to the Yak Farmers Federation, Taplejung, each family is rearing between five to 400 yaks.Sherpa, also president of the federation, said that their only alternative is to let yaks die. Yak farmers have requested Netra Prasad Sharma, chief district officer, to raise the issue with the officials on the other side of the border. Accordingly, on December 14, a meeting was held between the key officials of Taplejung and Dinggye County in southwest Tibet. “We have raised the issue, including to allow trade of agricultural products. It was the main agenda from our side at the meeting, but Tibet showed reluctance to resolve the issue faced by Nepalis living at the Nepal-China border point,” said Sharma.During the meeting, the Chinese representative said that Beijing would make the decision regarding livestock trade and that they would make requests to the higher authority.“We are hopeful the issue will be addressed,” said Sharma.The border people tried to export yak, milk, dog chew and ghee on different occasions but were returned, said Sharma.Kimathanka in Sankhuwasabha and 13 other trans-Himalayan trade points along the Nepal-China border were reopened in May after four years of closure.In May, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha reached Tibet through the Kimathanka border point, and Vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Silang Nima jointly opened the traditional trading points amid a function in the Tibetan town of Chentang. They announced the reopening of 14 of the 21 trading points in various districts along Nepal’s mountain range.Chinese authorities closed the border passes in January 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which severely disrupted the livelihoods of Nepalis living in remote mountain villages close to Tibet.“We have raised the issue at Nepal’s home ministry,” said Sharma.The locals who lost one of the crucial markets after Covid-19 were hopeful that the reopening of the border in May for people and trade movements would revive the yak trade.The residents in far-flung northern borders believe that the trade restrictions have also affected Tibet. Mingma Diki of Olangchung Gola said her family would buy yak calves from Tibet, rear them in Nepsl and sell them back to Tibet after they matured.“It’s strange that free trade with Tibet has stopped altogether.”Locals suspected that China might have stopped the yak trade due to lumpy skin disease that spread in Nepal in 2023. The first outbreak of lumpy skin disease in Nepal started in June 2020. By 2023, more than 48,000 cattle have died from the disease that has affected all of the country's 77 districts.More than 3,000 livestock were affected by lumpy skin in Taplejung, according to the Livestock Service Office.Tibet, however, has not officially made any statement about stopping yaks from coming from Nepal.“We submitted a special proposal on this issue, but Beijing declined it,” said Chheten Sherpa Lama, ward chairman of Phaktalung rural municipality, who was in the Nepali delegation with chief district officer Sharma, to Tibet as a translator.The population of yak has been increasing and causing additional burden to farmers, said Lama.“Feeding yaks is becoming increasingly difficult, and fodder shortages are adding to our hardship.”As per the District Livestock Office statistics, there are around 8,000 yaks in Taplejung. The federation said that even if a yak is priced at Rs50,000, Taplejung has yaks worth Rs400 million. Around 60 percent of yaks are at the age to be sold.Locals of the mountain region have been rearing yaks at 3,000 to 5,000 metres as their traditional occupation. They are reared particularly in the higher passes of Sirijunga, Phaktalung, Mikwakhola, Meringden and Phungling.According to the locals, yaks have also become prey to snow leopards, bears and wolves. \nThe Cabinet has given a green signal for the tourism ministry to register the long-pending civil aviation bills in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.Two bills—Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—propose splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities—service provider and regulator—a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.The bills passed by the cabinet on Friday were posted on the website of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Monday.The then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had put the bills into hibernation.On September 6, after being halted by the Dahal administration for over a year, the draft civil aviation bills made into the KP Sharma Oli Cabinet’s agenda. Since 2007, successive governments have proposed plans to end the regulator’s dual role. However, the bills have been languishing in obscurity, although they are vital to ensuring safe aviation in Nepal.Passing the civil aviation bills would establish an independent regulator and remove Nepal from the European Commission’s air safety list, which has caused immense damage to Nepal’s tourism and put a spotlight on the country’s terrible aviation safety record. In December 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepali airlines from flying into the 28-nation bloc.Tourism Minister Badri Prasad Pandey tabled the bills at the Cabinet on September 6 after the law and finance ministries approved their drafts.When a bill is presented, the Cabinet approves the draft legislation and its introduction to Parliament.Nepal has a terrible aviation safety record—eight crashes—six fatal ones—taking place over the past two and a half years, killing over 100 people.Lawmakers have raised concerns about the government’s delay in implementing the new law, which aims to establish an independent civil aviation regulator.Tourism ministry officials say this is the fourth time they have sent the bills to the Cabinet since they were passed by the upper house in 2021. But every time, the government changes, and the bills return.On July 16, 2023, two months before the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the European authority for aviation safety, planned a safety audit of Nepal’s aviation system, the tourism ministry sent the draft bills to the Cabinet, seeking its ‘approval in principle’ to table them in Parliament.On August 2, 2021, the upper house unanimously passed the two aviation bills, which had been languishing for a year and a half as political squabbling engulfed the country. They were registered on February 23, 2020.In 2022, in its final audit report, the United Nations aviation watchdog ICAO formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body into two entities.Several aviation watchdogs, experts, and diplomatic agencies have urged Nepal to strengthen its independent regulatory body to ensure safer skies.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan (2007-08 to 2009-10), which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report is being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the plan has yet to be implemented. \nThe scan and pay system for Nepali travellers in India planned for this December will likely be delayed due to a commission issue, according to an operator privy to this matter.“In India, no charges are levied when paying through the quick response (QR) code. But when Nepalis start paying via QR code in India, a certain commission should be paid to Nepali banks for this service,” one payment operator said, wishing not to be named.“Now, who will pay the commission as merchants provide the service without charges?”There is no regulation regarding commissions or charges to be paid to Nepali banks on every transaction.In Nepal, when Indian travellers pay through the QR code, minimal standard charges of 1.95 percent are applied to merchants per transaction upon receiving payment via UPI-enabled payment apps. Consumers or merchants are not charged for payments from UPI-linked bank accounts. The UPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.In India, when a wallet user makes a payment, the merchant acquirer pays the interchange fee to the wallet issuer. Whether the acquirer will pass this fee to the merchant has not been determined. The interchange fee of up to 1.1 percent applies only on transactions above IRs2,000 to online merchants and large retailers. Furthermore, interchange fees do not apply to peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and small businesses in the P2PM category.India has mandated a zero-charge framework for UPI transactions from January 1, 2020. This means that UPI charges are nil for users and merchants alike.This issue in Nepal has delayed the activation of QR codes for Nepali travellers in India. This is a major hurdle to Nepalis making QR code payments in India, the source added.Operators say multiple discussions have been held regarding the commission issue, including the amount or percentage of the commission to be provided to Nepali banks and who will bear the cost. But there has been no logical conclusion so far.“India’s central bank is also discussing the issue with banks there,” according to the operator.“So it will still take a few months for Nepalis to make QR code payments in India.” Nepal is technically ready to start QR payments in India with approval from Nepal’s central bank. However, unless the Indian side gives a go-ahead, Nepal cannot start the QR payment in India.Nepal even has already conducted a successful trial transaction in India.In September, Nabil Bank trialled transactions through its mobile banking app in Mumbai, India, and achieved a successful result.The Reserve Bank of India needs to provide approval for payment system operators, and banks also need to show their readiness to start the service, operators said.On June 1 last year, Nepal and India signed a memorandum of understanding for cross-border digital payment to ease digital transactions for business people, students, and tourists from both countries.Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) International Payments Limited signed and exchanged the memorandum of agreement on behalf of their respective organisations in New Delhi, India.The digital remittance under cross-border digital payment service initiated through a government-to-government agreement has also been delayed from the Indian side.NCHL agreed to a cross-border digital remittance service. However, a year after the agreement, the service has yet to start.NCHL has a 10 percent investment from Nepal Rastra Bank and 90 percent from other commercial banks.The central bank handed NCHL the work of establishing and operating a national payment switch and card.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes. The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.Fonepay said that initially it received transactions of Rs2–3 million daily. Now it reaches around Rs7–8 million daily on weekends or during the tourist season and around Rs5 million daily on normal days.Indians making QR code payments in Nepal are gradually growing as many Indians still do not know about the service availability in Nepal, said Fonepay.Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nNepal received 460,940 doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on Tuesday evening, which will be used in the nationwide vaccination drive, scheduled to start on February 5, next year.The vaccine doses are part of over 1.7 million doses required for the first phase of the campaign, health officials say.“We received the first tranche of HPV vaccine doses,” said Om Prasad Upadhyay, an immunisation supervisor officer at the Department of Health Services. “Remaining doses will arrive before the start of the vaccination campaign.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women as well. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, the country purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years in all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.The Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide HPV vaccination drive from February 5 next year.During the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the HPV vaccine. Two doses of vaccine will be administered within a 12-month period. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has committed to supply the vaccine doses required for the campaign free of cost along with the campaign’s operation cost, officials say. The government has decided to include the HPV vaccine in the routine immunisation list following the compilation of the nationwide drive.It is estimated that there are around 350,000 girls aged 10 years who will be inoculated with the HPV vaccine.Nepal has to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nOne morning on a fading Tuesday of our vacation, I couldn't shake off the worry that my hard-earned savings from tutoring were slipping away faster than I’d planned. Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nJournalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, covering 1,000 kilometers and exploring major religious, cultural, and natural sites, showcasing the country's tourism recovery from economic challenges and the potential for increased tourism between Sri Lanka and Nepal.\nFour popular Nepali destinations highlighted, offering cultural immersion (Mundhum Trek), architectural marvel (Janaki Mandir), scenic beauty with snow (Kuri Village), and wildlife encounters (Bardiya and Khaptad National Parks).\nIn a thrilling U-19 friendly, Nepal drew 1-1 with Bhutan after Sushila KC's opener was canceled by Phuntsho Choden, despite Simran Rai's heroic goal-line clearance in the first half.\nCrucial events unfold as characters navigate challenges, overcome obstacles, and experience transformative moments.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz admitted on Monday for the first time publicly to Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July, further risking tensions between Tehran and its arch-enemy Israel in a region shaken by Israel's war in Gaza and the conflict in Lebanon.“These days, when the Houthi terrorist organisation is firing missiles at Israel, I want to convey a clear message to them at the beginning of my remarks: We have defeated Hamas, we have defeated Hezbollah, we have blinded Iran’s defence systems and damaged the production systems, we have toppled the Assad regime in Syria, we have dealt a severe blow to the axis of evil, and we will also deal a severe blow to the Houthi terrorist organisation in Yemen, which remains the last to stand,” Katz said.Israel will “damage their strategic infrastructure, and we will behead their leaders – just as we did to Haniyeh, Sinwar and Nasrallah in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon – we will do it in Hodeidah and Sana’a,” Katz said during an evening honouring defence ministry personnel.The Iran-backed group in Yemen has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year to try to enforce a naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel’s year-long war in Gaza.In late July, the political leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas was killed in Tehran in an assassination blamed on Israel by Iranian authorities. There was no direct claim of responsibility by Israel for the killing of Haniyeh at the time.Haniyeh, normally based in Qatar, had been the face of Hamas’ international diplomacy as the war set off by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 has raged in Gaza. He had been taking part in internationally brokered indirect talks on reaching a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.Months after, Israeli forces in Gaza killed Yahya Sinwar, Haniyeh's successor and the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nTrump's transition team plans to withdraw the US from the WHO on his second term's first day, continuing his criticism of the agency and isolating the US from international pandemic efforts.\nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nA few days ago, I attended a programme related to the Institute of Federalism at Madhesh University. During the event held in Rautahat, some participants questioned me about my stance on universities. They noted that when I was a member of Parliament, I opposed the proliferation of universities in Nepal, yet now I support Madhesh University. Their concern was valid, and I welcomed the opportunity to clarify my position.When I served in the National Assembly, I was the only member who voted against establishing new federal universities. My argument has been based on the constitutional framework. The Constitution of Nepal grants provinces the authority to set up and manage provincial universities. With over a dozen universities already under federal jurisdiction, adding federal universities appears unnecessary. Instead, provinces should lead the creation of universities tailored to their specific needs and provide sufficient justification.However, I have consistently emphasised that the federal government’s role should focus on forming a comprehensive higher education policy and an umbrella act for universities. This would create a clear framework for both federal and provincial governments to work together in expanding higher education. Without such a policy and legislative framework, the uncoordinated establishment of universities could strain resources, duplicate efforts and compromise quality. The federal government allocates funds to universities through the University Grants Commission (UGC), and at the provincial level, funding comes via fiscal transfers. However, if the trend of opening new universities continues, having both federal and provincial institutions compete for UGC grants and redirecting funds away from provinces and local governments to the UGC will undermine the purpose of establishing new universities at either the federal or provincial level.Addressing the broader issue of the Ministry of Education’s budget allocation is crucial to understanding where the federal education budget is spent, how much is retained at the federal level, and how much is allocated to provinces and local governments. This in turn helps us examine the UGC’s role in managing these funds at the federal level. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating a more effective and equitable education system in Nepal.In the fiscal year 2024-25, the Ministry of Education received Rs203.66 billion, with 28.33 percent (Rs57.70 billion) directed to the federal level, 2.26 percent (Rs4.61 billion) to the provinces and 69.41 percent (Rs141.36 billion) to local levels. Analysing the federal allocation of Rs57.70 billion reveals distinct trends. The UGC leads federal education spending, with its share rising from 23.5 percent in FY 2019-20 to 33.21 percent in FY 2024-25. However, most of this funding is used for operational activities rather than research and innovation. School teacher pensions also comprise a significant portion, accounting for 32.93 percent of the federal budget, limiting investments in infrastructure and innovative programmes.The Central Implementation Unit (CIU), with Rs460 million (7.97 percent), manages major education projects, including externally funded initiatives, but there are concerns about its centralised resource management. The Medical Education Commission (MEC) has seen a notable rise in its allocation, from 1.38 percent to 8.96 percent, reflecting a focus on healthcare workforce development. However, the issue of scholarship recipients often leaving Nepal for better opportunities abroad remains challenging.There has been a slight decrease in budget for programmes such as the Higher Education Promotion Programme (HEPP) and the School Sector Development Programme (SSDP), with overlapping roles between HEPP and UGC causing inefficiencies. The SSDP, later replaced by the School Education Sector Plan (SESP), shifted more funding to provincial and local levels, limiting federal involvement to training, administration and curriculum development. Meanwhile, allocations for the President’s Education Reform Programme (1.52 percent) and the Center for Education and Human Resource Development (CEHRD) (1.47 percent) have been criticised for impractical implementation and centralised budgeting.The President’s Education Reform Programme has bypassed the decision-making authority of local governments. The programme often selects school projects at the federal level, with funds allocated to constituencies linked to influential figures. For instance, in FY 2023-24, Education Minister Devendra Poudel directed a large share of the budget to his home district, Baglung, benefiting 143 schools (Kantipur, March 28, 2024). Similarly, in FY 2024-25, the programme prioritised earthquake-affected schools in Jajarkot and Bajhang. Such practices have raised concerns about equitable resource distribution and the programme’s alignment with decentralised governance principles.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), which manages technical and vocational education, received Rs159.59 million (2.77 percent), indicating slow progress in expanding vocational education. Despite increased funding for coordination units like the Education Development and Coordination Unit, the federal budget prioritises pensions, operational activities and centralised programmes over transformative reforms or addressing systemic gaps. These trends suggest the need to reevaluate federal spending to balance decentralisation goals with efficient resource use and equitable education improvements across all levels.At the provincial level, the FY 2024-25 education budget is Rs4.61 billion (2.26 percent of the total Ministry of Education budget), allocated through a conditional grant from the federal government. The CTEVT dominates provincial allocations, receiving 78.4 percent of the total, highlighting a focus on vocational education and technical training, crucial for developing a skilled workforce. Despite its devolved functions, the National Education Board (NEB) receives only 7.3 percent of the provincial budget, suggesting that its activities remain centrally managed, limiting provincial autonomy.In FY 2024-25, 69.41 percent of Nepal’s Ministry of Education budget—Rs141.36 billion—was allocated to local governments as conditional grants. A large portion of the local education budget, 78.21 percent (Rs. 110.60 billion), is directed toward teacher salaries. This allocation supports community schools comprising 85.1 percent of Nepal’s 27,990 schools. Most of this salary budget (68 percent) is spent on basic-level teachers for Grades 1-5, where 67.3 percent of students are enrolled. While prioritising teacher salaries ensures operational continuity, it restricts the local government’s ability to fund other pressing needs. Globally, decentralisation models advocate for more diversified budget allocation to address broader educational challenges effectively.Programmes like day meal initiatives, which help retain students and address malnutrition, receive only 5.99 percent of the budget (Rs8.47 billion). Free textbook grants, including materials in local languages, account for just 2.7 percent (Rs3.81 billion). These essential programmes suffer from limited funding, particularly in underserved communities.Similarly, funding for infrastructure and educational quality is severely inadequate. Only 1.34 percent of the budget goes to school operation and management grants; performance-based incentives for improving educational outcomes account for just 2.17 percent. Less than 2 percent is allocated to school construction, hindering efforts to modernise and enhance learning environments, particularly in rural areas.The rigid structure of budget allocations under the SESP, with over 91 percent of the budget locked into predefined programmes like salaries, meals, and textbooks, limits local governments’ autonomy to create initiatives tailored to their communities’ specific educational needs. In contrast, international best practices grant local authorities greater decision-making power, enabling them to effectively address diverse and evolving educational demands.Minimal investment in alternative education, digital learning and innovative programmes—each receiving less than 2 percent—also emphasises the need to align local budgets with modern educational goals, such as technology integration, bridging access disparities and fostering innovation. \nThere is growing acknowledgment of macroeconomic stabilisation in recent months. Inflation is down, the current account has posted surpluses for four consecutive months on the back of rising remittances, foreign exchange reserves are growing and export growth, while not spectacular, remains consistent. There is some improvement in real economy figures, such as auto sales and cement dispatches, though overall economic growth is still well below par.Beyond big numbers and the debate on whether they deserve cautious praise or considered caution, it’s worth reflecting on what the past few years meant for the average Pakistani household. Between July 2019 and June 2024, inflation came in under 10 percent in fewer than one-third of all months. It reached astronomic highs above 20 percent consistently between July 2022 and January 2024, decimating consumer spending power by at least half. The World Bank estimates an additional six percent of all households—nearly 15 million people—were pushed into poverty during this period.Poverty brings with it a host of other burdens. Caloric deficits become common as spending on meat, fruit and vegetables goes down; children are withdrawn from fee-paying schools, slowing down human capital accumulation; physical well-being is impacted by curbs on health expenses.The actual scale of these burdens is yet to be determined. Since the Labour Force Survey of 2021, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics has not published any national-level study that can help assess the damage and the extent to which household earnings have lagged inflation. Another usual benchmark, the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement, last came out in 2019.As others have pointed out, the social and political consequences of inflation are already apparent. The PTI’s political upsurge and the mass realignment of voters in urban Punjab, culminating in the 2024 election results, is the most obvious one. The continuing legitimacy crisis on digital media confronting the government and the establishment is another one. Anecdotally, the uptick in legal and illegal migration and disillusionment among white- and blue-collar workers alike are all wreckages from the same crisis. This small window of low inflation should compel a rethink of how the authorities and employers understand the average household’s basic needs.The task at rebuilding an economy that works for the majority and can undo the damage of the past few years is an enormous one. Existing social protection efforts, such as cash transfers through BISP and subsidies at the provincial level, are inadequate. Poorly implemented, randomly assessed and below-par minimum wage regulations consistently come up short as well.This small window of low inflation should compel a rethink of how public authorities and employers understand the average Pakistani household’s basic needs. One alternative proposition is the ‘living wage’ framework, empirically proposed in Pakistan by researchers Kabeer Dawani and Asad Sayeed.The case for a living, rather than minimum wage, is fairly straightforward, existing minimum wage regulations are inadequate and arbitrary and do not cover the actual cost of a decent life for a household in Pakistan. Instead, a new conception is required that can cover a low-cost nutritious diet, basic but acceptable housing and other non-food, non-housing essentials such as clothing, healthcare, transportation and education. Given how the cost of living varies between different locations, the living wage will be different for different regions.In the latest iteration using inflation data from March 2024, Dawani and Sayeed draw up estimates for rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and both urban and rural northeast Punjab. The gross living wage comes in at around Rs67,000 for rural KP, Rs45,000 for rural northeast Punjab and Rs51,000 for urban northeast Punjab.The same figures for April 2021 were Rs35,000, Rs16,000 and Rs20,000 respectively. In three years, the benchmark amount required for decent living has nearly doubled or more across different parts of the country.Updating Labour Force Survey data from 2021 to the present, the authors show that in most basic occupations, workers are making considerably less than their estimated living wage. In some cases, such as for unskilled construction workers in Punjab, the difference is as much as Rs25,000 per month.Egregiously, official minimum wage benchmarks also fall considerably short if measured against this benchmark. In other words, even if minimum wage laws were enforced across all sectors, many workers in elementary occupations would still not be making anywhere close to what they actually need. As the authors rightly argue, the only viable short-term solution to reduce the living wage gap is a reallocation of wasteful subsidies from non-poor to poor households in the shape of expanded cash transfers.Alongside short-term interventions, there needs to be a conclusive acknowledgment of the human cost of Pakistan’s repeated boom-bust cycles. In the past few weeks, Khurram Husain’s writings have alerted us to the possibility that in the quest for a quick win, the government may soon shift its focus from stabilisation to growth. As he has rightly cautioned, in the absence of any meaningful change in domestic productivity, the pursuit of growth through easing up of import controls, provision of subsidised credit, or suppression of energy prices may result in the economy heating up again, leading to another bout of high inflation.These cycles do not impact rich, asset-holding households to any great degree. In fact, the rich make money during both booms and busts. When growth is high, there is money to be made from business activities, real estate and the stock market. When growth crashes and inflation goes up, business owners pass on the cost to consumers and those with excess savings switch to debt-based instruments to make use of the higher interest rates. In all instances, it is common households that bear the brunt of a crash and the stabilisation that follows. And if political realities and public anger are anything to go by, the population’s ability to scrape through another bust is at its end.—Dawn (Pakistan) / ANN \nHow Gagan Thapa wishes there were more than 24 hours in a day! He would then be able to meet most of his social obligations. As preparations get underway for the next Nepali Congress general convention, due at the end of 2025, the party general secretary is routinely inundated with meeting requests. Cadres start lining up outside his Ratopul home early in the morning as Thapa, holed up in the kitchen inside, is busy packing tiffin boxes for his two girls. Now 48, the ex-health minister believes the 15th general convention will be a make or break event for him. He has seen some erosion in his fame following the entry of new forces in Nepali politics. The best way to stem this slide would be to win the party presidency and go into the next general elections as the party’s prime ministerial face.Given the fast pace of change in national politics, he might not get another shot at leading the party—or the country as prime minister. This is why he is keen on mending ties with current President Sher Bahadur Deuba. As things stand, the incumbent president could have the final say in the pick of his successor. “I believe there is an undeclared understanding between the two: Deuba will next lead the government, and Gagan will look after party affairs,” says a trusted adviser of Thapa. In this telling, Deuba realises the futility of pushing his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, up the party hierarchy. She is not a popular figure among the Congress rank and file. So the best bet for Arzu’s continued relevance in the party is to get Thapa to agree to ‘adjusting’ her in some role after Deuba steps down. In case Thapa declines to do so, the desperate husband might conceivably offer a similar bargain to other aspirants for party presidency. Some say the five-time prime minister, the political animal that he is, will not quietly bow out of politics even after he relinquishes the party chair. That he will continue to pull the strings from behind the curtain. That is unlikely. Deuba’s influence in the party, now at its apogee, will at once decline when he is no longer in a position to dole out plum ministries and party posts. Coming back to Thapa, for all his strengths, it would be a mistake to assume the party presidency will fall into his lap. If, for example, Shekhar Koirala is in the fray, Thapa will be going toe to toe with a formidable foe. “In my reckoning, Koirala can beat Thapa if the two face off in the general convention,” says Tula Narayan Shah, a keen political observer while cupping a glass of steaming peach black tea. The general convention representatives vote in blocks. Shah, a Nepali Congress footsoldier in his student days, thinks the Koirala name still carries a lot of weight for many such Congressi blocks. “Or how could Shashank get the most votes in the election for central committee members in the last general convention? What other qualification did he have?” Also working in Koirala’s favour will be his long preparation for the top job— “while never holding a government portfolio,” Shah adds. Moreover, many in the Congress believe that while Thapa has age on his side, and will get another shot in the future, Koirala, at 74, may not have that luxury. But even the first-level elections to choose Congress general convention delegates have not started. It would thus be premature to talk of new factions which will only start solidifying around a handful of leaders at the end of 2025. The likes of Purna Bahadur Khadka and Bimlendra Nidhi, another two aspirations for the top job who too are long-time Deuba acolytes, would have some say in how things shape up. So would Shashank Koirala and Prakash Man Singh. Yet a compelling case can be made for why the Congress would do well to go into the next general elections under Gagan Thapa. With the country looking for a clean break from the past, this next generation leader with sound intellect and unmatched oratory will be a good electoral fit. He also has a clean image. Again, no other top Congress leader is anywhere close to the MP from Kathmandu-4 on any of these fronts. Yes, Thapa’s popularity has gone down. But if he gets to lead the party again, he is more than capable of regaining much of the lost lustre. A leader who is always in the spotlight is bound to get into some controversies. As has Thapa. Someone who came to prominence during the 2006 April Revolution, he can sometimes sound more like a rabble-rouser than a cool-headed thinker. Really, when you have natural swag, why sweat it? His relations with the party chief have also come under scrutiny. Even though Deuba has made one after another mistake, Thapa has blunted his criticism of the party president. Thapa quietly accepted the seven-point midnight Congress-UML deal even though he, the party’s general secretary, was kept in complete darkness. A consummate politician, Thapa is clearly biding his time. But this also shows he thinks long term—always a good sign in a political leader.It would be hard to argue that the Congress and the larger Nepali polity will be better served with the party electing Shekhar Koirala or any other leader of the older generation than it will be by picking Thapa. If Thapa comes to power in the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, the other two big parties, will also be forced to rethink their ossified leaderships: The UML is now under the thumb of KP Sharma Oli, just like Pushpa Kamal Dahal continues to maintain an absolute grip over the Maoist Centre. At this juncture, of the three major forces, the Congress appears by far the most democratic outfit. A seamless transfer of power to the torchbearer of the next generation will reinforce this image.  \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nWeather in western Nepal has begun to change, with the Sudurpaschim province experiencing cloud cover since Monday evening.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nFive months after forming the government led by KP Sharma Oli, coalition partners Nepali Congress and CPN-UML are in the final stages of forming mechanisms to identify the areas for amending the constitution.A major agreement between the Congress and the UML while forming the government in mid-July was to amend the constitution and review provisions that have created difficulties in its implementation.On Tuesday, the constitution amendment process finally entered bilateral talks between the Congress and the UML. An eight-member task force formed to strengthen the relations between the two parties met on Tuesday and discussed initiating the amendment process. “The issue of amendment has finally entered our discussion from today [Tuesday],” a task force member said. “We are currently discussing how to proceed and start wider discussions and consultations. We are considering forming either a political or a non-political taskforce to do the required homework.”The cross-party task force will be led by a senior politician, and comprise members of different political parties. If a non-political task force is formed, it will be led by a former chief justice of the Supreme Court or any other respected legal figure acceptable to all stakeholders. Some Congress and UML leaders have suggested forming a non-political mechanism or taskforce where legal experts, constitutional experts, human rights activists among others can be accommodated and a way ahead can be found as per their suggestions, according to a taskforce member. “We will confront difficult questions if we form a political mechanism,” he said. The meeting lasted three hours and leaders also discussed some ‘neutral’ names who can potentially lead such a mechanism or taskforce. Some political parties in the opposition have already started discussion and deliberations on the issues that need to to be addressed in order to amend the constitution. Point number two of the seven-point agreement signed between the Congress and UML in July stated that the national consensus government under the leadership of Oli would give priority to making necessary amendments to the constitution and formulating laws that ensure political stability by evaluating the strengths and weaknesses as well as the complexities seen in its implementation. “As per the understanding, our party will soon form a mechanism to identify the content for amendment,” said Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak.The Nepali Congress and the UML will soon form separate task forces to identify the contents for amendment in the constitution, Lekhak said at an event in Kathmandu. “The government has also taken an initiative on this.”“The amendment process does not end overnight. It will happen after a series of discussion and deliberations among the parties. We will assess our decade-long experience of constitutional practice and, accordingly, all political parties will sit together and make amendments,” he said.“We will initiate discussions, evaluate and assess the status of the implementation of the constitution, identify the amendment subject matters, and proceed with discussions and deliberations,” said Lekhak.The agreement between the two largest parties to amend the constitution has ignited debate in and outside political circles. Parties are divided on whether this is the right time to make changes in the constitution. But Home Minister Lekhak said the ruling and opposition parties will first review the 10-year journey of the constitution and identify its strengths and weaknesses. Second, the two ruling parties will identify the issues that need to be amended and the ruling and opposition parties will sit together for this. At last, the Congress and UML will reach an agreement on the content for amendment and table it in the house. He also clarified that the amendment to the constitution will strengthen inclusiveness rather than weaken it. The third largest party, the CPN (Maoist Centre), will also soon publicise its position on constitution amendment. The upcoming central committee meeting of the party scheduled to kick off on January 5 will open discussions on the matter, said party spokesperson Agni Prasad Sapkota. “The party has its own position on the amendment but we are open to discussions,” Sapkota said. The party will make its position public only after the meeting of its central committee.“Our position is clear: any amendment to the constitution should be for a progressive cause, not for a regressive cause. It should aim at development and prosperity. Second, there should be a directly elected president for political stability. We must opt for full inclusiveness in both houses of parliament. If we guarantee these issues in the new amendment proposal, the protracted political instability in the country will come to an end,” said Sapkota.Besides the Maoist Centre, other political parties represented in parliament are also doing homework regarding the amendment in the constitution but they are yet to make their position, preparation and homework public.Another party, the CPN (Unified Socialist), on December 17 formed a seven-member task force under party leader Prakash Jwala to work out the party’s position on the constitution amendment process. “We have formed a task force which will come out with some recommendations in this aspect,” said party spokesperson, Jagannath Khatiwada. Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa, speaking at a party function in Kathmandu on Sunday, also said a mechanism to amend the constitution would be formed within a few days. Thapa added that the mechanism would be pragmatic and amendments would be made cautiously.“The debate on amending the constitution has begun,” Thapa said. “Within a few days, the Congress and the UML will form a mechanism. We will handle this cautiously since there is no room for adventures. We will also have a dialogue with other political parties.”He said the constitution cannot be amended just because the Congress and the UML want it. It will be done only after broad consultations among the Maoist, Madhesi and other political forces.“After reaching an agreement with all parties and stakeholders, we will amend minimum provisions necessary to ensure the constitution’s smooth functioning,” Thapa said. \nThree murders occurred in Kathmandu over the weekend: Milan Acharya murdered his father and brother, while Nayan Gurung was killed in a brawl at Town Cafe.\nThe National Human Rights Commision (NHRC) has said the selection of office bearers for the two transitional justice commissions on merit is not possible through the present set-up of the recommendation committee.Explaining the reasons for the failure of the recommendation to pick the office bearers, Manoj Duwadi, a member of the commission, said the recommendation committee dominated by the representatives of the political parties cannot make a right selection.“Only two in the five-member [recommendation] panel are neutral. Three others act as dictated by their parties,” he said at an interaction held by the commission on Tuesday.Duwadi was a member of the former chief justice Om Prakash Mishra-led recommendation committee that exhausted its two-month tenure on December 16 without completing its responsibility. It was tasked with recommending a chairperson and four members each for the Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons.However, it recommended the government start a fresh selection process saying it could not reach consensus in selecting names and recommending names through majority would have lasting implications for the peace process. Other than Mishra and Duwadi, the five-member panel had Arjun Karki, a former ambassador; Khamma Bahadur Khati, former attorney general; and Stella Tamang, a human rights activist.As claimed by Duwadi, Karki represents the CPN-UML, Khati is a Nepali Congress affiliate and Tamang is close to the CPN (Maoist Centre). The Mishra-led panel, which had finalised the rest of the names, couldn’t agree on the name of TRC chairperson.The Congress, which has staked a claim to the position, had pushed for Sudip Pathak, a former NHRC member. It had presented former deputy attorney general Biswaraj Koirala and Sher Bahadur KC, a former president of the Nepal Bar Association. Their names were not endorsed by Mishra and Duwadi for their controversial past or for claims that they were incapable to command the position. “In my personal opinion, the NHRC, if given the responsibility, can select 10 competent office bearers but it is not possible through the present mechanism,” said Duwadi.The commission held the interaction to seek feedback from the stakeholders amid the uncertainty so as to devise the NHRC’s strategy, according to Surya Dhungel, who is the transitional justice focal point at the commission. The victims present in the interaction had conflicting views over the role of the selection committee and how the process should move ahead. Ram Kumar Bhandari, coordinator of the National Network of the Victims of Serious Violations of Human Rights, slammed the recommendation committee and Duwadi for failing to fulfil their responsibility. “You have betrayed us. It was your job to recommend the names. On what legal grounds did you recommend the government start a selection process afresh?” asked Bhandari.“Why did you stretch the selection process until the last day if you knew the committee could not deliver? You have to refund the allowances you took despite wasting crucial two months.”Bhandari even blamed the commission for politicising the selection process.However, other victims opposed Bhandari arguing that it was better not to recommend the name rather than endorsing names taken out of the pockets of political leaders.“We have already waited 18 years and can wait longer but won’t accept perpetrators at the commissions,” said Shankar Budhathoki, a conflict victim. “Why should we accept whatever names these three party leaders project? Better late than have spoilers in the commissions.”He thanked the Mishra-led committee for refusing to recommend the names dictated by the parties. The human rights activists also backed Budhathoki saying that the selection committee was successful in shattering the plan of the major parties to appoint the office bearers on political sharing.“It might take a few more months to select the office bearers but I appreciate how the selection committee dared to refuse to be a rubber stamp of the political parties,” said Charan Prasai, a human rights activist. “The NHRC representative had been betraying [by endorsing the names in the past]. This time he [Duwadi] took a right stand.”As the Mishra-led panel failed to fulfil its responsibility, there are two options left: form a new recommendation committee or give the Mishra-led committee more time to find the right persons. Though the top leaders of the major parties have discussed the matter informally, they are yet to reach an agreement. The United Nations Resident Coordinator’s Office and other diplomatic missions too are interacting with the stakeholders on the matter to devise their position. \nFarmer Ratan Rawat of Chandannath Municipality, Jumla, diversified his farming from traditional paddy cultivation to cash crops like apples and vegetables.He initially used to cultivate paddy only. Rawat is now reducing the paddy cultivation area and increasing the area for apples and vegetables.“I used to transplant paddy on my 10 katthas of land. But for the last four years, I have been cultivating apples and vegetables,” he said. His paddy acreage has now been reduced to six katthas.Most of the farmers in the municipality, engaged in paddy farming, have now switched to cash crops.Khadak Budha, another farmer from the same village, has reduced the paddy field by half. He said he used to produce 30 sacks of paddy until a few years ago, but his output declined to 15 sacks.With the good income from apples and vegetables, Budha reduced the paddy acreage.“Apple is in demand,” said Rawat. Though he had no intention to cut on paddy cultivation, as apple farming started generating good income, he gradually switched to apple production.In the highlands of mid-western Nepal, commercial vegetable and apple farming thrived after paddy started to yield little income and there was a shortage of farmhands. The rise in disease also forced people to switch to cash crops from cereal production.“Vegetable farming generates better income than growing paddy. That’s why farmers shifted to vegetable farming,” said Rawat.Farmers have focused on the production of vegetable seeds as well.Compared to last year, paddy production has declined in Karnali this year. In the current fiscal year, 123,795 tonnes of paddy was produced on 39,763 hectares compared to 124,969 tonnes in the last fiscal year.In Karnali Province, paddy is mainly produced in Surkhet, Salyan, Dailekh and West Rukum. Jajarkot, Jumla, and Kalikot are also some areas where paddy is cultivated.The highest elevation at 3,050 metres is Chhumjul of Jumla, a record altitude where rice is cultivated in Nepal.According to the Ministry of Land Management, Agriculture and Cooperatives, Surkhet produced 52,904 tonnes of paddy, more than the sum of Dailekh’s 25,120 tonnes and Salyan’s 23,630 tonnes. According to the statistics for the past five years, paddy production in Karnali has been continuously declining. In the fiscal year 2019-20, paddy output in Karnali was 151,805 tonnes, which dropped to 137,165 tonnes in 2020-21. The output dropped to 125, 143 tonnes in 2021-22 and rose slightly to 128,000 tonnes in 2022-23. Out of 299,339 hectares of arable land in Karnali, farming is done on 216,880 hectares. Paddy covers 45,468 hectares.According to the statistics, paddy in Surkhet covers 12,679 hectares, followed by 8,313 hectares in Dailekh and 7,078 hectares in Salyan. Similarly, in West Rukum, paddy is cultivated on 3,048 hectares, followed by Kalikot with 3,081 hectares and Jajarkot with 3,063 hectares.Purna Bahadur Thapa, the ministry's information officer, said that output and field of paddy both have declined sharply. “The paddy production area has shrunk, mainly in Surkhet, Dailekh, Jajarkot and Salyan.”Paddy production has dropped due to a lack of irrigation. The rainfall damages irrigation canals in the hilly district. “Lack of rainfall was also a problem. If the rainfall gets delayed, it creates difficulties sowing the seeds. As a result, paddy transplantation is not completed on time,” said Thapa. “The delay in paddy transplantation impacts production.”The provincial government data shows that out of the total irrigable land in Karnali, only 35.21 percent is covered by irrigation facilities. The round-the-year irrigation facility is provided only on 38,338 hectares, while 30,302 hectares are partially irrigated.Thapa said that the farmers also face the problem of insufficient seeds. As farmers have applied new hybrid seeds, new diseases have emerged. The increasing urban area also reduced production and farming land. \nNepal is ahead of many countries in LGBTQIA+ rights and policies. The Constitution of Nepal recognises gender and sexual minorities, which even developed countries like the US don’t explicitly mention. Moreover, the judiciary’s support for the rights of the queer community has increased in recent years. While these achievements seem noteworthy at the outset, there is still a huge disparity between the laws and the reality queer people face every day. In Nepal, while much of the activism for the rights of the LGBTQIA+ community still focuses on something as basic as identity and legal recognition, issues like the sexual and reproductive health rights (SRHR) of these communities remain overlooked. Although the Constitution of Nepal ensures fundamental rights, such as reproductive rights under the Safe Motherhood and Reproductive Health Act (2018) for gender and sexual minorities, these provisions haven’t effectively catered to the sexual and reproductive health of these communities.The discrimination and stigma that gender and sexual minorities face daily manifests in their general inaccessibility of fundamental rights in Nepal. Programmes related to SRHR are usually associated with cisgender women and ignore LGBTQIA+ individuals. Queer folks are judged and ridiculed not just by their family members but also by the health staff at hospitals and health posts. This is problematic in a country where transgender people are forced to undergo surgery for medical verification to be legally recognised as “male” or “female”. Gender-affirming surgery requires medical professionals to follow certain clinical protocols; however, the existing law does not address gender reassignment. In August, the Supreme Court made landmark progress in recognising LGBTQIA+ rights by ruling that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, must be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without requiring medical verification; however, the law for legal recognition remains the same for all. So, these individuals have no option but to travel to India for surgeries, which can be expensive and unsafe. Moreover, transgender men, lesbians and bisexual individuals often struggle to access basic menstrual hygiene products and healthcare facilities related to safe motherhood and abortion. The path to having and parenting children is fraught with difficulties for queer individuals, as IVF and adoption facilities aren’t accessible. While surrogacy is legal for infertile married Nepali couples, it is prohibited for singles, transgender couples and foreign nationals.Many people have the misconception that only cisgender women menstruate, but anyone with a uterus can experience it. These narratives arise through the limited awareness of our society and restrictive school curriculums. Such a perpetuation of false ideas further influences dominant ideas in popular platforms. Rarely do we see people from the LGBTQIA+ communities in the advertisements of sanitary pads or contraceptives. These communities often receive attention only during Pride Month (June), but progress in SRHR and other issues requires ongoing efforts, not just a month of focus.The legal recognition of same-sex marriage between Surendra Pandey and Maya Gurung in 2023 made many hopeful about the future of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ individuals. Conversations about the potential of Nepal’s LGBTQIA+ tourism (rainbow tourism) have emerged since. To ensure its sustainability, we must prioritise fundamentals such as SRHR for the queer communities to create a safe space for them. For our economy to benefit from their participation, it must ensure that their primary needs are met with dignity.Our leaders cannot dismiss the issues of queer people by relying on the superficial claims of LGBTQIA+ policy advancements. Yes, there has been progress, but it is not enough. Lawmakers must understand that queer rights go beyond sexuality and identity and include all aspects of human rights, such as the right to sexual and reproductive health. Laws can only go so far if we do not change our deeply rooted beliefs and accept people for who they are while providing essential services. \nOn December 19, 2024, the veteran communist leader and upper-house parliamentarian Bamdev Gautam caused quite a stir in the Dalit community by suggesting that the word ‘Dalit’ must be removed from official documents, including the constitution and the law. He made a fallacious argument that removing the word Dalit from all written documents would somehow emancipate that community and guarantee their rights.Speaking to the National Assembly’s Development, Economic Affairs and Good Governance, Gautam said, “Let’s remove the term Dalit from our dictionary… On the one hand, we decry discrimination against Dalits and the infringement of their rights; but on the other, our language, acts, constitution, law as well as document written by the scholars all refer to them as Dalits.” No doubt, Dalit has become a controversial term over the years, even within the Dalit community. Social media is full of comments from ordinary people, most of whom are upper castes, where the word is presented as a kind of license to dominate and discriminate against the “untouchables”. And, strangely, some Dalits themselves tend to agree! Especially the younger generation of Dalits, particularly those from the towns and with some opportunities and privileges, harbour a degree of disgust with the word. They think Dalit identity, Dalit quotas and Dalit literature have further exposed them to discrimination. There’s some truth in that, of course, but it’s a mistaken understanding.But this is the first time a senior communist politician—a former deputy prime minister and home minister—has expressed his anger at the Dalit word. How do we understand this attitude of a senior politician towards us? What does he want by attacking Dalit identity, one wonders: True liberation of Dalits or the end of their limited access to power and privilege?A nonsensical argumentGautam’s assertion on removing the word Dalit from legal and official documents and literature apparently for their own sake doesn’t make any sense. There’s no evidence to suggest that simply getting rid of a word automatically liberates the community from traditional oppression. There’s the glaring case of India. The Dalits of this country started using the term Dalit as their self-identification centuries ago. However, the Constitution of independent India, passed by the Constituent Assembly on November 29, 1949, doesn’t refer to any caste or community as a “Dalit”. The untouchables have been constitutionally and legally identified as the “scheduled caste” instead.A question to respected Gautam is: Has the avoidance of the term Dalit from the official lingo in India really contributed to the emancipation of Dalits? Has this policy really stopped the practice of untouchability in society? The answer is, squarely, no!In contrast, the usage of the term Dalit in Nepal is quite recent. The political movements of the “untouchables”, often supported by the Nepali Congress Party and the communist parties, borrowed it from India and started using it in their movements only seven decades ago. But we’ve been subjugated, exploited, separated and humiliated as “untouchables”, following Hindu laws, from centuries ago, well before the unification of Nepal by Prithvi Narayan Shah in the mid-18th century. It’s important to keep in mind, therefore, that the significant section of the Nepali population currently recognised as Dalits have been suppressed and tormented, including through state laws and policies (such as the Muluki Ain of 1854), since long before the use of the term came into use. Is it fair then to lay the entire blame of Dalit suffering on what I would consider an innocent word?Change culture, not literature Nobody would suggest that one word or one form of identity should be established forever. Healthy debates and discussions on any identification must be welcomed and encouraged. It’s a good idea to change communal identity befitting the changing times. But this should happen amongst the concerned groups themselves; upper-caste leaders like Gautam must not intervene.But many of us hold that this is not the time to argue against using the term Dalit. For one thing, unlike humiliating terms like untouchable and water-unusable and low caste and small caste, Dalit identity wasn’t forced upon us by the state or the religion. The state started using this term, instead of the other highly stigmatised terms mentioned above, according to our own needs and demands. Moreover, it’s crazy to think that simply removing the word would remove the stigma of caste and minimise caste hatred against us. It’s not that simple, is it? In this futile exercise, various Dalit groups have adopted new surnames including some resembling the prestigious upper-caste surnames. The Kami and Damai each has more than two hundred family names! A fake family name would provide a degree of cover against caste prejudice in unfamiliar social settings—but that doesn’t, and hasn’t, in any way, liberated anybody from the traditional forms of exclusion and humiliation. We recently met with former prime minister and Maoist chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal “Prachanda”, who agreed with our assertion that political changes alone haven’t changed the situation of Dalits on the ground. What is truly required is a separate “cultural revolution” against the caste system. I’ve heard some other senior politicians from across the party spectrum express a similar sentiment. Neither Dahal nor we meant here the cultural revolution conducted by Chairman Mao in China in 1967-76. I’ve long advocated the need for religious and cultural reforms to tackle the entrenched problem of caste discrimination in this country. The key to our success. People often frown at our assertion to conduct religious reform, maintaining that it’s impossible to amend Brahmanism. True, religious texts like Manusmriti can’t be reviewed as easily as a constitution or law. But that doesn’t mean religious traditions and beliefs can’t be corrected according to changing times. Our society has undergone many religious and cultural reforms in recent years. Upper castes no longer require ritual purification after returning from sea voyages. Intercaste marriage is quite common and acceptable, among non-Dalits in particular. Today’s Bahuns are free to drink alcohol, eat with other castes, play drums, run iron workshops and tailoring shops. Society has been far more rigid when it comes to reforming the religion and culture to guarantee the constitutional and legal rights of Dalits. That’s the last push we must all attempt. Despite the strong inertia, the state can reform religious and cultural beliefs and practices, with the aid of modern laws. Dalit freedom fighters must pressure the ruling class to work in that direction. We all want to break the chain of Dalitness. We have no pride in being born a Dalit. It’s an identity that should be dumped in the dustbin of history. But we will only become free from Dalit identity when the rituals and customs get rid of the practice of untouchability.  \nThroughout Nepal’s legal history, juvenile justice has remained a neglected issue. Only after Nepal ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) on September 14, 1990, did the concept of justice for children begin. The commitment also led Nepal to introduce the Children’s Act, 2048 (1992). The Act served as the first-ever legislation related to children and their rights. While it was a landmark step for the security of children, it still fell short of our expectations.The act was weak and outdated with vague provisions and inadequate protections for children who fell into conflict with the law. So, the call for a more comprehensive legal framework grew louder. This demand cultivated an environment for formulating the Act Relating to Children 2018, which strengthened Nepal’s juvenile justice framework. However, despite the advancements, challenges remain as the law fails to bridge the gap between law and practice.Under the fourth subsection of Provision 43 in the 2018 Act, it is stipulated that “when a juvenile offender reaches the age of eighteen while still serving their sentence, they aren’t to be transferred to an adult prison, but rather to a special facility”. A special facility for those transitioning from juvenile centres to adult prisons was attempted, but it didn’t materialise, likely due to logistical challenges. As a result, juveniles as young as 12 years are housed alongside individuals nearing 30. This practice alone has been overcrowding juvenile facilities. When supported by a weakly enforced law, this system blatantly contradicts the CRC, which prohibits the housing of juvenile convicts with adult convicts.Earlier this year, in conversation with the director of the Underprivileged Children’s Educational Programme (UCEP)—an organisation advocating for child rights—I discovered that all eight of Nepal’s juvenile detention centres have a combined capacity of just 390. But more than 1,300 delinquents are kept in these facilities, which creates severe overcrowding.The effects of overcrowded facilities extend beyond logistical challenges. They also leave a harmful mark on the psychological, intellectual and moral development of the juveniles. Undoubtedly, an individual’s growth is heavily influenced by their surroundings. The young mind is malleable, and when put in an environment far from conducive, the chances of them adopting harmful behaviours are sky-high. The recent incidents in Nepal’s juvenile centres highlight a serious dysfunction. For instance, this July, the Jayandu Juvenile Correction Centre in Banke saw a violent delinquent-led outburst, marking a third such incident of its kind in just 12 months. These clashes, which resulted in deaths and numerous injuries, accentuate the need to address the systemic flaws in our judicial system. However, when discussing the issue, it is equally crucial to note that the roots of these problems don’t just lie in our flawed legal system. They are deeply connected with the socioeconomic realities of incarcerated children.From my interview with the UCEP, I found that 95 percent of these young delinquents come from struggling, impoverished families. These are children who have never known a life beyond their huts and farming; children who aren’t familiar with financial peace; children who battle to survive each day; children who commit crimes, unaware that it makes them criminals. This is a situation born out of legal illiteracy. The level of legal literacy among the youth in urban centres like Kathmandu itself is weak and the concept is practically foreign in the villages. As a student, I believe that a good part of this shortcoming is a direct reflection of the weakness of our education system. While the government-issued school-level curriculum includes topics related to the constitution and the legal system, the content merely scratches the surface. The coursebooks enlist laws, yet they fail to inform about the consequences of breaking them. Our curriculum omits crucial details about the legal process, like the trial system, juvenile detention centres and what follows the commission of a crime. This superficial approach leaves students with minimal knowledge on our rights and responsibilities, making us vulnerable to unintentional infractions.However, it would be unfair to place the entire blame on the curriculum alone, as society, too, plays a big role in this issue. With limited public discourse on legal rights, provisions and consequences, our society is failing the youth. I’ve witnessed that society often consumes itself with discussions on matters unrelated to our immediate concerns. They fail to devote time and attention to educating the young about the legal system governing them. If we allocate even a fraction of our focus to legal education, especially for the youths, the next generation will be safe from falling into conflict with the law.Ultimately, this failure to provide comprehensive legal education, by both the curriculum and civil society, leaves us with only a shallow understanding of our rights and responsibilities as citizens. This lack of awareness makes us highly vulnerable within the justice system, where ignorance invites consequences. So I ask, why should children bear the title of convict if they are unaware that their normality is a federal offence? Why should they pay the price for the weakness of the government-issued curriculum? It’s about time we shifted our approach. We must establish a society where juveniles can find security in lawmakers and law enforcement officers. Educators must never forget that legal advancements are only effective with proper implementation.  \nNepal’s dairy sector has for long been under financial strain. The cost of milk and milk products has spiked so much that many households have cut down on (or entirely stopped) their consumption. The price of processed milk, which was Rs76 a litre in January 2022, has climbed up to Rs120 a litre. Dairy products from Uttar Pradesh of India that are comparatively cheaper (INR62 or Rs100 a litre) are also smuggled into the country. As a result of reduced demand and steady imports of cheap products, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation now has a stockpile of 600 tonnes of butter and 500 tonnes of powdered milk, and the farmers are yet to get Rs580 million the cash-strapped DDC owes them. Farmers, dismayed by the delays in payment, have often had to take to the streets.In an effort to settle the problem, the DDC has started exploring domestic private as well as international markets. To start with, it has agreed to supply 1,000 kg of raw cheese or whey (used to make chhurpi which is also called hard cheese) to a private company daily, starting December 30. The DDC will need 10,000 litres of milk a day to do so. The company, Himalayan Dog Chew, owned by the Manaram Group, exports chhurpi to the United States. Known as dog chew in the West, chhurpi is quite popular and in high demand among the owners of pooches in the US and Canada. But exporters in Nepal have struggled to meet the demand. So the deal between the private company and the DDC couldn’t have come at a better time. The dairy corporation has, for the first time, collaborated with the private sector to sell its products. But there’s still a lot of work to be done. As reported in Kantipur, the Post’s sister publication, eastern Nepal has a huge potential to export hard cheese, and some small dairy firms and farmers, with their own efforts, are selling these products in India without branding them. If Nepal could brand them and strike multiple such partnerships with more private companies in the countries in its immediate neighborhood, it could be to the benefit of both the DDC and the dairy farmers. Exporting milk products with the help of the private sector could bring relief to the farmers and the broader dairy industry. However, the success of this initiative is contingent on strong coordination between private companies and farmers. To facilitate this, the dairy corporation should establish a clear mechanism to get the milk from the farmers, who are at the start of the supply chain, to the exporters, who are at the end. There should also be a lot more coordination. For instance, while the demand for chhurpi is healthy, the butter that emerges during dog chew production doesn’t get the market. As the DDC is also planning to export butter to Tibet and to the larger Chinese markets, establishing a seamless channel of trade and communication between the farmers, the DDC and the private buyers would be vital. If China agrees to Nepal’s export proposal, experts say that the DDC’s products will not stockpile. With a little more thought put into the process, it could be a win-win prospect for all three sides.   \nTalks on seafood trade are expected to be on the agenda on Wednesday when Japan’s foreign minister visits China, Japan’s largest export market for aquatic products until Beijing placed a blanket ban in protest against Tokyo releasing treated radioactive wastewater into the ocean.It would be Takeshi Iwaya’s first visit to the Chinese capital since he became Japan’s foreign minister in October and he is scheduled to hold talks with China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi and meet other Chinese officials.A major sticking point in bilateral trade has been Japan’s Fukushima nuclear plant wastewater discharge. Beijing had strongly opposed and condemned Tokyo’s decision on that and tightened inspections on Japanese goods in response.China imposed a full ban in August last year after Japan began releasing the treated radioactive water but both governments reached an agreement in September that would set a path toward restarting seafood shipments from Japan to China.Nikkei reported this week that China was contemplating lifting the import ban on Japanese seafood.But China still wants reassurances from Tokyo that it would fulfil its commitment to setting up a long-term international monitoring arrangement and allowing stakeholders such as China to conduct independent sampling and monitoring of the treated water.With sufficient monitoring, China will “adjust relevant measures” and gradually restore imports that meet standards and regulations, a foreign ministry spokesperson said on Tuesday.The one-day visit follows an agreement between leaders of both countries that they will work towards a mutually beneficial strategic relationship, strengthening communication at various levels.Relations between the neighbouring countries are in a “critical period of improvement and development”, Chinese President Xi Jinping said last month when he met Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Lima, Peru.Xi said both should “be partners, not threats”.Trade partners with close economic and investment ties but rivals in security and territorial claims, China-Japan ties are complicated with long-standing geopolitical disagreements and historical wartime sensitivities.The first Japanese foreign minister to visit since April last year, Iwaya may raise his country’s concerns about Chinese military activities around Japan as well as regional issues including North Korea.Japan expressed “grave concern” last month over North Korea’s security alliance with Russia in which North Korea stands to gain advanced military technology and combat experience.Ukrainian and allied assessments show Pyongyang has sent around 12,000 troops to support Russia’s war in Ukraine. Ukraine warned this week that North Korea could send more personnel and equipment for Moscow’s army.On less testy topics, China could prod Japan for reciprocity in visa policies.China last month expanded its visa-free arrangements to include Japan until the end of 2025, restoring a policy that was suspended during the pandemic.The country, which has been adding countries to its visa-free list, also extended the stay period from 15 days to 30. Japanese citizens were able to enter China without a visa for up to 14 days before COVID-19.Japan has not decided on a reciprocal move but China has said it hopes Japan would work towards improving people exchanges between the two countries. \nThe holiday season has its rules, from its distinct colour palette to the cold weather. Listen closely, and you can hear the sound of bells jingling with their particular charm.If you are like me, the best thing to do during this time of year is to make yourself cosy in bed, wrap your blanket tightly, and snooze the alarm until the very last minute before being pulled by daily mundane routine. But once you start to see the familiar shades of red and white peeking through the decorations and hear the distinct tune of ‘All I Want for Christmas Is You’ by Mariah Carey blasting through every department store you visit, with the smell of cocoa drifting through the air, you begin to grin from ear to ear, knowing that the holiday season is here. For me, this time of year is all about my friends and family, the warmth they provide through their presence, the never-ending chats, hand warmers, and not to forget my annual passionate love affair with electric heaters! (Trust me, we two are inseparable!). The sounds of carols and bells reinforce my passion for baking, but then again, it might just be the cold weather tempting me to make something special for my loved ones to reciprocate the warmth and affection they provide me.

Madhesh, Lumbini, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces are experiencing generally cloudy conditions, while other parts of the country have partial to clear skies. Fog and mist were observed in a few locations in the Tarai and the Kathmandu Valley this morning. Light snowfall is expected in some high hilly and Himalayan areas, with fog or mist likely in the Tarai and the Valley during the early hours.   \nThe National Assembly chair, deputy chair, lawmakers and other officials from the federal parliament came together at an event in Kathmandu on Tuesday to discuss the current state of implementation of federalism in the country and ways to strengthen the federal system, which has been practiced in Nepal since 2017.National Assembly Chairman Narayan Prasad Dahal said that there were some mistakes in the course of practicing the newly adopted system. “Many have expected better delivery, economic prosperity and social justice, among other things, in the federal system,” Dahal said while addressing the interaction titled ‘Federalism, National Assembly and the tasks ahead’ jointly organised by the National Assembly and Federalism and Localisation Centre in Kathmandu on Tuesday. “Honestly speaking, there have been some shortcomings.”Bimala Ghimire, vice-chair of the Assembly, said that the upper house should play more role in strengthening the provincial and local levels.Former lawmaker Khim Lal Devkota, who is also chairman of the Centre, showcased a presentation on the issues raised in the seven provincial assemblies. Assembly Secretary Surendra Aryal explained the practices implemented by the Assembly and plans ahead.Parliamentary party leaders Narayankaji Shrestha of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Beduram Bhusal of CPN (Unified Socialist), and general secretary of the parliament secretariat Padam Prasad Pandey, among other officials, also spoke about strengthening the federal system.Lawmakers representing various provinces and dozens of other lawmakers and experts working in the field brainstormed about ways to strengthen the federal system, particularly the provinces. \nSouth Africa will field debutant Corbin Bosch in their first test against Pakistan, starting on Boxing Day, as captain Temba Bavuma revealed the line-up on Tuesday.Bosch features in an all-seamer bowling line-up and will be playing on his home ground at Centurion, winning a test cap just days after making his one day international debut on Sunday, hitting 40 not out and taking one wicket as South Africa lost to Pakistan at the Wanderers in Johannesburg.The 30-year-old Bosch joins Marco Jansen, Kagiso Rabada and Dane Paterson in the home attack, getting an opportunity because of a long injury list that sees Ottneil Baartman, Nandre Burger, Gerald Coetzee, Wiaan Mulder, Lungi Ngidi, Anrich Nortje and Lizaad Williams all out because of injury or lack of fitness.\"It's one thing making your debut, but then to make it where you've made a name for yourself in the provincial setup is another thing,\" Bavuma said of Bosch at a press conference on Tuesday.\"I think Corbin adds an extra element to our bowling attack, he comes with the extra pace. Obviously, a big, strong guy as well, so one of the guys who can hit the deck hard.\"And he obviously offers a role with the bat as well. We saw in the ODI that he can hold his own with the bat. We're excited for him to see what he can do with the red ball and strengthen our bowling line-up,\" added the South Africa captain.Chasing WinThe all-pace attack means frontline spinner Keshav Maharaj sits out. \"I think it's no different to what we've generally gone with. We back our seamers here in Centurion and nothing has changed,\" Bavuma said.South Africa are chasing a win that would guarantee them a place in next June’s World Test Championship, as they sit top of the standings after winning their last five tests.\"We accept and acknowledge the fact that expectation has risen. There will be pressure that comes with that, but to be honest with you, we’re coming into the series to win the series 2-0, but we understand for us to do that, there's certain things that we need to do as a team.\"Keep things simple, keep doing the small things right and allowing the result to take care of itself,\" he added.South Africa team: Tony de Zorzi, Aiden Markram, Ryan Rickelton, Tristan Stubbs, Temba Bavuma (captain), David Bedingham, Kyle Verreynne (wicketkeeper), Marco Jansen, Corbin Bosch, Kagiso Rabada, Dane Paterson. \nSouth Korea’s main opposition party vowed on Tuesday to impeach acting president Han Duck-soo but reversed an earlier plan and decided to wait until later in the week, party officials said, as the risk of further political uncertainty heightened.The move comes as the country is reeling from impeached President Yoon Suk Yeol's short-lived bid to impose martial law on December 3 that he partly blamed on the opposition's propensity to impeach government officials.Opposition Democratic Party (DP) floor leader Park Chan-dae said the party will wait until later this week to decide whether to go ahead with the plan to impeach Han. Earlier, the party said it would introduce a bill to impeach Han on Tuesday.The DP, which has a majority in parliament, is taking the step after Han postponed signing legislation to launch a special counsel investigation into President Yoon Suk Yeol's failed bid to impose martial law.It said Han was acting against the will of the people, effectively aiding Yoon, whose powers have been suspended after parliament voted to impeach him on December 14.Once an impeachment bill is submitted then formally introduced at a plenary session, it must be voted on within 24 to 72 hours.If Han is impeached, the finance minister would be next in line to lead the government as acting president, according to South Korean law.The penguins were cute, and the staff appearing in a Santa costume made the show exciting and very cute.Prime Minister Han took over from the suspended Yoon, who faces a Constitutional Court review on whether to oust him or restore his powers.“Acting president Han made it clear at today's cabinet meeting that he would not greenlight the special prosecution law,” the DP's Park said.“There is no way to interpret it other than that he is delaying time.”With its parliamentary majority, the DP passed bills this month to appoint a special counsel to pursue charges of insurrection, among others, against the conservative Yoon, and to investigate his wife over a luxury bag scandal and other allegations.An unnamed high-ranking official from Han's office called the DP’s move to impeach Han “highly regrettable”, the Newsis news agency said.“The international community is currently supporting the acting president system ... Impeachment could undermine that trust, and adversely affect the economy,” Newsis cited the official as saying.Han’s office could not immediately be reached for comment.Yoon’s ruling People Power Party (PPP) has accused the DP of threatening to topple the government for not complying with their demands, at a time when South Korea’s key ally the United States has just restarted planned communications with the country under Han's stewardship.Yoon has yet to announce his legal team or appear publicly since a televised statement on December 14, the day parliament impeached him.Seok Dong-hyeon, a lawyer advising Yoon, told reporters on Tuesday that Yoon is unlikely to appear for questioning on Wednesday, Christmas Day, in answer to a summons by authorities investigating his move to impose martial law.Yoon is prioritising the Constitutional Court's trial, Seok said. \nIt’s a simple but brutal equation: The number of people going hungry or otherwise struggling around the world is rising, while the amount of money the world’s wealthiest nations are contributing toward helping them is dropping.The result: The United Nations says that, at best, it will be able to raise enough money to help about 60 percent of the 307 million people it predicts will need humanitarian aid next year. That means at least 117 million people won’t get food or other assistance in 2025.The UN also will end 2024 having raised about 46 percent of the $49.6 billion it sought for humanitarian aid across the globe, its own data shows. It’s the second year in a row the world body has raised less than half of what it sought. The shortfall has forced humanitarian agencies to make agonizing decisions, such as slashing rations for the hungry and cutting the number of people eligible for aid.The consequences are being felt in places like Syria, where the World Food Program (WFP), the UN’s main food distributor, used to feed 6 million people. Eyeing its projections for aid donations earlier this year, the WFP cut the number it hoped to help there to about 1 million people, said Rania Dagash-Kamara, the organization’s assistant executive director for partnerships and resource mobilization.Dagash-Kamara visited the WFP's Syria staff in March. “Their line was, ‘We are at this point taking from the hungry to feed the starving,’” she said in an interview.UN officials see few reasons for optimism at a time of widespread conflict, political unrest and extreme weather, all factors that stoke famine. “We have been forced to scale back appeals to those in most dire need,” Tom Fletcher, UN under-secretary-general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator, told Reuters.Financial pressures and shifting domestic politics are reshaping some wealthy nations’ decisions about where and how much to give. One of the UN’s largest donors – Germany – already shaved $500 million in funding from 2023 to 2024 as part of general belt tightening. The country’s cabinet has recommended another $1 billion reduction in humanitarian aid for 2025. A new parliament will decide next year’s spending plan after the federal election in February.Humanitarian organizations also are watching to see what US President-elect Donald Trump proposes after he begins his second term in January.Trump advisers have not said how he will approach humanitarian aid, but he sought to slash US funding in his first term. And he has hired advisers who say there is room for cuts in foreign aid.The US plays the leading role in preventing and combating starvation across the world. It provided $64.5 billion in humanitarian aid over the last five years. That was at least 38 percent of the total such contributions recorded by the UN.Sharing the Wealth The majority of humanitarian funding comes from just three wealthy donors: the US, Germany and the European Commission. They provided 58 percent of the $170 billion recorded by the UN in response to crises from 2020 to 2024.Three other powers – China, Russia and India – collectively contributed less than 1 percent of UN-tracked humanitarian funding over the same period, according to a Reuters review of UN contributions data.The inability to close the funding gap is one of the major reasons the global system for tackling hunger and preventing famine is under enormous strain. The lack of adequate funding – coupled with the logistical hurdles of assessing need and delivering food aid in conflict zones, where many of the worst hunger crises exist – is taxing efforts to get enough aid to the starving. Almost 282 million people in 59 countries and territories were facing high levels of acute food insecurity in 2023. Reuters is documenting the global hunger-relief crisis in a series of reports, including from hard-hit Sudan, Myanmar and Afghanistan.The failure of major nations to pull their weight in funding for global initiatives has been a persistent Trump complaint. Project 2025, a set of policy proposals drawn up by Trump backers for his second term, calls on humanitarian agencies to work harder to collect more funding from other donors and says this should be a condition for additional US aid.On the campaign trail, Trump tried to distance himself from the controversial Project 2025 blueprint. But after winning the election, he chose one of its key architects, Russell Vought, to run the US Office of Management and Budget, a powerful body that helps decide presidential priorities and how to pay for them. For secretary of state, the top US diplomat, he tapped Florida Senator Marco Rubio, who has a record of supporting foreign aid.Project 2025 makes particular note of conflict – the very factor driving most of today’s worst hunger crises.“Humanitarian aid is sustaining war economies, creating financial incentives for warring parties to continue fighting, discouraging governments from reforming, and propping up malign regimes,” the blueprint says. It calls for deep cuts in international disaster aid by ending programs in places controlled by “malign actors.”Billionaire Elon Musk has been tapped by Trump to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), a new body that will examine waste in government spending. Musk said this month on his social media platform, X, that DOGE would look at foreign aid.The aid cuts Trump sought in his first term didn’t pass Congress, which controls such spending. Senator Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican and close Trump ally on many issues, will chair the Senate committee that oversees the budget. In 2019, he called “insane” and “short-sighted” a Trump proposal to cut the budget for foreign aid and diplomacy by 23 percent.Graham, Vought, Rubio and Musk did not respond to questions for this report.Olympics and SpaceshipsSo many people have been hungry in so many places for so long that humanitarian agencies say fatigue has set in among donors. Donors receive appeal after appeal for help, yet have limits on what they can give. This has led to growing frustration with major countries they view as not doing their share to help.Jan Egeland was UN humanitarian chief from 2003 to 2006 and now heads the Norwegian Refugee Council, a nongovernmental relief group. Egeland said it is “crazy” that a tiny country like Norway is among the top funders of humanitarian aid. With a 2023 gross national income (GNI) less than 2 percent the size of America’s, Norway ranked seventh among governments who gave to the UN that year, according to a Reuters review of UN aid data. It provided more than $1 billion.Two of the five biggest economies – China and India – gave a tiny fraction as much.China ranked 32nd among governments in 2023, contributing $11.5 million in humanitarian aid. It has the world’s second-largest GNI.India ranked 35th that year, with $6.4 million in humanitarian aid. It has the fifth-largest GNI.Egeland noted that China and India each invested far more in the type of initiatives that draw world attention. Beijing spent billions hosting the 2022 Winter Olympics, and India spent $75 million in 2023 to land a spaceship on the moon.“How come there is not more interest in helping starving children in the rest of the world?” Egeland said. “These are not developing countries anymore. They are having Olympics ... They are having spaceships that many of the other donors never could dream of.”Liu Pengyu, spokesman for the Chinese embassy in Washington, said China has always supported the WFP. He noted that it feeds 1.4 billion people within its own borders. “This in itself is a major contribution to world food security,” he said.India’s ambassador to the UN and its Ministry of External Affairs did not respond to questions for this report.To analyze giving patterns, Reuters used data from the UN’s Financial Tracking Service, which records humanitarian aid. The service primarily catalogs money for UN initiatives and relies on voluntary reporting. It doesn’t list aid funneled elsewhere, including an additional $255 million that Saudi Arabia reported giving this year through its own aid organization, the King Salman Humanitarian Aid & Relief Centre.Restrictions and DelaysWhen aid does come, it is sometimes late, and with strings attached, making it hard for humanitarian organizations to respond flexibly to crises.Aid tends to arrive “when the animals are dead, people are on the move, and children are malnourished,” said Julia Steets, director of the Global Public Policy Institute, a think tank based in Berlin.Steets has helped conduct several UN-sponsored evaluations of humanitarian responses. She led one after a drought-driven hunger crisis gripped Ethiopia from 2015 to 2018. The report concluded that while famine was avoided, funding came too late to prevent a huge spike in severe acute malnutrition in children. Research shows that malnutrition can have long-term effects on children, including stunted growth and reduced cognitive abilities.Further frustrating relief efforts are conditions that powerful donors place on aid. Donors dictate details to humanitarian agencies, down to where food will go. They sometimes limit funding to specific UN entities or nongovernmental organizations. They often require that some money be spent on branding, such as displaying donors’ logos on tents, toilets and backpacks.Aid workers say such earmarking has forced them to cut rations or aid altogether.The US has a long-standing practice of placing restrictions on nearly all of its contributions to the World Food Program, one of the largest providers of humanitarian food assistance. More than 99% of US donations to the WFP carried restrictions in each of the last 10 years, according to WFP data reviewed by Reuters.Asked about the aid conditions, a spokesperson for the US Agency for International Development, which oversees American humanitarian spending, said the agency acts “in accordance with the obligations and standards required by Congress.”Those standards aim to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of humanitarian aid, the spokesperson said, and aid conditions are meant to maintain “an appropriate measure of oversight to ensure the responsible use of US taxpayer funds.”Some current and former officials with donor organizations defend their restrictions. They point to theft and corruption that have plagued the global food aid system.In Ethiopia, as Reuters has detailed, massive amounts of aid from the UN World Food Program were diverted , in part because of the organisation’s lax administrative controls. An internal WFP report on Sudan identified a range of problems in the organization’s response to an extreme hunger crisis there, Reuters reported earlier this month, including an inability to react adequately and what the report described as “anti-fraud challenges.”The UN has a “zero tolerance policy” toward “interferences” that disrupt aid and is working with donors to manage risks, said Jens Laerke, spokesperson for the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.Solving the UN’s broader fundraising challenges will require a change in its business model, said Martin Griffiths, who stepped down as UN humanitarian relief chief in June. “Obviously, what we need to do is to have a different source of funding.”In 2014, Antonio Guterres, now the UN’s secretary-general and then head of its refugee agency, suggested a major change that would charge UN member states fees to fund humanitarian initiatives. The UN’s budget and peacekeeping missions already are funded by a fee system. Such funding would offer humanitarian agencies more flexibility in responding to need.The UN explored Guterres’ idea in 2015. But donor countries preferred the current system, which lets them decide case by case where to send contributions, according to a UN report on the proposal.Laerke said the UN is working to diversify its donor base.“We can’t just rely on the same club of donors, generous as they are and appreciative as we are of them,” Laerke said. \nNepali all-rounder Kushal Malla is set to play in the International League T20 (ILT20) in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) after being signed by the Desert Vipers. The franchise brought Malla on board to replace injured Dutch all-rounder Bas de Leede.Desert Vipers’ Director of Cricket, Tom Moody, expressed confidence in Malla’s abilities, stating, “He is a young player but has already gained significant experience at the highest level.”Malla is currently Nepal’s fifth-highest run-scorer in T20 internationals, amassing 917 runs in 47 matches, including one century and four half-centuries. Notably, he scored an unbeaten 137 runs off 50 balls against Mongolia in the Asian Games, reaching his century in just 34 deliveries. Additionally, he has taken 43 wickets in both ODI and T20 international formats combined and has 768 runs in 39 ODIs.The Desert Vipers, runners-up in the inaugural ILT20 season, are set to face the Abu Dhabi Knight Riders in the opening match of the 2025 edition. The team boasts an impressive roster, including Alex Hales, Colin Munro, Rohan Mustafa, Wanindu Hasaranga, Sherfane Rutherford, Sheldon Cottrell, Tom Curran, Sam Billings, Luke Wood, Dinesh Chandimal, and Ruben Trumpelmann.The Desert Vipers is a professional Twenty20 franchise cricket team competing in the Emirati International League T20. \nMilan Acharya, who had been absconding following the Balkot incident, turned himself in at the Maharajgunj Police Circle on Tuesday morning.According to police sources, Acharya has confessed to killing his father and younger brother.The bodies of 56-year-old Kul Prasad Acharya and his 22-year-old son Prabin Acharya were discovered on Monday in separate rooms of their residence in ward 2 of Suryabinayak Municipality, Balkot.“We found the father and younger son dead after breaking into the house on Monday morning. Their bodies were in separate rooms,” said Deputy Superintendent of Police Dhundiraj Neupane, spokesperson for Bhaktapur District Police Range. The younger son’s body was found on a bed in a makeshift kitchen, while the father’s body was in another room. Both had injuries below their ears. Police recovered a traditional stone grinder and a dumbbell with blood and hair at the scene. The Acharya brothers had been renting a ground-floor room in the three-storey house for three years. The Acharya family hails from Diktel Rupakot Majhuwagadhi Municipality in Khotang district. The deceased, Kul Prasad Acharya, was acting head of the Khotang District Post Office. Elder son Milan had been preparing for public service exams, while younger son Prabin was pursuing a BSc degree. \nThe Nepal government has renewed its travel advisory for citizens planning to visit Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, and Laos, highlighting increasing risks of human trafficking and fraudulent recruitment schemes.The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MoFA), in an advisory issued on Monday, warned citizens to exercise caution and avoid falling victim to false promises of lucrative overseas employment. This advisory follows recent incidents involving Nepalis trafficked to Southeast Asian countries, particularly Myanmar’s Kayin province, where they were forced into illegal activities under harsh conditions.In the meantime, in a press release issued on Tuesday, the Embassy of Nepal in Bangkok reported the rescue of five Nepali citizens from Myanmar’s Mawadi. Four men were repatriated on December 17 with assistance from government and international organisations, while the fifth individual, a woman, returned to Nepal on December 24 [Tuesday].Earlier, in an advisory issued on Monday, the government detailed cases of the severe mistreatment victims endure, including confiscation of passports, excessive working hours, unpaid wages, and even physical abuse. It noted that criminal networks have expanded operations to Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar, targeting Nepalis with fraudulent job offers.The ministry also underscored the use of social media platforms by traffickers to promote fake employment opportunities. Citizens have been advised not to travel on visit visas for work purposes and to verify job offers through embassies or official channels. \n\nThe issue of banning helicopter sightseeing tours in one of the world’s most iconic natural regions, home to the planet’s tallest mountain, from January 1, has turned nasty.As state bodies at all levels, including the local government, are staking their unflinching claim to the skies over the Everest region, serious questions have been raised about Nepal’s high-end tourism prospects. Experts say such a jurisdiction issue may spill over to other national parks if this issue is not handled well. The federal government, however, has not taken the matter seriously.On December 12, the Sagarmatha National Park, which houses the world’s tallest peak, issued directives restricting commercial choppers from flying over it. On December 13, the civil aviation regulator responded that the park has no legal ground to enforce such a ban.After three days, on Monday, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, the local federal unit, issued a strongly worded statement against commercial chopper operations in the Everest region.“We request the Trekking Agencies Association of Nepal and all travel agencies operating within this rural municipality to refrain from booking or selling any packages that include helicopter flights for the Khumbu region,” according to the statement. “If any individual or agency engages in such activities after this notice, and if it causes any obstacles or issues in this region, the rural municipality will not be held accountable. This press release has been issued to inform all concerned parties.”The municipality added: “Beyond Lukla, only rescue and sling flights that comply with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be allowed. All other commercial helicopter flights will be banned entirely from January 1.”As per the rural municipality directive, a recommendation must be obtained from the health institution at the flight site for emergency rescues. A health professional must be present on the flight. If further treatment outside the region is required, patients must undergo a test at Pasanglhamu Nicole Niquille Hospital in Lukla and get a mandatory recommendation from the hospital. “Henceforth, only rescue and sling flights in compliance with the laws and regulations of Sagarmatha National Park will be permitted beyond Lukla,” the municipal statement reads.The statement comes in response to one by the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, which vowed not to follow the rules imposed by the national park and asked the helicopter companies to continue with their regular flights. The immediate concern raised by the park is severe noise pollution caused by frequent helicopter flights over the area. The noise disturbs animals, which rely on the park’s relatively undisturbed natural environment. Excess noise can interfere with their feeding, breeding, and other behaviours.The national park has tasked the Nepal Army and local youth groups with monitoring the ban, a development chopper operators see as a serious security concern.“The noise generated by choppers is alarming,” said Jagat Prasad Bhusal, chief administrative officer of the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality. “Every day, it feels like the loud noise will blow your ears out.”On November 13, the rural municipality held a discussion inviting ten lawmakers from the upper house of parliament in the Khumbu region. The programme had to be abandoned due to excessive noise of choppers. “Most complaints are from schools. The noise has affected the studies of children.”Every day, the rural municipality receives hordes of complaints from locals about noise pollution. “We do not oppose flights, but the helicopter companies are adamant about not obeying rules. They land anywhere they wish,” said Bhusal. According to the rural municipality, most helicopters are yet to pay the Rs200,000 annual “business tax” imposed by the local government. The park, which covers an area of 1,148 square kilometres in the Solukhumbu district, was established on July 19, 1976. In 1979, in recognition of its superlative natural surroundings and unique culture, it was put on the UNESCO World Heritage Sites list.The national park said noise pollution in the wildlife habitat has resulted in behavioural changes in animals.The sounds can cause wild animals to leave their habitats and run into the villages. The park authority said accidents involving animals like Himalayan tahr and Himalayan goral, a goat-antelope with a short tail and backwards-pointing horns, are rising. The shy natural goral is found foraging and sheltering on rocky faces of mountains.The animals jump off the cliffs in shock when choppers fly at low altitudes with big sounds. Their deaths are rising. The park authority said they had done justice to the wild animals by stopping commercial flights above the national park.Tourism ministry officials said they are aware of the issue. “We have been discussing the matter with the forest ministry,” said Ram Krishna Lamichhane, spokesperson for the tourism ministry. “We hope the issue will be sorted out soon.”The tourism fraternity warned that the Everest sightseeing ban could harm Nepal’s tourism, which is still struggling to recover to pre-Covid levels. The park is also a major tourist attraction, especially for trekking to the Everest base camp.The Everest sightseeing tour, which falls into an expensive, high-end tourism segment, is a lifelong dream of many people around the world. \nSamara endured six months of harassment from a relative of her late husband before a court interim order demanded her harasser leave her alone. In this period of inaction from the court, Samara (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) fell into depression and attempted suicide, feeling trapped and hopeless. “There is late justice, and these victims are still being victimised,” Samara’s legal counsel told the Post. “Justice delayed is justice denied.” Women in Nepal seeking justice for domestic violence or property partition wait years—often more than five and sometimes upwards of ten years—for the court to resolve their cases and fully implement the decision. The delays in case processing come at a cost to the women, who endure more harassment, financial strain, and loss of contact with their children as they wait for the justice system to take action. In the past year, the court has established a family bench in six of the 77 district courts in Nepal to hear women’s cases more quickly. The bench aims to give female plaintiffs faster decisions in cases related to family relations, alimony, domestic violence, and property division. The family bench, however, does not see a woman’s case when it also includes a legal matter outside of the purview of the bench, nor does the court see divorce cases as Nepali law mandates a one-year waiting period for divorce cases when one of the parties does not agree to the divorce. Since its filing, the main trial court has heard Samara’s case as it is tied to a property division case in which her late husband’s relative is the plaintiff. Samara’s interim order from the court has brought her some peace. Since the order two years ago, her harasser has stopped coming to her workplace demanding the property holdings of her late husband. “After she got the interim order, she believed in herself more,” Samara’s legal counsel said. “Before, she didn’t believe in court, she thought she would not get justice.” Samara’s legal counsel anticipates that the case will take at least another two and a half years at the district court, and may continue longer at the Supreme Court level if one of the parties chooses to appeal the decision. “She doesn’t feel protected,” the legal counsel said. Even when a woman’s case goes to the family bench, procedural hurdles can still delay the verdict, particularly when the case involves property division. Edha’s (who the Post is also identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) domestic violence and property division case is in its fourth year at the Kathmandu District Court. One of her hearings was with one of the three judges appointed to preside over the family bench. She had an arranged marriage more than 20 years ago, and soon after she gave birth to her first child. “After I got married, the abuse was non-stop,” she said. “It was quite brutal.”During her marriage, her husband, who continuously had relationships with other women, left her with serious injuries in bouts of violence, and pressured her to abort multiple pregnancies, though she did later have a second child as the pregnancy was too advanced to abort. Edha didn’t tell anyone about the abuse for most of her marriage. “If you’re going through something bad, if nobody comes to know, then it’s okay,” she said. “My fear was, if people find out, what will they think?”This fear of judgment stopped Edha from taking legal action for years. “In Nepal, if your husband hits you, that means it’s your fault,” she said. “With that kind of stigma, at times, I would just blame myself.” During the pandemic, Edha’s husband told her he wanted a divorce, and became more physically abusive. She decided to leave the house and move to a different home, though she felt hesitant about having to leave her children. “When he told me to get out of the house, and when he started hitting me, I thought I cannot survive in the house,” she said. “It was really difficult for me to leave. I feared I wouldn’t be able to take care of my children.”Edha hopes she will soon have her final hearing, which has been delayed because the court required further documentation. Edha fears seeing her abuser again at the hearing. “That fear is still within me,” she said. “I don’t want to look at that man.”After years of living alone, Edha feels most devastated by the loss of time with her children. She hopes her case will result in her being able to stay where she currently lives and have parental visitation rights. “They told me, within three months, this will be over,” she said between tears. “But it’s the fourth year running, and my kids are far away. I have missed the moments with them.” Edha feels stuck, with no other option than waiting for justice. “I don’t have any faith in the justice system of Nepal—no faith at all,” she said. According to domestic violence victims and their lawyers, when a male defendant has connections to judges or enough money to offer bribes, getting justice can be near impossible. Manika Khadka is a criminal lawyer working with the Women’s Foundation Nepal, and has seen dozens of women’s cases. “In some cases, he [the defendant] is so powerful and they use unnecessary power—that’s why we cannot get justice.”Neesa (also a pseudonym) filed a property division case against her husband nearly a decade ago and shortly after a domestic violence case. Male members of her family had for years violently abused her. Her cases have faced continuous delays, she claims, because of her husband’s bribes and connections to court officials. “You can go and register your case in the court, but then if corruption is involved… court procedures can be manipulated to cause delays,” she said. The Supreme Court has already issued a verdict in Neesa’s favor on the domestic violence case, ordering the defendant to pay both interim relief and a fine. The court, however, has failed to implement the decision.According to Neesa, because of bribes from her husband, officials in the implementation division of the district court have intentionally not enforced the Supreme Court’s verdict to make the defendant pay interim relief to the victim. Instead, the implementation division gave an order that would allow the defendant to avoid payment—a direct violation of the Supreme Court’s ruling. Neesa has no choice but to go back through the court system again, asking for the Supreme Court’s decision to be enforced. Her property case is still ongoing, and each step of the process takes months, she said. “There is a delay at every step of the process,” Neesa said. “The court officials don’t do their jobs efficiently.” Neesa feels frustrated with how long her cases have taken, and the amount of time, money and energy they have required from her. “It is a nightmare,” she said. “These delays and obstacles are attempts to make the plaintiff give up—women rarely have the resources to fight these cases for years and years.” “I can’t plan my life, I’m stuck,” she said. “It’s years of my life I won’t get back.” Samara, Edha, and Neesa each are equipped with legal counsel and have current cases pending, but, as Neesa reflected, innumerable women endure abuse in silence, particularly after they see other women endure long delays in the court cases. “I am educated and can stand up for myself and this is how I am treated, imagine the women who are uneducated,” Neesa said. “If [the court procedure] was simple and it was fair a lot more women would go through it and get justice,” she said.   \nSeven years and seven months after inking the Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), Nepal and China on Wednesday signed a framework for BRI cooperation during Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s China visit, which ends on Thursday.Acting Foreign Secretary Amrit Bahadur Rai and deputy head of China’s National Development and Reform Commission Liu Sushe signed the framework cooperation on behalf of the respective countries. The commission is the focal agency in China, tasked with the development of BRI projects.The framework will be valid for three years and will get another three-year extension unless terminated by either side.Speaking briefly from Beijing with the Post, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba said that the framework signed on Wednesday is not new. “It should be understood as a continuation of the memorandum of understanding signed in 2017,” she added.A joint task force of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the two largest parties and ruling partners, in Kathmandu had tweaked the original BRI implementation plan proposed by the Chinese side in 2020.Wednesday’s development formally endorses Nepal’s involvement in the BRI, a programme China proposed and Nepal initially signed in 2017. But negotiations on the projects under the BRI could still prove difficult in the future.‘Aid financing modalities’, as have been agreed under the new framework, have elements of both grant and loan, said one Nepali official who is a part of Oli’s delegation in Beijing.“Even as we signed the framework, we were clear that we cannot accept projects under the BRI with interest rates exceeding those charged by bilateral and multilateral donors,” the official said. “Our focus would be on seeking grants and concessional loans in line with the interest rates offered by the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and other bilateral and multilateral agencies.”Wednesday’s agreement paves the way for negotiations on the ten projects that Nepal had proposed to China.“Today, we signed the Framework for Belt and Road Cooperation,” Prime Minister Oli wrote in his X account. “I am honoured to reflect on the bilateral talks with Premier Li Qiang, discussions with National People’s Congress of China Chairman Zhao Leji and the highly fruitful meeting with President Xi Jinping.”The economic cooperation between Nepal and China will further strengthen under the Belt and Road Framework Cooperation, writes Oli.Just ahead of the prime minister’s departure for Beijing on Monday, the Nepali side had sent a new version of the framework for BRI cooperation and insisted on grants as the project financing model. But the Chinese side objected to the words and replaced them with ‘assistance financing’ and sent the document back to the Nepali side for consideration.“Then we sat again, spoke with the prime minister and proposed a middle path using the phrase ‘aid financing’ as a modality,” one Nepali member of the delegation told the Post from Beijing over the phone. “The Chinese took some time to consider our proposal. Therefore, the new BRI framework is missing in the joint communiqué released late Tuesday. Eventually, both parties agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’ and the agreement was signed on Wednesday.” On Nepal’s side, the negotiations were led by Prime Minister Oli’s economic and development adviser Yubaraj Khatiwada, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba and Acting Foreign Secretary Rai. High-ranking foreign ministry officials represented the Chinese delegation.As Nepal and China are in different stages of development, projects will be selected on the basis of Nepal’s specific requirements and needs. During project negotiation, the final BRI framework agreement states, both sides should uphold the principle of technical, financial, commercial and economic viability and value for money. Likewise, both sides will work to create a conducive business environment.The ‘Objective’ of the BRI framework cooperation states that both sides should facilitate the financial and technical cooperation for each project, and they identified the areas of cooperation—economic development, financial sector cooperation, transport, connectivity and logistic cooperation, trade industrial capacity and investment cooperation, and customs clearance—according to another member of the Nepali delegation who is in Beijing.Nepal has proposed ten different projects to be executed under the BRI. They are Tokha-Chhahare tunnel road, Hilsa-Simikot road project, Kimathanka-Khandbari road and bridge, Jilong-Kerung-Kathmandu cross-border railway, Amargadhi City Hall in Dadeldhura, Jilong-Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220KV transmission line, Madan Bhandari University, Kathmandu Scientific Centre and Science Museum, China-Nepal friendship industrial park in Damak and Jhapa sports and athletic complex.Nepal will set priorities and prepare the implementation plan for each of these projects. The Nepali side, in the negotiation phase, had changed several proposals.The Nepali side significantly shortened the list of priority areas originally proposed by the Chinese side in early 2020 which included construction of the Trans-Himalayan Multi Dimensional Connectivity Network, including ports, roads, bridges, tunnels, highways, railways, aviation infrastructure, telecom projects, electricity transmission line, carrying out the China-Nepal cross-border railway project.Similarly, the two sides will develop implementation plans for energy related projects, cooperation in the field of e-commerce and trade and industrial capacity enhancement, building trade infrastructures, adopting trade and investment liberalisation, and expanding bilateral economic relationship.The BRI framework provides significant impetus for a stronger economic and project development partnership between the two countries, said Semanta Dahal, who was part of the task force that revised the BRI framework on behalf of the ruling coalition in a capacity of legal adviser. He added that it addresses ambiguities surrounding the infrastructure projects to be implemented under the BRI in Nepal and establishes clear negotiation principles, including the use of aid financing.“This will facilitate negotiations on a project-by-project basis and ensure that infrastructure and connectivity projects offer value for money,” he said. \n\n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nWhen I visited ‘The Mini Prints Art Fair’, hosted by Siddhartha Art Gallery, I observed a vibrant celebration of contemporary Nepali art showcasing talented artists. The exhibition features 200 intricate mini-prints using etching, woodcut, and embossing techniques.The fair offers diverse artistic interpretations with works ranging from creations such as ‘Unstable II’ by Sujita Maharjan to cultural depictions like ‘Ganapati Bappa’ by Seema Sharma Shah. Delicately crafted pieces encapsulate themes of tradition, identity, and imagination. This fair not only highlights the technical expertise of Nepali artists but also the evolving narrative of contemporary art in the region. Rustom Mody, country director of the British Council Nepal, inaugurated the event, emphasising the fair’s cultural significance. Visitors will have an immersive experience of vibrant stories told through a small-scale yet impactful medium.The exhibition, organised by Printmaking Nepal, highlights the organisation’s dedication to nurturing the art of printmaking among the younger generation. Focusing on education and creativity, the studio conducts workshops to equip aspiring artists with the skills and confidence to pursue their passions. Over the years, they have collaborated with 100 artists, blending the talents of emerging graduates and seasoned professionals. Their primary aim is to foster collaboration between new and established artists, creating a learning environment based on mentorship and experience-sharing.Uma Shankar Shah, one of the founding members of Printmaking Nepal, wants to make print art more accessible by highlighting its affordability. With prices starting from Rs3,000, Shah hopes audiences will embrace Printmaking Nepal’s message: “Art can be affordable and accessible, allowing common people to own and enjoy it without spending a fortune.”He discussed his artwork titled ‘Ramayan’, inspired by his roots in Janakpur. Having previously worked on series like ‘Roti-Beti’, he continues exploring the Maithili storytelling style, which he notes is rarely represented in art. Shah incorporates iconic imagery in his print art ‘Ramayan’, such as the main gate doors, the bow, and Sita Swayamvar. Visitors will notice a deliberate contrast in the artwork’s use of colour, with one piece being colourful and another monochrome. This distinction is achieved using natural elements, including soil, to bring depth and authenticity to the pieces. He says, “Artists face several challenges in pursuing their craft, with the lack of studio space being a primary concern. Thankfully, there are now at least ten studios in Kathmandu where they can work. Another major difficulty is sourcing materials, such as zinc plates and 20x40-inch paper, which are essential for their work. The process is also physically demanding, using acid for etching and handling heavy stones weighing 15-20 kilograms. These stones must be moved repeatedly across tables, requiring careful precision to avoid accidents, which could result in significant setbacks.”As he walked me through the exhibition, it was evident that it did not follow a central theme. He explained, “All the artists centred their work around a basic question: what can society gain from this? In this exhibition, we focus on the post-postmodernism of the 21st century—not rejecting tradition like postmodernism but delving deeper into cultural roots. As we observe in contemporary society, individuals are increasingly drawn to ancient works, whether through traditional designs in clothing or music. Our focus is on representing societal traditions in a new way.”When asked what message he had for emerging artists, he said, “As both an artist and organiser, my advice to them is that there are studios and opportunities available to showcase the work you create right after graduation. So, don’t give up on pursuing this field. Take inspiration from artists like David Basnet, who, despite being in the middle of his master’s degree, already has his artwork featured in this exhibition. Opportunities like these prove that talent and dedication can open doors, even early in your career.”Sujita Maharjan’s series of prints greets visitors, exploring themes of architectural evolution. One of her works critiques the tension between the instability of modern building designs and the rising costs of preserving traditional aesthetics. Another striking piece features a boat with a building. Her print art also incorporates intricate patterns that draw connections to Buddhism, adding a spiritual dimension to her exploration of architecture and culture.Another artist, Lokchitra, one of Nepal’s well-known traditional ‘paubha’ or ‘thangka’ artists, brings his expertise into printmaking with his work ‘Panchabuddha’. He explained, “This work reflects self-realisation, illustrating the five elements present in our bodies: air, water, fire, earth, and aether. ‘Panchabuddha’ essentially represents us, not external forms of Buddha.” In another piece titled ‘Atala’—meaning ‘unmovable’—he depicts a falchion with two blades, symbolising cutting through ignorance by understanding relative and ultimate truths. His art beautifully merges traditional symbolism with contemporary printmaking techniques.Similarly, David Basnet’s contributions include the print ‘Blooms of Thanksgiving’, inspired by the Christmas season, his gardener father, and his love for plants. The blooming cactus featured in his artwork reflects these personal connections. He explained, “Another piece, ‘Through the Bamboos’, was inspired by Nepal’s recent floods. After learning that bamboo helps prevent soil erosion, I created this artwork to highlight its environmental significance.”Basnet’s third work, ‘Old Cycle’, evokes nostalgia for his childhood memories of cycling in Kathmandu. Another of his prints depicts clock hands obstructed by vines but surrounded by blooming flowers. “Even during moments of obstruction, beauty can still emerge,” Basnet shared.Umesh Shah, primarily a painter, shared that he found printmaking interesting through the workshop. His work mainly incorporates Mithila elements inspired by Bastar Art and folk art. His piece ‘Plantation’ reflects his experience living in the Tarai region, contrasting past greenery with current deforestation. Through this, Shah urges for reforestation and better land utilisation. Another of his prints portrays the dedication and hard work of labourers, despite their insufficient wages, using tribal imagery to emphasise their resilience and struggle.Each artist brings a unique perspective, blending personal stories, cultural heritage, and social commentary._____The Mini Prints Art FairWhen: Until January 15Where: Siddhartha Art Gallery, Babermahal RevisitedTime: Sunday to Friday: 11:00 am to 5:00 pm, Saturday: 12 noon to 5 pmEntry: Free \nForeign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba returned from New Delhi on Monday evening, with no clarity on when Prime Minister KP Oli will make his long anticipated official visit to India. Despite Oli’s eagerness to visit the southern neighbour since taking office in mid-July, efforts to secure an invitation from New Delhi have yet to succeed. At the same time, CPN-UML deputy general secretary and former foreign minister Pradeep Gyawali also returned home from New Delhi on Monday. According to officials, both the incumbent and former foreign ministers failed to make any headway in securing a date for Prime Minister Oli’s India visit.“This time, I went to India to participate in an Indo-Nepal economic summit and for a health check-up,” she said while responding to a question at Kathmandu airport upon her arrival. “I had no political meetings or discussions this time.” Deuba, who left for the Hague, Netherlands on December 7, leading Nepal’s delegation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ), returned home via India where she also underwent a health checkup, according to a statement issued by her private secretariat. On December 9, she had presented Nepal’s position on the ‘Obligations of states in respect of climate change’ during ICJ hearings held from December 2 to 12.The hearings were initiated following the adoption of United Nations General Assembly Resolution A/RES/77/276, which requested the ICJ’s advisory opinion on states’ responsibilities concerning climate change.She then travelled to Berlin, Germany, to attend the Equal Rights Coalition Conference, scheduled on December 17 and 18. The conference was hosted by German Federal Minister for Foreign Affairs Annalena Baerbock on behalf of the Coalition’s co-chairs, Germany and Mexico. During her Europe visit, Minister Deuba held several high-level discussions with officials from Belgium, Luxembourg, Germany, and the European Union.On Monday, before leaving for Kathmandu, she participated in an interaction at India Foundation which is led by Ram Madhav, former general secretary of the Bharatiya Janata Party. Deuba’s Delhi trip came with high expectations, especially after her last visit in August, when she met Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi as well as her counterpart, S. Jaishankar. But this time, the visit was unofficial and she thus could not meet Indian leaders, one official at the foreign ministry said. As she was in Delhi for her regular check up, no formal meetings were planned, according to Deuba’s private secretariat. But according to some Nepali Congress leaders, she tried her best to meet her counterpart, Jaishankar, and other Indian leaders in order to create a positive environment for the prime minister’s India visit, but her attempts were unsuccessful. The prime minister’s office also expected foreign minister Deuba, with her profile and good connections in the Indian establishment, to be able to meet top Indian leaders and lay the ground for the prime minister’s India visit. After the prime minister failed to secure an invitation from India, Oli went on his first bilateral visit to China in December first week and signed a framework for cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative. According to a Nepali Congress leader closely following the dynamics between Oli and New Delhi, India appears uncomfortable with the deal Oli signed in Beijing, adding uncertainty to his Delhi trip. Also, there is unease in the Congress after the party leadership failed to maintain the party position of not taking loans under the BRI framework.While in Delhi, Rana had addressed an Indo-Nepal economic conference, met some policymakers and discussed the future of Nepal-India relations. Despite getting no invitation from India, Oli, speaking in his hometown in the district of Jhapa, had declared that he would visit India soon. “We have achieved good results from my China visit. Some people don’t believe I am going to India. But I am, and unexpected results will be achieved,” Oli had said. \nRabi Lamichhane, president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) that emerged as the fourth largest political force after the November 2022 election, has been officially suspended from the position of lawmaker on Monday. The Federal Parliament Secretariat issued a notice on Monday informing that Lamichhane has been suspended.After the District Government Attorney Office in Kaski on Sunday filed cases against lawmaker Lamichhane and 30 other individuals at the Kaski District Court in connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case, the House suspended his position of lawmaker the next day.Cooperatives fraud, organised crime and money laundering cases have been filed at the district court against Lamichhane, seeking 15 years of imprisonment and recovery of Rs278.9 million.Earlier, the Supreme Court had annulled Lamichhane’s position of lawmaker in January 2023 citing the invalidity of the citizenship certificate he produced to contest the parliamentary election. But later in the same year, Lamichhane won the by-election from Chitwan-2 to reclaim his lawmaker position. He had earlier won election from the same constituency.Before the Parliament Secretariat decided to suspend Lamichhane from his position on Monday, the RSP lawmakers had met Speaker Devraj Ghimire to urge him not to suspend their party president from the position of lawmaker. RSP chief whip Santosh Pariyar, and leaders Sobita Gautam and Ganesh Parajuli met Ghimire in order to draw his attention. After a case was registered against Lamichhane in the Kaski District Court for money laundering, cooperatives fraud and organised crime, the District Police Office Kaski had written to the Secretariat of House of Representatives to suspend the lawmaker position of Lamichhane. However, RSP leaders have been claiming that the lawmaker position cannot be suspended just on the basis of a filed case. “Lawmakers from the RSP had come to meet Speaker Ghimire to urge him not to suspend Lamichhane,” said Ekram Giri, the spokesperson of Parliament Secretariat. “The Speaker told them that he would take the decision as per the law.”According to Clause 27 of the Money Laundering Prevention Act, 2008 (amended), Lamichhane’s lawmaker post would have been automatically suspended. The suspension of Lamichhane as lawmaker has also raised questions about his party’s leadership as he is also the leader of the party's parliamentary party. The law states that if an official or employee of an established organisation or a public servant is in detention, their position will automatically be suspended. However, some legal experts believe that Lamichhane should not have been suspended as ‘public servants’ do not include elected representatives.Advocate Om Prakash Aryal disagrees. “The Prevention of Corruption Act defines a public servant as a person holding a public office under the prevailing law, which also includes elected representatives,” Aryal said. “In addition, the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act also addresses this issue apart from Money Laundering Prevention Act, which justifies labelling elected representatives public servants.” Meanwhile, on Monday, the RSP appointed an acting president for the party’s smooth functioning in the absence of its chair. Based on Article 25 (4) (a) (9) of the party’s statute, Lamichhane on Sunday appointed Dol Prasad (DP) Aryal, the party’s founding vice-president, as the acting president. The decision was taken at a virtual emergency meeting of the party's secretariat on Monday.“Our party has decided to appoint DP Aryal as the acting president of the party,” reads the press statement issued by the party on Monday. “The party also has decided to support the judicial process in the party president’s case.”The RSP has two vice presidents: Aryal and Swarnim Wagle. Section 7 of Article 23 (1) of the RSP statute describes the party vice president’s functions, duties, and powers. According to the statute, in the absence of the party president, the vice president designated by the president or the elder among the two vice presidents will assume the role of the president. As per their citizenship details, Wagle is a few months older than Aryal. Wagle was born on May 29, 1974, while Aryal, the other party vice president, was born on August 22, 1974.The police had arrested Lamichhane from the RSP office on October 18 on charges of misappropriating cooperative savings from at least five different places across the country. Despite the party president being in custody for two months, the RSP had not designated any leader as acting president. However, the party's central committee meeting in November assigned roles related to the RSP’s future strategy to the two vice presidents.Some RSP leaders say the party leadership and the leadership in Parliament must be divided between two vice presidents. “If one vice-chair takes the party’s leadership, the other vice-chair can be the party leader in Parliament,” said an RSP leader, who is also a secretariat member. Earlier, after the Supreme Court annulled Lamichhane’s status as a lawmaker in January 2023, citing the invalidity of the citizenship certificate he produced to contest the parliamentary election, he did not give up the position of party chief. When Aryal was given the role of acting party president, Birajbhakta Shrestha, the deputy leader of the party in Parliament, played the role of party leader until Lamichhane was reelected from the Chitwan-2 by-election. On November 10, during a demonstration in Pokhara, now acting chair of RSP Aryal had said that Lamichhane would remain the President of the RSP for life. Referring to the tussle over the acting presidency in the RSP, he had said, “So long as Rabi Lamichhane is alive, he is the president of the RSP.” He also said who became acting president in Lamichhane’s absence was of secondary concern.  \nThe government has withdrawn a controversial provision from the ‘Bill to amend some Nepal Acts’ that envisioned allowing the withdrawal of criminal cases committed under political cover.The Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on May 10 last year had registered the bill at the Parliament Secretariat to amend Section 116 of the Criminal Procedure Code-2017 so as to clear the hurdles to withdrawing insurgency-era cases of “political nature”.Section 64 of the amendment bill has a provision that says cases sub judice in any court against anyone from a party or a group that conducted violent protests in the past but is carrying out its activities peacefully now, based on the constitution and the law can be withdrawn.In the bill, the government has added a sub-section under section 116 of the code, which ultimately aims at withdrawing the cases from all tiers of courts—Supreme, High and District—against political leaders. Participating in the discussion over the bill in the Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the House of Representatives on Sunday, Law Minister Ajay Kumar Chaurasiya said that Section 64 of the bill had been drawn.“It has to be withdrawn as it might lead to impunity,” said the minister, adding that the decision was made with consent from Dhanraj Gurung, who in the capacity of law minister had registered the bill.Prior to Chaurasiya, Uday Raj Sapkota, secretary at the ministry, had revealed that the government had decided to withdraw the provision.The government holds the authority to produce the bill. It can also withdraw any bill or a part with consent from Parliament. Though a majority of lawmakers welcomed the government’s move, those from the CPN (Maoist Centre) objected to it. Claiming that the provision was introduced to implement past agreements with political forces such as those led by CK Raut and Netra Bikram Chand. Maoist lawmakers have threatened to register notes of dissent if the provision is withdrawn. “The government, in the past, signed deals with different political forces agreeing to withdraw the charges against them. It is the government's responsibility to abide by the agreements,” said Ram Kumar Rai, a Maoist Centre lawmaker.“In fact, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli, who also leads the government now, had forged the agreement. Instead of implementing it, the government is withdrawing the provision.”The preparations by the Dahal government to amend the Criminal Procedure Code had landed into controversy for suspicions that it was aimed at withdrawing the insurgency-era cases of atrocities.Even the National Human Rights Commission, organising a press meet, had objected to the move saying it was deeply concerned about the amendment bill. It argued there was a high possibility that the amendment would lead to the withdrawal of conflict-era charges of human rights violations by giving them political colour.The commission also sought the government’s clarification on the matter though the Dahal administration didn’t respond to it. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission has received 63,718 complaints. Separately, 3,223 cases were lodged with the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission. However, the disappearance commission is investigating only 2,484 cases saying that others do not fall under its jurisdiction.There are also several cases under consideration in various courts against Maoist Centre leaders and security personnel in connection with the crimes committed during the decade-long insurgency. If the bill got through Parliament, it would give a legitimate way for the government to arbitrarily withdraw the cases.After months-long gap, the House committee has resumed deliberation over the bill that has been under consideration for one-and-a-half years. As the government prepares to call the winter session of federal parliament in January, the Speaker, along with the government, wants the House committees to forward the bills, with them, to the plenary.Sixteen bills are under consideration in various parliamentary committees, also called mini parliaments. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has announced that it will start random on-the-spot emission testing of vehicles on the road beginning next week.The move of the city office comes amid deteriorating air quality in Kathmandu Valley.“We have provided necessary training to two mechanical engineers, who will be deployed for emission testing,” said Jagatman Shrestha, traffic expert adviser at the metropolis. “We have also coordinated with the environment department of the federal government, traffic police, and the department of transport management to start these tests.”The city office has purchased two smoke meters (a portable device for testing vehicle emissions)—one for diesel vehicles and the other for petrol vehicles—to carry out emission testing. Officials say, for the first time, motorcycles and scooters will also be tested.Though vehicle emission testing is mainly the responsibility of federal government agencies, the constitution also mandates local governments to take measures to reduce pollution, officials say.The metropolis has developed pollution control guidelines as per the KMC Environment and Natural Resources Protection Act-2021.Officials say these random tests will be conducted on vehicles that have passed emission testing from the department of transport management and received green stickers, as all four-wheelers on the road typically do. However, some may still emit black smoke for various reasons, including lack of timely servicing and maintenance.Many automobile owners only service their vehicles ahead of the annual pollution testing. “We will not issue green stickers to vehicles but check emission levels,” said Shrestha. “If we find vehicles emitting pollutants more than permissible levels, we will slap a fine.”According to the officials, Rs1,000 will be fined for polluting vehicles for the first time.Random vehicle testing is among the measures the city office is taking to tackle air pollution.The municipal environment department has also started monitoring the city’s air quality independently. For that, the city office has installed portable devices in various locations. “We have already installed portable air quality monitoring devices in 16 locations within the metropolis and are preparing to install three more,” said Sarita Rai, chief of the department. “We have also launched a drive to make people aware of air pollution.”Nepal’s air quality reaches hazardous levels several times a year, and the capital city often becomes the world’s most polluted metropolis.According to IQ AirVisual, a Swiss group that collects air quality data from around the world, Kathmandu’s PM2.5 levels reached 197 micrograms per cubic metre (μg/m3) on Friday afternoon.PM2.5 refers to particulate matter (solid or liquid droplets) in the air that is less than 2.5 micrometres in diameter. It is among the most dangerous pollutants that can get past the nose and throat to penetrate the lungs and get into the bloodstream. PM2.5 particles are small and likely to stay suspended in the air for long, increasing the chances of people inhaling them.As per the Environmental Protection Agency’s air quality index, when air quality reaches 151-200, it is considered unhealthy; everyone may experience problems, with sensitive groups feeling more severe effects.Major hospitals report a spike in respiratory problems due to the impact of toxic air and dust. Meanwhile, the city office said it had installed push-button traffic lights in 36 locations for the ease of pedestrians. “We are working to bring those devices into operation soon,” said Shrestha, traffic adviser of the metropolis. “Pedestrians can push the button to stop traffic and cross the road safely.”Push-button devices are installed at traffic intersections to allow pedestrians to request stop road traffic, so that they can cross the road without fear. \nNepali Congress candidate Krishnaman Dangol has been elected mayor of Kirtipur Municipality in the by-election held on Sunday. Dangol secured 5,334 votes, defeating his closest rival, Shivsharan Maharjan of the Maoist Centre, by 779 votes.Maharjan received 4,555 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML garnered 4,337 votes.The by-election was held following the demise of former mayor Rajkumar Nakarmi, who passed away on July 26 last year due to a kidney-related illness. Nakarmi, also from the Congress, was elected Mayor in the 2022 local elections.Kirtipur, historically known as a left-leaning stronghold, saw a shift in political dynamics with Nakarmi’s victory in 2022. Kirtipur was declared a municipality in 1997. \nKrishnaman Dangol of the Nepali Congress has maintained a lead in the ongoing vote count for the mayor of Kirtipur Municipality. As of the latest tally, Dangol has garnered 789 votes, while Surendra Manandhar of the CPN-UML trails with 666 votes. Shivsharan Maharjan of the CPN (Maoist Centre) has received 465 votes. Among independent candidates, Rajman Maharjan has secured 418 votes, Dinesh Kumar Adhikari 236, and Kabikumar Maharjan 58. Rastriya Prajatantra Party’s Dhruba Maharjan has obtained 119 votes, while Bhanu Rijal of the CPN (Unified Socialist) has 22 votes.   \nLinking the excitement of cricket via Nepal Premiere League (NPL) to the classrooms, Ncell Foundation, as per its commitment, will be providing educational kits to 2,612 students from community schools across Nepal. This impactful initiative of the Ncell Foundation to support the students at community schools is tied to the 653 boundaries hit during the entire season of NPL that concluded on Saturday. “This is a testament to the Foundation's commitment to transforming the excitement of cricket into meaningful educational support for underserved communities wherein the Foundation has committed to allocating four educational kits for every 4s hit during the NPL,” Ncell said in a statement. Each kit to be provided to students will include essential items such as school bags, notebooks, pencils, sharpeners, erasers, and more. “This season’s NPL has been a milestone in nurturing Nepali cricketing talents. We are thrilled to collaborate with NPL, combining the passion for cricket with a cause that provides essential educational resources to needy students. We are committed to working with CAN, all regional teams and other stakeholders to ensure the successful attainment of 2,612 educational kits distribution,” said Bishakha Laxmi Khadka, Head of Corporate Communication and CSR at Ncell. \nNupu Sherpa of Tokpegola, situated around 4,100 meters above sea level in Mikwakhola Rural Municipality in Taplejung, sold 20 yaks in Tibet, China, back in 2019. He earned Rs110,000 per head, as there were no border restrictions on taking yaks to the Chinese market. Sherpa and five other herders in Thudam, Sankhuwasabha, a higher pass known as a centre for yak herding, used to sell yaks by crossing the Chinese border. During the pre-Covid period in 2019, the last time they traded yaks to Tibet, they brought Rs5 million each.But since then, they have not been able to export yaks to Tibet.“While trading in Tibet at that time, the 1 Chinese yuan was equivalent to Rs16,” said Sherpa. “I have heard that the rate has increased, but sadly, we cannot sell yaks anymore.”Sherpa currently owns 75 yaks, and all are mature enough to be sold. Normally, yaks have a life expectancy of 15-20 years, and after that, they turn thin and old. So, the commercial value of yak is at the age of 12.“The old yak does not fetch a good price, so selling them while they are still valuable is important,” said Sherpa. Now, to make ends meet, Sherpa has been making dog chews from yak milk. In the upper reaches, when the market in Tibet was open and vibrant, yaks were used as pack animals. “But now, rearing yaks has become a burden for many people,” said Sherpa.Nearly 180 households like Sherpa’s have the same problem—no market access.According to the Yak Farmers Federation, Taplejung, each family is rearing between five to 400 yaks.Sherpa, also president of the federation, said that their only alternative is to let yaks die. Yak farmers have requested Netra Prasad Sharma, chief district officer, to raise the issue with the officials on the other side of the border. Accordingly, on December 14, a meeting was held between the key officials of Taplejung and Dinggye County in southwest Tibet. “We have raised the issue, including to allow trade of agricultural products. It was the main agenda from our side at the meeting, but Tibet showed reluctance to resolve the issue faced by Nepalis living at the Nepal-China border point,” said Sharma.During the meeting, the Chinese representative said that Beijing would make the decision regarding livestock trade and that they would make requests to the higher authority.“We are hopeful the issue will be addressed,” said Sharma.The border people tried to export yak, milk, dog chew and ghee on different occasions but were returned, said Sharma.Kimathanka in Sankhuwasabha and 13 other trans-Himalayan trade points along the Nepal-China border were reopened in May after four years of closure.In May, then Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha reached Tibet through the Kimathanka border point, and Vice-chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region Silang Nima jointly opened the traditional trading points amid a function in the Tibetan town of Chentang. They announced the reopening of 14 of the 21 trading points in various districts along Nepal’s mountain range.Chinese authorities closed the border passes in January 2020 to prevent the spread of the coronavirus, which severely disrupted the livelihoods of Nepalis living in remote mountain villages close to Tibet.“We have raised the issue at Nepal’s home ministry,” said Sharma.The locals who lost one of the crucial markets after Covid-19 were hopeful that the reopening of the border in May for people and trade movements would revive the yak trade.The residents in far-flung northern borders believe that the trade restrictions have also affected Tibet. Mingma Diki of Olangchung Gola said her family would buy yak calves from Tibet, rear them in Nepsl and sell them back to Tibet after they matured.“It’s strange that free trade with Tibet has stopped altogether.”Locals suspected that China might have stopped the yak trade due to lumpy skin disease that spread in Nepal in 2023. The first outbreak of lumpy skin disease in Nepal started in June 2020. By 2023, more than 48,000 cattle have died from the disease that has affected all of the country's 77 districts.More than 3,000 livestock were affected by lumpy skin in Taplejung, according to the Livestock Service Office.Tibet, however, has not officially made any statement about stopping yaks from coming from Nepal.“We submitted a special proposal on this issue, but Beijing declined it,” said Chheten Sherpa Lama, ward chairman of Phaktalung rural municipality, who was in the Nepali delegation with chief district officer Sharma, to Tibet as a translator.The population of yak has been increasing and causing additional burden to farmers, said Lama.“Feeding yaks is becoming increasingly difficult, and fodder shortages are adding to our hardship.”As per the District Livestock Office statistics, there are around 8,000 yaks in Taplejung. The federation said that even if a yak is priced at Rs50,000, Taplejung has yaks worth Rs400 million. Around 60 percent of yaks are at the age to be sold.Locals of the mountain region have been rearing yaks at 3,000 to 5,000 metres as their traditional occupation. They are reared particularly in the higher passes of Sirijunga, Phaktalung, Mikwakhola, Meringden and Phungling.According to the locals, yaks have also become prey to snow leopards, bears and wolves. \nThe Cabinet has given a green signal for the tourism ministry to register the long-pending civil aviation bills in the upcoming winter session of Parliament.Two bills—Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal Bill and the Air Service Authority of Nepal Bill—propose splitting Nepal’s aviation body into two entities—service provider and regulator—a condition for Nepal to be struck off the European Commission’s air safety list.The bills passed by the cabinet on Friday were posted on the website of the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology on Monday.The then Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government had put the bills into hibernation.On September 6, after being halted by the Dahal administration for over a year, the draft civil aviation bills made into the KP Sharma Oli Cabinet’s agenda. Since 2007, successive governments have proposed plans to end the regulator’s dual role. However, the bills have been languishing in obscurity, although they are vital to ensuring safe aviation in Nepal.Passing the civil aviation bills would establish an independent regulator and remove Nepal from the European Commission’s air safety list, which has caused immense damage to Nepal’s tourism and put a spotlight on the country’s terrible aviation safety record. In December 2013, the European Commission banned all Nepali airlines from flying into the 28-nation bloc.Tourism Minister Badri Prasad Pandey tabled the bills at the Cabinet on September 6 after the law and finance ministries approved their drafts.When a bill is presented, the Cabinet approves the draft legislation and its introduction to Parliament.Nepal has a terrible aviation safety record—eight crashes—six fatal ones—taking place over the past two and a half years, killing over 100 people.Lawmakers have raised concerns about the government’s delay in implementing the new law, which aims to establish an independent civil aviation regulator.Tourism ministry officials say this is the fourth time they have sent the bills to the Cabinet since they were passed by the upper house in 2021. But every time, the government changes, and the bills return.On July 16, 2023, two months before the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA), the European authority for aviation safety, planned a safety audit of Nepal’s aviation system, the tourism ministry sent the draft bills to the Cabinet, seeking its ‘approval in principle’ to table them in Parliament.On August 2, 2021, the upper house unanimously passed the two aviation bills, which had been languishing for a year and a half as political squabbling engulfed the country. They were registered on February 23, 2020.In 2022, in its final audit report, the United Nations aviation watchdog ICAO formally asked Nepal to split the civil aviation body into two entities.Several aviation watchdogs, experts, and diplomatic agencies have urged Nepal to strengthen its independent regulatory body to ensure safer skies.The government first announced the proposal in its Three Year Interim Plan (2007-08 to 2009-10), which stated, “In the context of the completion of the study on the institutional strengthening of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal (CAAN), which has been working as the service provider in civil aviation, airport operator and regulator; implementation of doable recommendations suggested by the report is being considered.”Since then, every periodic plan and policy, including the annual budget, has prioritised separating the civil aviation body. But the plan has yet to be implemented. \nThe scan and pay system for Nepali travellers in India planned for this December will likely be delayed due to a commission issue, according to an operator privy to this matter.“In India, no charges are levied when paying through the quick response (QR) code. But when Nepalis start paying via QR code in India, a certain commission should be paid to Nepali banks for this service,” one payment operator said, wishing not to be named.“Now, who will pay the commission as merchants provide the service without charges?”There is no regulation regarding commissions or charges to be paid to Nepali banks on every transaction.In Nepal, when Indian travellers pay through the QR code, minimal standard charges of 1.95 percent are applied to merchants per transaction upon receiving payment via UPI-enabled payment apps. Consumers or merchants are not charged for payments from UPI-linked bank accounts. The UPI, or Unified Payments Interface, is an instant real-time payment system developed by the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) to facilitate inter-bank transactions through mobile phones.In India, when a wallet user makes a payment, the merchant acquirer pays the interchange fee to the wallet issuer. Whether the acquirer will pass this fee to the merchant has not been determined. The interchange fee of up to 1.1 percent applies only on transactions above IRs2,000 to online merchants and large retailers. Furthermore, interchange fees do not apply to peer-to-peer (P2P) payments and small businesses in the P2PM category.India has mandated a zero-charge framework for UPI transactions from January 1, 2020. This means that UPI charges are nil for users and merchants alike.This issue in Nepal has delayed the activation of QR codes for Nepali travellers in India. This is a major hurdle to Nepalis making QR code payments in India, the source added.Operators say multiple discussions have been held regarding the commission issue, including the amount or percentage of the commission to be provided to Nepali banks and who will bear the cost. But there has been no logical conclusion so far.“India’s central bank is also discussing the issue with banks there,” according to the operator.“So it will still take a few months for Nepalis to make QR code payments in India.” Nepal is technically ready to start QR payments in India with approval from Nepal’s central bank. However, unless the Indian side gives a go-ahead, Nepal cannot start the QR payment in India.Nepal even has already conducted a successful trial transaction in India.In September, Nabil Bank trialled transactions through its mobile banking app in Mumbai, India, and achieved a successful result.The Reserve Bank of India needs to provide approval for payment system operators, and banks also need to show their readiness to start the service, operators said.On June 1 last year, Nepal and India signed a memorandum of understanding for cross-border digital payment to ease digital transactions for business people, students, and tourists from both countries.Nepal Clearing House Limited (NCHL) and National Payment Corporation of India (NPCI) International Payments Limited signed and exchanged the memorandum of agreement on behalf of their respective organisations in New Delhi, India.The digital remittance under cross-border digital payment service initiated through a government-to-government agreement has also been delayed from the Indian side.NCHL agreed to a cross-border digital remittance service. However, a year after the agreement, the service has yet to start.NCHL has a 10 percent investment from Nepal Rastra Bank and 90 percent from other commercial banks.The central bank handed NCHL the work of establishing and operating a national payment switch and card.In September last year, Fonepay Payment Service Ltd, Nepal’s largest payment network and NPCI International Payments Ltd (NIPL), the international arm of the National Payments Corporation of India, agreed to launch the first QR code-based payment solution between Nepal and India.On March 1, Indians in Nepal were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones.The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes. The QR code system has become a boon for tourists, especially those from India.It has reduced the hassle of carrying cash as the Nepal government has banned all Indian notes above the denomination of 100.Fonepay said that initially it received transactions of Rs2–3 million daily. Now it reaches around Rs7–8 million daily on weekends or during the tourist season and around Rs5 million daily on normal days.Indians making QR code payments in Nepal are gradually growing as many Indians still do not know about the service availability in Nepal, said Fonepay.Nepal Rastra Bank has imposed rules and regulations for banks to set a daily transaction limit of IRs100,000 while making QR code payments in India. \nThe Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide campaign offering the public free screenings for certain non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, and renal function, among others—in the ongoing fiscal year.The move aims to make people aware of the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, which account for around 80 percent of total deaths, officials say.“As per the instruction of the health minister [Pradip Poudel], we are planning to launch a nationwide campaign to screen for certain non-communicable diseases,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “The campaign will be launched in the month of Falgun (February 13 to March 13).”Non-communicable diseases—hypertension, diabetes, renal disease, liver problems, heart problems, and cervical cancer, among others have emerged as major killers in recent years, accounting for around 80 percent of total deaths. According to a 2019 study on the prevalence of non-communicable diseases by the Nepal Health Research Council, 71 percent of total deaths at present were due to non-communicable diseases, and an additional eight percent of deaths were linked to injuries. The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors like tobacco and alcohol consumption, as well as biological risk factors like high blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid levels, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. Officials hope that free screenings for non-communicable diseases will help raise awareness of risk factors and ultimately help lessen the disease burden.“This campaign aims to make people aware of the emerging risk factors caused by our changing lifestyle, food habits, and stress levels, among other things,” said Ghimire. Officials say that health workers will also organise outreach camps in remote areas where people must walk for hours for health screening.“The main purpose of the free screening campaign of non-communicable diseases is to make people aware of the problems,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Mental Health Section at the division. “The burden of non-communicable diseases has been raised alarmingly of late, and people are seeking care only when the problems worsen.”Early diagnosis and precautionary measures can help stop health problems from becoming serious, doctors say.Public health experts say that it is high time to focus on non-communicable diseases, as their burden has raised alarmingly. As most people do not undergo testing unless there is an emergency, doctors say it may be too late when the symptoms surface. They say that many lives could be saved if testing of non-communicable diseases is made free.Along with free testing, authorities must focus on behavioural changes—improvements in eating habits and physical exercises, among other things.“Countries like ours have been facing a double burden—an alarming rise in non-communicable diseases and the emergence of new vector-borne diseases and other communicable diseases,” said Dr Mingmar Gyelgen Sherpa, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Due to excessive use of processed foods, which contain preservatives, people suffer from multiple non-communicable diseases.”Several studies show alarming signs on a number of issues including growing consumption of alcohol, tobacco, salt and junk food, and insufficient intake of vegetables and fruits, which lead to cardiovascular diseases. Doctors say that along with ensuring free screening and treatment, authorities concerned should focus on raising awareness about lifestyle changes and associated risks. \nWith the confirmation of the second mpox case in Nepal, the Ministry of Health and Population has stepped up surveillance measures to prevent a possible outbreak of the deadly viral disease.Nepal reported the latest case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the disease. Nepal confirmed its first case of mpox infection in June last year, when a 60-year-old foreign national had tested positive.“We have increased health screenings of passengers entering the country from abroad, as per the instruction of the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Kanchhi Maya Twanju, a health worker deployed at the health desk set up at the Tribhuvan International Airport. “We have been instructed to send passengers having fever and those showing symptoms of mpox infection directly to hospitals.”Mpox is a rare disease caused by infection with the mpox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries. Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases.Along with stepping up screening of the passengers entering the country via TIA, health authorities have requested dermatologists throughout the country to refer suspected cases for testing.“We have alerted dermatologists about the risk of an outbreak of mpox virus in the country and have requested them to refer suspected cases for testing,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We will take additional measures following consultations with stakeholders, including the World Health Organisation’s Nepal representatives.”Public health experts in Nepal say that screening suspects at health desks at international airports and land crossings is not sufficient to prevent outbreaks since it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms of mpox to appear, and not all cases of infection can be detected at health desks.Monkeypox cases have been reported in neighbouring India, with which Nepal shares a long, porous border. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions, saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.“We didn’t expect that the infected person would come from Saudi Arabia, as there is no outbreak currently,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “This incident shows that the deadly disease may come from any country, and we must remain vigilant and prepare agencies concerned accordingly.”Doctors say preventing an outbreak of the deadly viral disease is not the sole responsibility of a single health agency, and it is impossible to do so.“Every agency and person, including passengers, should shoulder the responsibility and take preventive measures,” Pun stated.Mpox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came to widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease.Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.Meanwhile, health officials informed that the condition of the infected man is normal and he will remain in hospital isolation for an additional two weeks.They said that they are also working to trace close contacts between the patients on the plane and the taxi driver who took him to the hospital. \nNepal reported another monkeypox or mpox case on Friday. A 36-year-old man from Tanahun, who returned from Saudi Arabia on Thursday, tested positive for the deadly disease. “Yes, samples of the suspect, who has been admitted to the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital, have returned positive results,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire. “We collected the samples on Thursday and got a positive report today [Friday].”Health authorities confirmed the first case of monkeypox infection in June last year.A 60-year-old foreign national had then tested positive for the infection.Monkeypox is a rare disease caused by infection with the monkeypox virus and one in 10 infected persons can die. Most common in remote parts of central and west Africa, the disease has now been reported in at least 122 countries . Its symptoms include fever, headache, swelling, body pains, exhaustion, and itchy rashes on the face, hands, and feet.As the disease primarily spreads through close person-to-person contact, public health experts recommend self-isolation and good hygiene to avoid it.According to health officials, the infected person, who is a migrant worker, was sent to the Dhapasi-based Grande International Hospital soon after arrival.Doctors at the hospital suspected monkeypox infection, based on the symptoms, and referred the patient to Sukraraj Hospital.“He had rashes in his private parts and blisters on hands and legs,” said a doctor at the hospital, requesting anonymity as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The patient admitted to have had sexual contact in Saudi Arabia.”Officials at the EDCD said they will start contact tracing from Saturday.“We have to trace close contacts of the patient on the plane he travelled and the vehicle he used to go to hospitals,” said Ghimire. Public health experts say that even if the rare viral infection is usually mild and most people recover within weeks, the risks should not be underestimated. They stress precautions saying that every disease seen in any corner of the world can come to Nepal due to the high mobility of people.Monkeypox has been a globally neglected public health problem in parts of Africa for decades. The disease came into widespread attention after May 2022, with countries outside Africa reporting new cases.Mpox has since spread globally. More than 100,000 people from 122 countries have already tested positive for the disease. India has recorded at least 30 mpox infections since 2022.Beyond Africa, monkeypox is spreading chiefly in men who have sex with men, putting sexual health clinics on alert for new cases. \nNepal’s health authorities are mulling postponing the malaria elimination target to 2030, aligning with the World Health Organisation’s target, after efforts to contain the spread of the disease proved ineffective and it became impossible to declare the country ‘malaria-free’ by the 2026 deadline.What alarmed them most was the isolated indigenous cases that have emerged as a major challenge to eliminating the disease from the country even by 2030.“Isolated indigenous cases of malaria have become a major challenge in containing the spread of the deadly disease,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Single indigenous cases of infection have been reported from several places. We have been struggling to trace the source of infection.”Malaria is caused by Plasmodium parasites. Infected female Anopheles mosquitoes carry these deadly parasites, according to the World Health Organisation. Nepal had initially committed to achieving ‘malaria-free’ status by 2026. For this, the country needs to bring down indigenous cases or local transmission to zero, achieve zero deaths starting from 2023, and maintain zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years.However, the country has failed to bring down indigenous cases to zero in both 2023 and 2024.Instead, cases of infections–both Indigenous and imported have risen alarmingly, which shattered any prospects of eliminating the disease within the deadline.Health officials say that only 16 cases of local transmission or indigenous cases were confirmed in 2023. But in 2024, more than 20 cases have been reported. Compared to 649 imported cases in 2023, the country witnessed nearly 1,000 such cases in 2024.Indigenous malaria cases are locally transmitted, meaning the infected person does not have a history of travel to a malaria-affected country. Officials say that the isolated indigenous cases of malaria infection are such cases that they do not have a history of travelling to the disease-endemic areas.“Neither the people of the community and family have been infected, nor the infected persons have a history of travelling to disease-hit areas,” said Dahal. “We have stepped up surveillance measures to trace the source of infection.”Officials attribute that the disease might remain asymptomatic for a long time in the infected person and emerge as single isolated cases or may have been contracted within the country in areas not considered endemic.Officials further added that open borders, budget cuts in the health sector, and mosquitoes moving to higher altitudes due to climate change have hindered Nepal’s malaria elimination goal.They say that of the total imported cases, over 80 percent came from India. Some cases were imported from African countries. Nepali security personnel serving in UN peacekeeping missions in conflict-hit African countries also often get tested positive for malaria.Officials say the disease is unlikely to be eliminated in Nepal unless India eradicates it first. They say that due to proximity, and an open and porous border between Nepal and India and unregulated travel of people of both countries, it is impossible to eliminate malaria in Nepal, until the disease gets eradicated in the southern neighbour.Several other factors, including cuts in the health budgets by government and aid agencies and shifts in vectors transmitting malaria to the hills and mountains due to global warming, also pose serious challenges to meeting the elimination target. Apart from this, most health facilities across the country lack entomologists necessary for conducting surveillance. Malaria-related deaths had stopped since 2016, but five years later, in 2021, the country recorded one death from the disease.Officials at the health ministry said that until recent years, Plasmodium Vivax, a protozoan parasite, had been responsible for most of the malaria cases in the country, which caused relatively less severe diseases. However, cases of Plasmodium falciparum, which most often cause severe and life-threatening malaria, have been rising. The parasite is common in many countries in Africa and the Sahara desert. \nNepal received 460,940 doses of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine on Tuesday evening, which will be used in the nationwide vaccination drive, scheduled to start on February 5, next year.The vaccine doses are part of over 1.7 million doses required for the first phase of the campaign, health officials say.“We received the first tranche of HPV vaccine doses,” said Om Prasad Upadhyay, an immunisation supervisor officer at the Department of Health Services. “Remaining doses will arrive before the start of the vaccination campaign.”Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact and is a major cause of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is the second-most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women as well. It is estimated that hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer in Nepal every year.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Experts say early treatment can prevent up to 80 percent of cervical cancer cases.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced HPV vaccines nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced them in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccines in Chitwan and Kaski districts. During the pilot, all girls aged between 11 and 13 years were given two doses of the vaccine.Last year, the country purchased 20,000 doses of the HPV vaccine and administered it to around 9,000 girls aged between 14 and 15 years in all seven provinces. Health authorities administered the vaccines at schools after other measures failed to increase the vaccine’s uptake.Doctors say most cases of cervical cancer are linked to HPV, and widespread immunisation could significantly reduce the impact of cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers worldwide.The Ministry of Health and Population is preparing to launch a nationwide HPV vaccination drive from February 5 next year.During the nationwide campaign, over 1.68 million girls between 10 and 14 years will be administered the HPV vaccine. Two doses of vaccine will be administered within a 12-month period. The Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has committed to supply the vaccine doses required for the campaign free of cost along with the campaign’s operation cost, officials say. The government has decided to include the HPV vaccine in the routine immunisation list following the compilation of the nationwide drive.It is estimated that there are around 350,000 girls aged 10 years who will be inoculated with the HPV vaccine.Nepal has to cover a certain percentage of the cost of the vaccine once it is included in the regular immunisation list, officials say.The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) has imposed a fine of Rs200,000 on Bhatbhateni Supermarket in Tripureshwar for selling substandard products. The Department of Agriculture and Livestock, under KMC, found mold in packaged food items during an inspection prompted by customer complaints.Dr Awadhesh Jha, an inspection officer from the department, stated that the KMC call centre received complaints alleging the sale of “expired, rotten, and pest-infested food” at the store. Following the inspection, 44 packets of coconuts were found to contain mold, leading to their destruction on Friday and the subsequent fine imposed on the supermarket.In an official statement, KMC emphasised the importance of adhering to food safety regulations, saying, “The penalty amount must be deposited into the city’s revenue account. Moving forward, ensure that all items sold comply with Nepal’s laws and maintain high-quality standards fit for consumption.” \nNepal Foods has been named Best Nepali Brand of the Year 2024 at the 9th Asian Food and Restaurant Awards International, held at the Royal Ascot. The event recognised excellence in the culinary industry, celebrating cultural diversity and innovation.The awards are known for highlighting outstanding contributions to the UK’s food sector. Nepal Foods’ achievement reflects its commitment to quality and authenticity in Nepalese cuisine.Bikash Nepal, Director of Nepal Foods, expressed pride in receiving the award, stating, “This recognition celebrates our efforts to promote Nepali culture and cuisine globally. It’s a testament to the dedication of our team.”With products available in the USA, Canada, Australia, Europe, and Japan, Nepal Foods continues to showcase Nepali gastronomy on an international stage. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

Out of nowhere, I messaged my friend Santona on a whim: ‘A trip to Rara’. With little hope, I awaited her reply, and I have no idea what I’d have done if she had denied it. However, just like the phrase “waiting for the nudge,” she enthusiastically agreed, and soon we roped in our friend, Nirjara.This wasn’t our first trip together—we’d ventured to Pokhara, tried bungee jumping, paragliding, and trekked trails like Khuma and Korchan since our first year of bachelor studies. My idea this time was a well-packaged tour, but plans changed, and new destinations were chosen. The pristine Tilicho Lake became our goal. Without overthinking, I agreed; after all, it’s Nepal and here, no matter where you decide to trek, you’ll experience heaven.From Kathmandu to Manang: Green Lake and apple delightsTravelling to Manang was a meditative experience in itself. As a scout exploring different parts of Nepal, I had often embraced the rush of adventure. But here, by the serene Green Lake under the sun's warm glow, I felt a genuine sense of accomplishment: ‘We’ve finally made it—without getting lost and in the right place.’ We clicked photos, laughed, and even made some silly TikTok videos. The famous apple farms of Manang called out to us with their irresistible offer: a feast of apples for just Rs200. If you’re travelling here, catching the early bus ensures Manang’s charm unfolds entirely by the end of the day.Khangsar to Tilicho Base Camp: rocks and rantsAn early morning jeep ride brought us to Khangsar. The trek was said to take 5-6 hours, but once we started, I moved ahead of my friends, a habit I don’t quite understand. I wondered if my friends would make it before dark. To my relief, their laughter and chatter soon filled the air, joining me.Then we set off into the landslide area, with jagged rocks above hanging like wind chimes ready to fall. We promised not to look up and remained focused on the trail. The journey was filled with everyday conversations from patriarchy to childhood TV shows, and before we knew it, the night wrapped around us as we arrived at the base camp. After some confusion over our booking, we finally settled in, ate quickly, and fell asleep. One tip: keep an eye on your things at Shrikharka—I lost my trekking poles there.Tilicho Lake: A view, a void, and acceptance Morning arrived. We emptied our room and set out, uncertain if we’d return in time and head straight to Shrikharka or stay the night again at base camp. One friend battled altitude sickness but pushed on fiercely, even bargaining for a horse ride, only to find me eventually outpacing it.As I neared the lake, the solitude and distance overwhelmed me. I called my father, who offered only a few comforting words before the line dropped. Thankfully, friends from home Nuya and Shri reached out, and I poured my thoughts to them through tears. With renewed spirit, I moved forward and finally reached a quiet pond that tricked me into thinking I’d arrived. Only after some guidance did I stand before the actual Tilicho Lake.Strangely, I felt no rush of joy. The sight was majestic, yet my reaction fell flat. I asked myself if it was okay to feel so indifferent. However, I accepted that sometimes it’s okay to feel nothing at all. A simple “I don’t know” was all the answers I needed.We had no rooms left on our last night at base camp, so we slept in a dorm, which was a cheaper and warmer option. After dinner, my friends drifted off, but I lingered by the fire, unwilling to leave its comfort. The dining hall was full of trekkers glued to their seats even after finishing their food until a friendly trek guide offered us seats. These guides, cheerful and chatty, shared fun stories and gossip.Ultimately, I want to say to all who recently went trekking, whether funded by parents or your hard-earned savings, to be proud and grateful for the opportunity to explore. And for those who couldn’t go this time, trust that your moment will come. Keep moving forward with hope, knowing that one day, your adventure awaits. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nJournalists embarked on a five-day tour of Sri Lanka, covering 1,000 kilometers and exploring major religious, cultural, and natural sites, showcasing the country's tourism recovery from economic challenges and the potential for increased tourism between Sri Lanka and Nepal.\nFour popular Nepali destinations highlighted, offering cultural immersion (Mundhum Trek), architectural marvel (Janaki Mandir), scenic beauty with snow (Kuri Village), and wildlife encounters (Bardiya and Khaptad National Parks).\nIn a thrilling U-19 friendly, Nepal drew 1-1 with Bhutan after Sushila KC's opener was canceled by Phuntsho Choden, despite Simran Rai's heroic goal-line clearance in the first half.\nCrucial events unfold as characters navigate challenges, overcome obstacles, and experience transformative moments.\nIsraeli Defense Minister Israel Katz admitted on Monday for the first time publicly to Israel’s killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran in July, further risking tensions between Tehran and its arch-enemy Israel in a region shaken by Israel's war in Gaza and the conflict in Lebanon.“These days, when the Houthi terrorist organisation is firing missiles at Israel, I want to convey a clear message to them at the beginning of my remarks: We have defeated Hamas, we have defeated Hezbollah, we have blinded Iran’s defence systems and damaged the production systems, we have toppled the Assad regime in Syria, we have dealt a severe blow to the axis of evil, and we will also deal a severe blow to the Houthi terrorist organisation in Yemen, which remains the last to stand,” Katz said.Israel will “damage their strategic infrastructure, and we will behead their leaders – just as we did to Haniyeh, Sinwar and Nasrallah in Tehran, Gaza and Lebanon – we will do it in Hodeidah and Sana’a,” Katz said during an evening honouring defence ministry personnel.The Iran-backed group in Yemen has been attacking commercial shipping in the Red Sea for more than a year to try to enforce a naval blockade on Israel, saying they are acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Israel’s year-long war in Gaza.In late July, the political leader of the Palestinian Islamist group Hamas was killed in Tehran in an assassination blamed on Israel by Iranian authorities. There was no direct claim of responsibility by Israel for the killing of Haniyeh at the time.Haniyeh, normally based in Qatar, had been the face of Hamas’ international diplomacy as the war set off by the Hamas-led attack on Israel on October 7 has raged in Gaza. He had been taking part in internationally brokered indirect talks on reaching a ceasefire in the Palestinian enclave.Months after, Israeli forces in Gaza killed Yahya Sinwar, Haniyeh's successor and the mastermind of the October 7, 2023, attack that triggered the latest bloodshed in the decades-old Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \nTrump's transition team plans to withdraw the US from the WHO on his second term's first day, continuing his criticism of the agency and isolating the US from international pandemic efforts.\nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nA few days ago, I attended a programme related to the Institute of Federalism at Madhesh University. During the event held in Rautahat, some participants questioned me about my stance on universities. They noted that when I was a member of Parliament, I opposed the proliferation of universities in Nepal, yet now I support Madhesh University. Their concern was valid, and I welcomed the opportunity to clarify my position.When I served in the National Assembly, I was the only member who voted against establishing new federal universities. My argument has been based on the constitutional framework. The Constitution of Nepal grants provinces the authority to set up and manage provincial universities. With over a dozen universities already under federal jurisdiction, adding federal universities appears unnecessary. Instead, provinces should lead the creation of universities tailored to their specific needs and provide sufficient justification.However, I have consistently emphasised that the federal government’s role should focus on forming a comprehensive higher education policy and an umbrella act for universities. This would create a clear framework for both federal and provincial governments to work together in expanding higher education. Without such a policy and legislative framework, the uncoordinated establishment of universities could strain resources, duplicate efforts and compromise quality. The federal government allocates funds to universities through the University Grants Commission (UGC), and at the provincial level, funding comes via fiscal transfers. However, if the trend of opening new universities continues, having both federal and provincial institutions compete for UGC grants and redirecting funds away from provinces and local governments to the UGC will undermine the purpose of establishing new universities at either the federal or provincial level.Addressing the broader issue of the Ministry of Education’s budget allocation is crucial to understanding where the federal education budget is spent, how much is retained at the federal level, and how much is allocated to provinces and local governments. This in turn helps us examine the UGC’s role in managing these funds at the federal level. Understanding these dynamics is essential for creating a more effective and equitable education system in Nepal.In the fiscal year 2024-25, the Ministry of Education received Rs203.66 billion, with 28.33 percent (Rs57.70 billion) directed to the federal level, 2.26 percent (Rs4.61 billion) to the provinces and 69.41 percent (Rs141.36 billion) to local levels. Analysing the federal allocation of Rs57.70 billion reveals distinct trends. The UGC leads federal education spending, with its share rising from 23.5 percent in FY 2019-20 to 33.21 percent in FY 2024-25. However, most of this funding is used for operational activities rather than research and innovation. School teacher pensions also comprise a significant portion, accounting for 32.93 percent of the federal budget, limiting investments in infrastructure and innovative programmes.The Central Implementation Unit (CIU), with Rs460 million (7.97 percent), manages major education projects, including externally funded initiatives, but there are concerns about its centralised resource management. The Medical Education Commission (MEC) has seen a notable rise in its allocation, from 1.38 percent to 8.96 percent, reflecting a focus on healthcare workforce development. However, the issue of scholarship recipients often leaving Nepal for better opportunities abroad remains challenging.There has been a slight decrease in budget for programmes such as the Higher Education Promotion Programme (HEPP) and the School Sector Development Programme (SSDP), with overlapping roles between HEPP and UGC causing inefficiencies. The SSDP, later replaced by the School Education Sector Plan (SESP), shifted more funding to provincial and local levels, limiting federal involvement to training, administration and curriculum development. Meanwhile, allocations for the President’s Education Reform Programme (1.52 percent) and the Center for Education and Human Resource Development (CEHRD) (1.47 percent) have been criticised for impractical implementation and centralised budgeting.The President’s Education Reform Programme has bypassed the decision-making authority of local governments. The programme often selects school projects at the federal level, with funds allocated to constituencies linked to influential figures. For instance, in FY 2023-24, Education Minister Devendra Poudel directed a large share of the budget to his home district, Baglung, benefiting 143 schools (Kantipur, March 28, 2024). Similarly, in FY 2024-25, the programme prioritised earthquake-affected schools in Jajarkot and Bajhang. Such practices have raised concerns about equitable resource distribution and the programme’s alignment with decentralised governance principles.The Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT), which manages technical and vocational education, received Rs159.59 million (2.77 percent), indicating slow progress in expanding vocational education. Despite increased funding for coordination units like the Education Development and Coordination Unit, the federal budget prioritises pensions, operational activities and centralised programmes over transformative reforms or addressing systemic gaps. These trends suggest the need to reevaluate federal spending to balance decentralisation goals with efficient resource use and equitable education improvements across all levels.At the provincial level, the FY 2024-25 education budget is Rs4.61 billion (2.26 percent of the total Ministry of Education budget), allocated through a conditional grant from the federal government. The CTEVT dominates provincial allocations, receiving 78.4 percent of the total, highlighting a focus on vocational education and technical training, crucial for developing a skilled workforce. Despite its devolved functions, the National Education Board (NEB) receives only 7.3 percent of the provincial budget, suggesting that its activities remain centrally managed, limiting provincial autonomy.In FY 2024-25, 69.41 percent of Nepal’s Ministry of Education budget—Rs141.36 billion—was allocated to local governments as conditional grants. A large portion of the local education budget, 78.21 percent (Rs. 110.60 billion), is directed toward teacher salaries. This allocation supports community schools comprising 85.1 percent of Nepal’s 27,990 schools. Most of this salary budget (68 percent) is spent on basic-level teachers for Grades 1-5, where 67.3 percent of students are enrolled. While prioritising teacher salaries ensures operational continuity, it restricts the local government’s ability to fund other pressing needs. Globally, decentralisation models advocate for more diversified budget allocation to address broader educational challenges effectively.Programmes like day meal initiatives, which help retain students and address malnutrition, receive only 5.99 percent of the budget (Rs8.47 billion). Free textbook grants, including materials in local languages, account for just 2.7 percent (Rs3.81 billion). These essential programmes suffer from limited funding, particularly in underserved communities.Similarly, funding for infrastructure and educational quality is severely inadequate. Only 1.34 percent of the budget goes to school operation and management grants; performance-based incentives for improving educational outcomes account for just 2.17 percent. Less than 2 percent is allocated to school construction, hindering efforts to modernise and enhance learning environments, particularly in rural areas.The rigid structure of budget allocations under the SESP, with over 91 percent of the budget locked into predefined programmes like salaries, meals, and textbooks, limits local governments’ autonomy to create initiatives tailored to their communities’ specific educational needs. In contrast, international best practices grant local authorities greater decision-making power, enabling them to effectively address diverse and evolving educational demands.Minimal investment in alternative education, digital learning and innovative programmes—each receiving less than 2 percent—also emphasises the need to align local budgets with modern educational goals, such as technology integration, bridging access disparities and fostering innovation. \nThere is growing acknowledgment of macroeconomic stabilisation in recent months. Inflation is down, the current account has posted surpluses for four consecutive months on the back of rising remittances, foreign exchange reserves are growing and export growth, while not spectacular, remains consistent. There is some improvement in real economy figures, such as auto sales and cement dispatches, though overall economic growth is still well below par.Beyond big numbers and the debate on whether they deserve cautious praise or considered caution, it’s worth reflecting on what the past few years meant for the average Pakistani household. Between July 2019 and June 2024, inflation came in under 10 percent in fewer than one-third of all months. It reached astronomic highs above 20 percent consistently between July 2022 and January 2024, decimating consumer spending power by at least half. The World Bank estimates an additional six percent of all households—nearly 15 million people—were pushed into poverty during this period.Poverty brings with it a host of other burdens. Caloric deficits become common as spending on meat, fruit and vegetables goes down; children are withdrawn from fee-paying schools, slowing down human capital accumulation; physical well-being is impacted by curbs on health expenses.The actual scale of these burdens is yet to be determined. Since the Labour Force Survey of 2021, the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics has not published any national-level study that can help assess the damage and the extent to which household earnings have lagged inflation. Another usual benchmark, the Pakistan Social and Living Standards Measurement, last came out in 2019.As others have pointed out, the social and political consequences of inflation are already apparent. The PTI’s political upsurge and the mass realignment of voters in urban Punjab, culminating in the 2024 election results, is the most obvious one. The continuing legitimacy crisis on digital media confronting the government and the establishment is another one. Anecdotally, the uptick in legal and illegal migration and disillusionment among white- and blue-collar workers alike are all wreckages from the same crisis. This small window of low inflation should compel a rethink of how the authorities and employers understand the average household’s basic needs.The task at rebuilding an economy that works for the majority and can undo the damage of the past few years is an enormous one. Existing social protection efforts, such as cash transfers through BISP and subsidies at the provincial level, are inadequate. Poorly implemented, randomly assessed and below-par minimum wage regulations consistently come up short as well.This small window of low inflation should compel a rethink of how public authorities and employers understand the average Pakistani household’s basic needs. One alternative proposition is the ‘living wage’ framework, empirically proposed in Pakistan by researchers Kabeer Dawani and Asad Sayeed.The case for a living, rather than minimum wage, is fairly straightforward, existing minimum wage regulations are inadequate and arbitrary and do not cover the actual cost of a decent life for a household in Pakistan. Instead, a new conception is required that can cover a low-cost nutritious diet, basic but acceptable housing and other non-food, non-housing essentials such as clothing, healthcare, transportation and education. Given how the cost of living varies between different locations, the living wage will be different for different regions.In the latest iteration using inflation data from March 2024, Dawani and Sayeed draw up estimates for rural Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and both urban and rural northeast Punjab. The gross living wage comes in at around Rs67,000 for rural KP, Rs45,000 for rural northeast Punjab and Rs51,000 for urban northeast Punjab.The same figures for April 2021 were Rs35,000, Rs16,000 and Rs20,000 respectively. In three years, the benchmark amount required for decent living has nearly doubled or more across different parts of the country.Updating Labour Force Survey data from 2021 to the present, the authors show that in most basic occupations, workers are making considerably less than their estimated living wage. In some cases, such as for unskilled construction workers in Punjab, the difference is as much as Rs25,000 per month.Egregiously, official minimum wage benchmarks also fall considerably short if measured against this benchmark. In other words, even if minimum wage laws were enforced across all sectors, many workers in elementary occupations would still not be making anywhere close to what they actually need. As the authors rightly argue, the only viable short-term solution to reduce the living wage gap is a reallocation of wasteful subsidies from non-poor to poor households in the shape of expanded cash transfers.Alongside short-term interventions, there needs to be a conclusive acknowledgment of the human cost of Pakistan’s repeated boom-bust cycles. In the past few weeks, Khurram Husain’s writings have alerted us to the possibility that in the quest for a quick win, the government may soon shift its focus from stabilisation to growth. As he has rightly cautioned, in the absence of any meaningful change in domestic productivity, the pursuit of growth through easing up of import controls, provision of subsidised credit, or suppression of energy prices may result in the economy heating up again, leading to another bout of high inflation.These cycles do not impact rich, asset-holding households to any great degree. In fact, the rich make money during both booms and busts. When growth is high, there is money to be made from business activities, real estate and the stock market. When growth crashes and inflation goes up, business owners pass on the cost to consumers and those with excess savings switch to debt-based instruments to make use of the higher interest rates. In all instances, it is common households that bear the brunt of a crash and the stabilisation that follows. And if political realities and public anger are anything to go by, the population’s ability to scrape through another bust is at its end.—Dawn (Pakistan) / ANN \nHow Gagan Thapa wishes there were more than 24 hours in a day! He would then be able to meet most of his social obligations. As preparations get underway for the next Nepali Congress general convention, due at the end of 2025, the party general secretary is routinely inundated with meeting requests. Cadres start lining up outside his Ratopul home early in the morning as Thapa, holed up in the kitchen inside, is busy packing tiffin boxes for his two girls. Now 48, the ex-health minister believes the 15th general convention will be a make or break event for him. He has seen some erosion in his fame following the entry of new forces in Nepali politics. The best way to stem this slide would be to win the party presidency and go into the next general elections as the party’s prime ministerial face.Given the fast pace of change in national politics, he might not get another shot at leading the party—or the country as prime minister. This is why he is keen on mending ties with current President Sher Bahadur Deuba. As things stand, the incumbent president could have the final say in the pick of his successor. “I believe there is an undeclared understanding between the two: Deuba will next lead the government, and Gagan will look after party affairs,” says a trusted adviser of Thapa. In this telling, Deuba realises the futility of pushing his wife, Arzu Rana Deuba, up the party hierarchy. She is not a popular figure among the Congress rank and file. So the best bet for Arzu’s continued relevance in the party is to get Thapa to agree to ‘adjusting’ her in some role after Deuba steps down. In case Thapa declines to do so, the desperate husband might conceivably offer a similar bargain to other aspirants for party presidency. Some say the five-time prime minister, the political animal that he is, will not quietly bow out of politics even after he relinquishes the party chair. That he will continue to pull the strings from behind the curtain. That is unlikely. Deuba’s influence in the party, now at its apogee, will at once decline when he is no longer in a position to dole out plum ministries and party posts. Coming back to Thapa, for all his strengths, it would be a mistake to assume the party presidency will fall into his lap. If, for example, Shekhar Koirala is in the fray, Thapa will be going toe to toe with a formidable foe. “In my reckoning, Koirala can beat Thapa if the two face off in the general convention,” says Tula Narayan Shah, a keen political observer while cupping a glass of steaming peach black tea. The general convention representatives vote in blocks. Shah, a Nepali Congress footsoldier in his student days, thinks the Koirala name still carries a lot of weight for many such Congressi blocks. “Or how could Shashank get the most votes in the election for central committee members in the last general convention? What other qualification did he have?” Also working in Koirala’s favour will be his long preparation for the top job— “while never holding a government portfolio,” Shah adds. Moreover, many in the Congress believe that while Thapa has age on his side, and will get another shot in the future, Koirala, at 74, may not have that luxury. But even the first-level elections to choose Congress general convention delegates have not started. It would thus be premature to talk of new factions which will only start solidifying around a handful of leaders at the end of 2025. The likes of Purna Bahadur Khadka and Bimlendra Nidhi, another two aspirations for the top job who too are long-time Deuba acolytes, would have some say in how things shape up. So would Shashank Koirala and Prakash Man Singh. Yet a compelling case can be made for why the Congress would do well to go into the next general elections under Gagan Thapa. With the country looking for a clean break from the past, this next generation leader with sound intellect and unmatched oratory will be a good electoral fit. He also has a clean image. Again, no other top Congress leader is anywhere close to the MP from Kathmandu-4 on any of these fronts. Yes, Thapa’s popularity has gone down. But if he gets to lead the party again, he is more than capable of regaining much of the lost lustre. A leader who is always in the spotlight is bound to get into some controversies. As has Thapa. Someone who came to prominence during the 2006 April Revolution, he can sometimes sound more like a rabble-rouser than a cool-headed thinker. Really, when you have natural swag, why sweat it? His relations with the party chief have also come under scrutiny. Even though Deuba has made one after another mistake, Thapa has blunted his criticism of the party president. Thapa quietly accepted the seven-point midnight Congress-UML deal even though he, the party’s general secretary, was kept in complete darkness. A consummate politician, Thapa is clearly biding his time. But this also shows he thinks long term—always a good sign in a political leader.It would be hard to argue that the Congress and the larger Nepali polity will be better served with the party electing Shekhar Koirala or any other leader of the older generation than it will be by picking Thapa. If Thapa comes to power in the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, the other two big parties, will also be forced to rethink their ossified leaderships: The UML is now under the thumb of KP Sharma Oli, just like Pushpa Kamal Dahal continues to maintain an absolute grip over the Maoist Centre. At this juncture, of the three major forces, the Congress appears by far the most democratic outfit. A seamless transfer of power to the torchbearer of the next generation will reinforce this image.  \nThe Maoist party, which joined mainstream politics by signing the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2006, has always had a peculiar relation with semantics. In the insurgency days, the top Maoist leaders were not known by their real names but their noms de guerre. Partly, this was done to hide their identity, and partly, it was their way of overcoming individualism and pursuing a larger cause. Thus Pushpa Kamal Dahal became ‘Prachanda’, Baburam Bhattarai ‘Laldhoj’, Barsha Man Pun ‘Ananta’ and so on. The party has itself undergone various name changes to arrive at its current avatar of CPN (Maoist Centre). There are often rumours of the party leaders mulling removing the ‘Maoist’ tag. Despite this seeming flexibility, it must hurt all those involved in the decade-long war when the country’s top court repeatedly rejects their attempts to recognise the janayuddha (‘people’s war’). Most recently, the apex court ruled that it is unconstitutional to use the term in official documents. A year ago, it had rejected the-then Maoist-led government’s efforts to declare a public holiday on ‘People’s War Day’. With their strongest claim to political space—a self-sacrificing war waged for the benefit of the downtrodden and the marginalised communities—legally rejected, the use of violence that took nearly 17,000 lives, and left countless more disabled and ‘disappeared’, will be questioned even more in the days ahead. The Maoists and a section of the intelligentsia continue to talk up the war’s achievements: There would apparently have been no republican federal state without the war. Or a system of reservations for the marginalised communities. (Even this newspaper acknowledges the Maoist role in these developments.) Yet it is as important to factor in the party’s evolution in the post-war years. The causes that the party once held dear—particularly issues of the poorest and most marginalized sections of the society—have repeatedly been sacrificed at the altars of Dahal’s naked quest for power. These days, there is little to choose between the Maoist Centre and the old ‘bourgeois’ parties in the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML that the former rebels once held responsible for all social ills. Times are also changing. Those born in the past three decades have little or no memory of the war. Instead, they have seen how its supposed achievements have been endlessly abused by leaders from across the political spectrum. For these younger folks, the idea of getting political legitimacy through a war waged in the name of Mao—a bloodthirsty dictator from another time and place—just does not sound right. Of late, the CPN (Maoist Centre) party has been making much of its ‘stellar’ showing in the recent bypolls. This, say party leaders, is an indication that their popularity is again on the up. That is unlikely. These small pockets of electoral success aside, indications are that people are highly dissatisfied by the functioning of the Maoist party as well as its chair Dahal. The loss in support among its once core constituencies is particularly alarming. Unless the Maoist leadership is ready to internalise and acknowledge how it has let these constituencies down and to commit to rectifying its mistakes, an electoral comeback looks tough. Unfortunately, for Dahal and his followers, there is no going back to the old-school janayuddha either.   \nLong gone are the smog-free winter days. As soon as the temperatures dip, the bowl-shaped topography of Kathmandu Valley traps pollutants in the atmosphere, making its air one of the most toxic in the world. The problem is not limited to the federal capital and its periphery though, as other cities and districts in the country also fare poorly in this regard. All of Nepal’s 30.7 million people now live in areas where the annual average particulate pollution level exceeds the WHO guideline of 5 micrograms per cubic metre. This has cut the life expectancy of Nepalis by nearly five years, as reported by the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) issued by the Energy Policy Institute of the University of Chicago.Though illegal, the practices of stubble burning in the fields, and open-waste or plastic burning in the backyards of houses, street corners and even public spaces, are widespread. Moreover, construction works on roads and sidewalks that linger for months or years result in much dust and dirt, while contractors often show little urgency to meet the deadlines. Little do people consider that their small part, when extrapolated across a large population, is making the air unbreathable and destroying their health. The systemic neglect of authorities is also exacerbating the air pollution crisis.Breathing in unhealthy air has multiple health consequences. Health workers warn that exposure to foul air can in the short term lead to pneumonia, bronchitis, conjunctivitis, skin allergy, stroke and heart problems. Over time, it can cause severe conditions such as ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases and heart complications. Since the start of the dry season this year, hospitals in the Valley have witnessed a steady rise in the number of patients—mostly children and elderly—with respiratory illnesses. A recent Nepal Health Research Council study shows that children in Kathmandu Valley are particularly vulnerable to air pollution due to their exposure while commuting to and from schools. In response, the Ministry of Forests and Environment has recently asked people to focus on maintaining their vehicles, using clean energy, controlling smoke and dust coming from roads and construction work, and refraining from burning plastic. But such directives are more often ignored than they are heeded, by both the public and authorities. While sprinkling water on roads and sweeping the dust can keep our surroundings clean, these activities are no solutions to the problem of air pollution. Worryingly, promoting clean energy, including in our kitchens, doesn’t seem to be a priority of our political leaders and authorities. Experts also often point to lack of coordination between different agencies to tackle air pollution. We thus need a complete overhaul of the way we manage air pollution. Lasting solutions will emerge only through greater collaboration, for instance, between the local units, and the ministries of transport, health and population and urban development. Local authorities can control open burning through stringent rules and monitoring; the transport ministry too could get serious about phasing out old vehicles that emit pollutants. While pollution from cities in northern India has also been identified as a contributor to poor air quality in Nepali border towns and the capital city of Kathmandu, perhaps the locally generated pollutants are an even bigger threat. If we fail to do our bit to clean our own air, we also lose the moral ground to point fingers at other countries. With the right policies, programmes and mindset, the air we breathe would be a lot healthier.  \nCorruption ails almost every sector in Nepal. It is believed to be one major factor discouraging investors, innovators, entrepreneurs, as well as service seekers. But following tremendous pressure from various sections of the society, government authorities have initiated investigations on some major corruption cases. The fake Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Tribhuvan University land encroachment, gold smuggling and cooperatives deposits embezzlement are cases that have been probed. Even high profile personalities such as a former Speaker, former ministers, top bureaucrats and powerful middlemen have been prosecuted.Currently, the embezzlement of billions of rupees deposited by thousands of people at hundreds of cooperatives across the country remains a hotly-debated issue. Politicians, a former top police official, and key officials running dozens of cooperatives are being investigated. Police have issued red corner notices against those who are on the run after embezzling deposits from various cooperatives. The Rastriya Swatantra Party chair and former home minister Rabi Lamichhane, among other suspects, has been in custody for the past two months over his alleged involvement in the embezzlement. But other politicians and individuals close to top political leaders have been spared, it is alleged, under political pressure. Just like Lamichhane, Nepali Congress Vice-President and lawmaker Dhan Raj Gurung, and federal parliament’s Public Accounts Committee chair Rishikesh Pokharel of the CPN-UML have been linked to the cases of embezzlement of funds from different cooperatives. Yet they were not being probed. Thankfully, there has been a breakthrough. The Morang District Court on Tuesday issued an arrest warrant against 25 suspects including Anjala Koirala, wife of PAC chair Pokharel, in connection with alleged financial irregularities in Uma-Gauri Agricultural Cooperative. Yet little seems to be happening in the case against Gurung. The Central Investigation Bureau of Nepal Police had in October recommended the police headquarter issue a red notice against Gurung’s former wife Jyoti, among others, on charges of embezzling cooperative deposits. Though Dhan Raj and Jyoti officially appear to have divorced, it seems the two were still jointly misusing funds even after the formal divorce. Also, the cross-party Parliamentary Special Probe Committee has suggested the authorities investigate the Congress leader’s involvement.When it comes to past investigations in major corruption scandals, the results have been mixed. The investigation agencies have produced some laudable results in a few cases, while they were criticised in other scams for sparing politicians while punishing civil servants and other individuals. So people still doubt their role. Many people believe investigating agencies, under pressure from influential leaders, first spare the politicians and their kin or, even if they are arrested, the cases against them are watered down to help the suspects get clean chit. Though cases were filed against high profile individuals in the fake refugee case, Lalita Niwas and gold smuggling scams, many of them have already been acquitted. People are thus rightly suspicious. To remove their doubts, first, the agencies should show the courage to work independently and stop waiting for signals from top politicians. Or the flawed justice process will backfire on the top politicians too. If the public comes to see that only those without access to power centres get punished while those close to top politicians and other power centres are spared, their faith in the country’s legal process will erode. So will their trust in the political parties. Now that investigation has started against the spouse of an UML leader, there should now be no delay in probing the Congress leader too.   \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) was formed in August 2021 by a group of dissident CPN-UML leaders including two former party chiefs and ex-prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Jhala Nath Khanal. The party, which has 10 seats in the federal lower house is struggling with organisation building, re-elected Nepal as party chief in July. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Chairman Nepal to hear his assessment of the new party’s three years and his future plans for it.How do you review the first three years of your party?First, we have to start with the question of if the formation of this party was necessary. We made the absolutely right move by revolting [against the CPN-UML leadership’s actions]. We foiled the attempts to trample on the constitution and stopped the autocratic, regressive, rightist and individualistic tendencies from prevailing in Nepali politics. Our moves have been politically, legally as well as constitutionally justified, with even the Supreme Court validating them. After that, we displaced the then [KP Sharma Oli-led] government, and brought national politics on the right track. We then formed this party. Politics doesn’t always go in a straight line. In politics, you face ups and downs, twists and turns and sometimes turbulence. Those who are powerful today could become weak and may disappear over time. Weaker forces may get stronger. Some of our friends say, “Our revolt was right but joining the coalition was wrong”. But it was the need of the time. It is true that we committed some mistakes and couldn’t get enough proportional representation (PR) votes in federal and provincial polls in 2022. We were unnecessarily flexible while making seat allocations with other coalition partners in a number of constituencies. We also strongly opposed the proposals of coalition partners in certain constituencies and fought on our own strength and won seats. For instance, the CPN (Maoist Centre) didn’t cooperate with us in my own constituency in Rautahat. They didn’t vote for us. But I still won. We fought elections in some palikas [local units] on our own and won majority seats there. But in certain areas our local leaders couldn’t properly negotiate with other partners. Now we should neither be over-reliant on the election coalitions nor do we need to criticise it. Others will recognise us only if we increase our strength. We have had mixed experiences in the past three years. We should be encouraged and optimistic about the future.But our observation from outside is that your party failed in the elections. It couldn’t even secure national party status and you have done poorly on the organisation front as well. The situation would be drastically different had all the friends who were initially with us remained active with firm commitment. Some friends lost confidence. Therefore, we couldn’t perform as per the expectations. But our party has produced exemplary results in Madhes Province. We were doing well in Rautahat district even until the latest by-polls. My activeness has never diminished and I have left no stone unturned in terms of inspiring other leaders. But everyone should actively work to build a party. Some people talk big but don’t take responsibility.You touched on what went wrong in terms of securing PR votes. Could you elaborate?Our situation would be much better had we fielded more candidates, at least in provincial seats. Our party chapters and members would have been more active in the constituencies if our candidates were in the field. The Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal made a smart move in this connection. The JSP fielded more candidates for provincial seats. From the start, JSP leaders used to wonder in coalition meetings about how they would get PR votes if their candidates aren’t in the constituencies. As our party members joined the campaigns for common candidates of the coalition, they couldn’t ask for votes in our party’s election symbol ‘pen’ in the PR category. Had we mobilised separate teams to campaign for the PR votes, we could have easily crossed the threshold for PR seats in the House of Representatives. Don’t you think the party is top-heavy with senior leaders while failing to attract new faces?We have no dearth of leaders or cadres. But we have a problem in mobilising them. In our party, the monitoring and evaluation system is weak. You can’t make one answerable unless you have an evaluation system in writing. Therefore, this time we have assigned responsibilities for just a year. Now they have to submit periodic reports of activities in their respective committees. We became too lenient and didn’t punish those who didn’t work. You led a huge organisation in the UML for one-and-half decades. But you appear to be struggling to fix issues in this relatively small organisation.See, people are becoming more selfish, self-centered and lazy. So, we have to make our evaluation system strong. As we have a strong organisation and the right ideology and values, we should now launch pro-people movements and connect with the public.Do you think the party failed to attract and mobilise people due to its continuous engagement in the government since formation and lack of attractive agenda?We don’t lack agendas. We have identified and enlisted many issues directly linked to the people’s livelihood in our political paper. We failed to reach the doorsteps of the people. For instance, if there is violence against a woman, our women chapter should immediately reach there. Likewise, the student wing should actively work for the rights of students. Some of our friends say we shouldn’t have stood in favour of endorsement of the MCC [Millennium Challenge Corporation’s compact]. They argued it was being implemented to encircle our neighbour China and establish a military base in our country. We suspected the same. But our country had already signed on to that. Different interpretations of the concept related to the project emerged. Some described it as a part of the Indo-Pacific Strategy. When we studied the matter, we found CPN-UML chair KP Oli was all set to endorse the compact without any changes in the text, bypassing us. Oli put forward five conditions for that before then prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba. The conditions included impeaching Speaker Agni Sapkota for not taking action against us [UML had demanded that the Speaker strip 14 lawmakers who quit UML to form the new party of their positions], scrapping our party’s registration in the Election Commission and removing us from the coalition. But Deuba ji stood against that. Then, we found a middle way, which was to endorse the compact with a 12-point explanatory note. So that was the right decision. The government earlier this month signed the framework for the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) cooperation agreement with China. What is your view on this?It is natural to take it [BRI] forward as we have implemented the MCC of the US and have joined hands with other countries and multilateral agencies to carry out our development activities. The projects to be built under the BRI have no strategic or military connections and are based on mutual benefit. So there is no need to be suspicious and we have to focus on how to take maximum benefits from projects under the BRI.Just a few days ago, you met and talked to Bamdev Gautam, who appears ready to join your party. What is the progress on this?He has said he is ready to join and accept our party’s decisions. We are discussing this. He has played an important role in critical political junctures. He strongly supported me during the second People’s Movement in 2006. A political party needs such leaders. We are thinking of concluding this process [of welcoming him] soon.What about Bhim Rawal joining the party?Unhappy with the party leadership, he has been inactive in the UML but he has not made up his mind to join our party.Is finalising Gautam’s hierarchy and role in the party taking time?There won’t be an issue in the case of Bamdev ji. But overall, the number of leaders in our party is big. In the Chinese Communist Party, there are only seven members in the Politburo Standing Committee and 17 members in Other Politburo Members. But there are 24 members in our party’s central secretariat, 41 in the standing committee and 108 members in the politburo. Those who get a candidacy in the election celebrate but those who don’t get a ticket become inactive. Some others fight for ministerial posts. Yet others complain about not getting a ‘lucrative’ ministry. We have to manage them all.What about reunifying the party with the UML or the Maoist Centre? Many say leaders are more comfortable with the Maoist Centre but party cadres are for rejoining the UML.Most of our cadres are from the UML background. That might have played a role. But at present there is no possibility of our reunification with the UML. Also, the situation isn’t right to forge unity with the Maoist Centre.It is said that there is pressure from party members for reunification with the UML?That’s not true. There is a negative view about us in the UML and therefore our party rank and file wouldn’t be ready to surrender. Some might be lobbying for entry into the UML for personal benefits. Even if some join the UML, it won’t be easy for them there.But some noted leaders such as Ram Kumari Jhakri who had strongly supported you in the course of building this party have said that the Unified Socialist can’t run like this and that it is better to merge with the UML?I also enquired about her remarks but she said her intent had been misunderstood. But I repeat that there is no possibility of unity with the UML. We studied the possibility of unity with the Maoist Centre but concluded that we can’t accept Maoism and we also found their election symbol inappropriate. So the process has stopped. For now, we will concentrate on strengthening our own party.How is the Unified Socialist different from the UML?Our’s is a policy-driven party and not leader-centric. Committee system prevails in our organisation, not the leader’s orders. We discard rightist approaches and follow revolutionary ideas. We don’t see these qualities in the UML. Only our party has a policy of ‘Socialism with Nepali Characteristics’. We prioritise our agenda based on justice, fair distribution, production and good governance. There was a period when socialism stressed only on equality and therefore some termed it a distribution of poverty but we believe socialism as a principle of prosperity. Capitalism focuses only on profits even at the cost of people’s lives and wars but socialism values people’s lives and livelihoods. So, we are clearly against capitalism and in favour of socialism. But there are different forms of capitalism. We are for promoting national capitalism and eliminating comprador capitalists. We need to invite and welcome foreign investment to increase production in the country.Your party held its general convention in July first week and it took months to elect other office bearers and assign roles and responsibilities. Why?It shouldn’t have happened. Some wrong elements entered our party. Some showed immaturity by raising the issue of ‘new generation’. That spoiled the situation. Building a party is not easy. It calls for many things including ideological clarity, capacity to lead the organisation efficiently and an accepted personality. We have to learn from this episode and remove the mistrust that cropped up in this course. \nIt has been five months since the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML formed a coalition government on July 15 by stepping on the seven-point deal inked on July 1. How is the coalition of the two biggest political parties faring? The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Krishna Khanal, a professor of political science, for his insights.How do you evaluate the performance of the Congress-UML government based on the pledges they made at the time of coalition formation?Two biggest parties getting together to form a government is a bit unusual in the system we have adopted. The strength of the system is that the government can be made accountable by a strong opposition. But when the two biggest parties join hands to run the government, the opposition in the House becomes weak. This is a concern. The Congress and the UML have had joint governments in critical junctures in the past. Now, there is no extraordinary situation requiring them to forge a coalition but they justified it saying it would end political instability. Their argument was that unreasonable bargaining of smaller parties made the prime ministers weak. That’s partially true. However, the crux of the matter is that they wanted to enjoy consolidated power. KP Oli wanted to be prime minister and the Congress leaders who were out of power wanted to return to Singha Durbar. So they signed the seven-point deal with the pledge of amending the constitution.Has this coalition been a success? What are the initial indications?There are certain curious things. The seven-point agreement doesn’t say the UML will hand over government leadership to the Congress in the second phase of their partnership. It says, after two years, UML chair Oli will hand it over to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. It shows how our parties have become leader-centric instead of institution-centric. After all, Oli and Deuba are the chiefs and parliamentary leaders of their respective parties and they are the ones who will lead the government. Still they wished to specifically mention their names, which indicates they still feel insecure. Likewise, Prime Minister Oli says that he is handing over power to Deuba in July 2026. Recently he said he is handing it over after 18 months. Despite there being a written agreement, he keeps repeating the timeline. This suggests mutual mistrust due to past records of betrayal. It is true that the Congress and the UML together have a strong majority in the House and, with the backing of a few other smaller forces, they can manage two-thirds majority needed to amend the constitution. But when it comes to political issues, even the small parties in the coalition are hardly on the same page. So numerical strength alone won’t work. Hence there has been no progress on constitution amendment in the past five months. These pledges were made just to create a pretext to get to power.Is the present government any different to the erstwhile Dahal-led coalition, particularly on delivery?No. In the seven-point agreement, they pledged to improve the ailing economy. We don’t find any reform and the economy is still stagnant. I can’t recall a single thing this government has done that is worth appreciating. The only thing this coalition has achieved is ending unusual power manoeuverings by Prachanda [Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. The way Dahal was switching alliance partners between the Congress and the UML was unnatural. The present coalition ended the trend, at least for now. Also, some unhealthy activities taking place in provinces have been stopped. But the government has utterly failed to provide any relief to the people. What about the process of amending the constitution?The Congress and the UML leaders have often blamed the proportional representation (PR) electoral system for the country’s political instability. The UML proposed to limit the scope of the PR system to the National Assembly and some Congress leaders have also floated this idea. After the formation of this government, many people assumed that this coalition may take some action to implement those propositions. But doing so is not easy. Despite a strong majority in the House, the Congress and the UML alone can’t amend the constitution. Other small parties won’t support them to water down the PR system. The top leaders are conspicuously silent as they know diverse issues are going to open up once they start the process. For instance, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party wants to revive Hindu monarchy and the Madhes-based parties have their own grievances. Moreover, if you analyse the election results since 2008, it’s not difficult to infer that not only small parties but even the major forces will think twice before making any changes to the PR system. Be it big or small, old or new parties, all have gotten a significant number of seats under the PR category. In the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008, the Congress and the UML were in crisis. It was the PR system that saved them from being pushed into an existential crisis. Besides that, there is one big political reason behind the adoption of this electoral system and that is to ensure representation of various underprivileged communities in state organs. We can’t forget that context. Hence the Congress and UML leaders have been silent on the constitution amendment in the past couple of months.Is there any need to review or amend the constitution?There is a need to seriously review and analyse the problems faced in the course of implementing the constitution in the past nine years. For instance, the vice-president has no role. He can be made ex-officio chair of the National Assembly, as in India. Then, the state doesn’t need to elect the upper house chair. This option was discussed during constitution writing as well. Recently, we conducted by-polls to fill the vacant positions of chiefs of local units. These polls were unnecessary as there can be a provision to entrust the deputy chiefs with the responsibility of carrying out the chief’s duties when the position goes vacant. There is a need for a comprehensive review and changes in some provisions based on the practical experience of statute implementation. But there are different parties and groups that want to raise different political agendas. For instance, some want a more powerful federal system while others want to scrap the system and revive Hindu monarchy. How should we review the national charter and what kind of mechanism will be right for that?The best way is through a review commission composed of politicians and subject experts. But leaders don’t trust independent experts who don’t follow their instructions. Forming a body of experts loyal to the leaders is meaningless. Therefore, a special parliamentary committee can be entrusted with this task. The panel will be composed of members from political parties based on their strength in the House. The parties and other stakeholders can submit their formal proposals to the committee and the experts can give their inputs to the same panel. The body can help give shape to the ongoing debates and discussions will take place in a more organised and formal way. It can conduct a thorough study of the complications seen in the course of constitution implementation. My emphasis is not on amending the constitution on political grounds but from the perspectives of removing difficulties experienced in the course of implementation. For instance, provinces have failed to prove their relevance. Now, we need to study where the problems are. But I don’t think the political parties are going to work on this issue with the seriousness it deserves. Leaders, of late, have proposed to increase the threshold to secure seats under the PR category, which can be done by amending election laws. They have floated the idea of increasing the PR threshold to five percent. [At present, it is three percent at the federal and 1.5 percent at the provincial level]. If it is increased to five percent, hardly four or five political parties may qualify for the PR seats. So this is not an appropriate proposal. To ensure political stability, we have to instead develop a system supportive of a coalition culture. The problem lies in our leaders and not in the constitution. For instance, why did Prachanda switch alliances multiple times after the last election? There is no point in blaming the system for instability. To discuss and debate all these issues, we need a review body.What is your analysis of the recent local by-polls results?The voting pattern shows that the big parties couldn’t increase their vote shares and failed to attract voters. The Congress lost more seats in comparison to the last by-polls. The UML had mixed results while the Maoist Centre made some gains. As it fought single-handedly this time, the Congress lost some seats that it had won with the support of alliance partners last time. This is natural. The Maoist Centre appears to have benefitted by being in the opposition and as it concentrated its strengths in select areas for the past few months. Party chief Dahal himself visited some remote local units. The Congress doesn’t appear serious about reviewing its poor performance while the UML has decided to study the matter and find what went wrong. The Maoist leaders look excited but the party has not made much progress in popular votes. There are assumptions of some informal collaborations between the Maoist Centre and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. The way Dahal has defended Rabi Lamichhane in recent days backs the assumption.Why do you think the performance of new forces including the RSP and Janamat were poor in the by-polls?My assumption is that voters rethought the need to change the party of their choice if the main objective of the leaders from new parties is to be ministers. RSP chief Rabi Lamichhane insisted on becoming home minister. In the meantime, recent investigations have shown his linkages to cooperative scams. People might have thought that he is not a clean person. These factors might have played a role. Last time, people supported new forces not to make their leaders ministers but for political reforms. The chief minister from Janamat Party who is leading the provincial government in Madhesh formed a 20-member Cabinet, which is the biggest ever there. He downsized it only after severe criticism. Such developments certainly play a role in elections. These are just assumptions. We can’t jump to conclusions but it is safe to say that Nepali voters are consistently trying to find better alternatives.While there were reports of former President Bidya Devi Bhandari rejoining the UML to return to active politics, former Vice-President Nanda Bahadur Pun is most likely to join the Maoist Centre. What kind of precedent will this set?I don’t see serious problems in former vice-presidents rejoining active politics as they don’t play any vital role as vice-presidents. But the issue of former Presidents returning to active politics is serious as such a precedent will invite serious anomalies. Though the constitution and laws don't bar former presidents from making such a comeback, politics should be guided by certain values, principles and convictions. Bhandari’s return to active politics will be unfortunate. It should be stopped. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli returned home on December 5 after a four-day official visit to China. During the visit, the two countries signed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Framework Cooperation agreement. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Bishnu Rimal, chief advisor to the prime minister, who was one of the key interlocutors during the framework agreement negotiations, for insights on how the deals were finalised between the two countries.There are many queries about the details of the agreements signed between Nepal and China last week. Please tell us about the key points.Nepal and China had been exchanging documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative of China since 2020, under the BRI implementation plan. While signing any agreement, the two countries engage in rigorous negotiations and at times it takes a long time even to finalise a word. This time, we signed a framework agreement, which is like a basket, where we have put many things. It’s different from a memorandum of understanding (MoU). In the agreement, we have described its background, principles, objectives, the modality of mobilising financial resources and implementing mechanisms. Even the previous government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal had planned to finalise it but it didn’t in the end. Now we have taken it ahead. The new agreement should be understood in a context. In 2016, we were in government [during Oli’s first tenure] and we visited Beijing. At the time, China was supporting Nepal through the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network (THMDCN) package. Later, the support was provided through the BRI and the THMDCN became a part of it. Nepal reached an MoU to this effect in 2017. After that, an implementation plan needed to be signed. Following the formation of the present government, we held discussions on this. The two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML—formed a four-member team for this specific purpose. Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and lawyer Semanta Dahal from the Nepali Congress and Yubaraj Khatiwada ji and myself from the UML were in the team. In the past, we have reached several agreements with China, India, the United States, Japan and various other countries and sought support from them. But we haven’t been able to properly utilise the support. Our [taskforce’s] focus was to ensure best use of the pledged amount and implement the agreements. At first, we studied the documents exchanged after 2020. At the beginning we forged consensus between the UML and the Congress and then shared the document with the Chinese side because it can only be implemented after it is acceptable for both sides. This time, we wanted to take the implementation process ahead because Nepal joined the BRI process years ago. Nepal has already joined China’s Global Development Initiative, which is an international development concept. But there were some confusions about our participation in development projects under the BRI. There needed to be more clarity on our side. At times, it has been dragged into controversy. We wanted to dispel rumours and confusions.First of all we all should know that the BRI is a framework and the agreement we signed is a basket deal. Later, we will select specific projects and negotiate on particular details and conditions. In fact, the debate ahead of the prime minister’s visit was driven by whether to take loans or grants from China. That was wrong. It is rather a project-based approach. On certain projects, we need all grants while on certain others, we may jointly develop them. Still in other projects, we have to seek concessional loans. All these things depend on what project we are talking about. If a project can pay back the loan, that could be dealt accordingly. But our discussions were driven by the concept of loan versus grant. Even top leaders got swayed by such narratives and reacted accordingly. China has declared huge grants to Nepal multiple times since 2016. But we haven’t been able to use them as we have to earmark the amounts and seek them. First, we have to say that we are going to use this money in these projects. We at the task force concluded that the amount of the grants pledged by China is enough for us for now. There is no need to take out a loan now. Our priority is to get the grants that have been stuck for years. Do we need to select certain projects for that?Yes, we have to first finalise the projects and prepare business plans. We can explore other options only if the grant money is insufficient for a particular project. For instance, if we start working on a cross-border railway, we would discuss whether the grant money is sufficient and whether to seek more grants or go for loans. We aren’t in that stage now. We are yet to receive the grant announced during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in 2019. Similarly, grants were announced during the China visits of then President Bidya Devi Bhandari, first President Rambaran Yadav and our prime minister KP Sharma Oli. Also, this time, the Chinese President has announced 500 million RMB in assistance. So, again, first we have to work to receive and use the grant money. For instance, recently, the Chinese side announced to provide electric vehicles worth US$10 million as support through the Chinese embassy. The EVs include public buses, ambulances and school vans but they release them only after we provide the specifications of the vehicles that we need. The amount we sign as a budgetary support can be used wherever we want but other sums are released only after we earmark them for certain projects. After a long negotiation, Nepal and China have agreed on the term ‘aid assistance financing’. What does that mean?During the negotiation, we had used the term ‘grant and different financing modalities’. Later, we agreed to replace the word ‘grant’ with ‘aid’. We did so as we wanted to keep the door open in terms of seeking support from a country. If we say that we won’t receive any support except grants, it creates complications in the overall investment scenario. The Chinese government may provide a certain amount of grant to the government of Nepal but it doesn’t give it to the private sector.If Nepal’s private sector plans to attract investment from China, the World Bank, the ADB or any other agencies, for example for a mega hydro project, they may not get it as the Chinese side knows that Nepal accepts only grants and no other form of investment. Such a condition creates complications as this agreement is applicable even for the private sector. Therefore, we didn’t want to close the door. We can’t say we accept loans from this country but not from the other. We accept assistance that serves our national interest.Will the negotiations now onward be project-specific then?Yes. It will be project and proposal specific. Such issues will be negotiated only when we discuss a certain project. Therefore, the ongoing debate over grants versus loan is pointless. For instance, we didn’t receive certain portions of the assistance announced by India immediately after the 2015 earthquakes. Such is also the case with China and with other countries on occasions as the conditions attached to them weren’t acceptable to us.After the failure in operating Pokhara Regional International Airport due to lack of business plans, people are now suspicious about the utilisation of any assistance fruitfully.How can you say the Pokhara airport project is a failure? First, one should study the airport’s capacity and check how many passengers are flying to Pokhara now. A good number of people are flying there. I think the interest rate on the loan we took from China to build the airport is no different to the rate we receive from the World Bank, the IMF and other multilateral agencies. We can debate whether we have been able to operate the airport in its full capacity. But there is no need to scandalise it unnecessarily.Ahead of the prime minister’s visit, there were voices that Nepal should seek a waiver of Pokhara airport loan from China. What happened?Let me ask you a question. Imagine, you took a loan from Rastriya Banijya Bank to meet your needs. Say, there is a government led by a leader who favours you. Can the prime minister waive off your bank loan? No. You have to follow the system. So your question is wrong. The Pokhara airport deal is not a grant. It’s a commercial deal. Those who run the government can’t use the language of Durga Prasai, who threatens not to pay back bank loans. What are the agreements on road connectivity and cross-border railway projects?We have included five points under the infrastructure-urban development project. These are Tokha-Chhahare Tunnel, Hilsa Simkot Road Project, Kathmandu-Khandbari Road, Kimathanka Bridge, the cross-border railway project from Rasuwagadhi to Kathmandu and the Amargadhi City Hall. Likewise, we have included a cross-border transmission line to start energy trade with China. Under education and health, we agreed to establish universities and colleges. The Chinese side is carrying out a feasibility study of the railway project with a plan to complete it by 2026. Once the study is complete, we will discuss the funding modalities and business plans.What is the status of the Tokha-Chhahare tunnel project?The China side is in a position to complete its feasibility study. After that, construction work will start.Nepal has signed so many agreements with China. While we have progressed a lot on paper, there is little progress on the ground. Will the present agreement make any substantive change in this connection?Nepal is behind on monitoring and follow up. We should have formed bilateral mechanisms and monitored work progress. Now, there is a sense of urgency in the government to expedite development works. An inter-agency mechanism will be formed within our government. It will monitor and facilitate the work and the line ministries will execute the plans.Why are the agreements signed with China not made public, unlike the deals inked with other countries?There is no problem in making them public because there is nothing to hide. But all agreements aren’t made public. The MCC Compact had to be taken to the parliament as people were divided over it. Then, it was publicly debated. Likewise, people are now expressing their curiosity towards the BRI documents. But there are many projects people don’t care about. When needed, the documents can be made public as nothing can be hidden these days. And there is nothing wrong in making them public.UMl’s coalition partner Congress was reportedly reluctant to sign the framework agreement. What was its concern?That is a wrong narrative. Both the UML and the Congress were on the same page. It was possible to conclude the agreements because we had consensus.But the Congress leaders expressed their concerns in public ahead of the visit and even after the signing of the deals.We have to follow the party’s official decisions, not the statements of individual leaders. How would it have been possible to reach agreements if there were differences in the two-party taskforce, in the leadership and the party’s official positions? It’s a Nepal-China agreement jointly done by the UML and the Congress, and backed by all other parties. The prime minister convened a meeting of former prime ministers and foreign ministers ahead of his visit. All of them advised the prime minister to sign the agreement with China. Why was the signing of the agreement delayed?While signing a bilateral agreement, we can’t think only from our perspective. Negotiation always takes long. The joint statement has stated that the two sides are ready to sign the BRI framework as soon as possible. It took time for us to share the documents with the Chinese side after we reached Beijing. It’s not like two leaders just sit, discuss and sign on that. They have to consult concerned ministries, departments and officials. The Chinese worked overnight after we submitted the documents. My impression is that the Chinese side showed magnanimity and adopted a short-cut approach and signed on the deals. They were ready to sign the agreements on our conditions. That was a wonderful gesture.What were the specific points of contention and how were they resolved?We substantially edited the documents that were exchanged in the past, making them more specific and converting them into a framework of cooperation. Therefore, the Chinese side needed at least a day to study them. They argued that it would work even without mentioning the word ‘grant’. In view of the narratives in Nepal, we proposed to use ‘grant’ or a word with similar meaning. Then, we proposed ‘aid assistance financing’, and they accepted the term.How will the new deal be implemented?There used to be confusion about whether a certain project is under the BRI. China said even the Pokhara airport project is under the BRI while we said it was initiated before that. Now onward, all projects with China will be under the BRI cooperation. All the financing and investments from China will enter Nepal through the BRI window. We will prioritise the projects already proposed and under study such as the railway project, Tokha-Chhahare tunnel, and Madan Bhandari University. We have agreed to strengthen connectivity on border points and work will be expedited there. That will help transform Nepal from a land-locked into a land-linked country.Why are the projects being developed with Chinese involvement so slow?These days the Chinese side tells us to give projects only after clearing the sites. For instance, the 17-km Syafrubeshi-Rasuwagadhi road is to be built by Chinese grants. There is one transmission pole standing in the way. We are yet to remove it from the construction site. They haven’t started the work citing the same reason. Creating an environment to work on the field is our responsibility. It’s not that only China-built projects are slow. Such is also the story with our projects with other countries and agencies. Even in the case of the MCC projects, it took a long time to finalise many issues. We are too slow in implementing agreements and executing projects. First, we have to do some retrospection and improve our efficiency.  \nWang Peng, a research fellow from the Institute of State Governance at Huazhong University, Wuhan, was previously Deputy Secretary-General of the National Academy of Belt and Road Green Development (NABRGD) Beijing. Peng, a keen observer of South Asian geopolitics, was recently in Kathmandu to participate in ‘Kantipur Conclave-2024’. He sat down with the Post’s Purushottam Poudel and Kantipur’s Jagdishor Panday to discuss a host of issues. Excerpt:How have Nepal-China relations evolved in recent times? Generally, bilateral ties between Nepal and China have been stable. Politically, China’s Nepal policy has been stable too. Even though the administration in Nepal has changed, Kathmandu still has a stable and friendly policy towards China. Relations are progressing steadily. But we still have room for progress. Nepal’s Prime Minister is visiting China in the first week of December. This is a perfect opportunity for the Nepali and Chinese governments to enhance mutual understanding and political trust. Face-to-face meetings between the leaders of two countries are crucial. Due to the Himalayas, many Chinese people, including me, consider Nepal a country far away. But actually, we are alongside each other, not far. Nepal is an hour’s distance from Lasha and a few hours from Chengdu, which is very close. Despite being a close neighbour, China is often accused of not investing enough in Nepal, at least as compared to its other neighbours. Why is this so? There is no need to compare countries as every country has its own conditions. China’s investment in Nepal is significant, especially considering Nepal’s current economic size, population, and capability to use foreign capital effectively. We may talk about the cooperation between China and Pakistan, with the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) as a flagship BRI program. China indeed has a massive investment in Pakistan. China has good relations with Pakistan for many reasons, one of them being that Pakistani politicians usually do not play the so-called “China card”. Despite political changes in Pakistan, relations between Beijing and Islamabad are seldom harmed. China is equal to every partner within the BRI framework, so the key variable essentially is the local leaders’ political choices and their ability to build consensus in domestic politics.What are you trying to suggest when you say Pakistan does not play China card? Many Chinese International Relations scholars, including me, appreciate Pakistan. What we appreciate about Pakistan is that despite their internal political differences, there is a bottom line that none of them uses China as a card. Because of this, Chinese companies dare to invest in Pakistan. This is good—good for these companies and good for the local guys—and this has created more than 10,000 jobs for the local guys over the past few years. In this way, China and Pakistan have accumulated a high level of strategic trust. Non-intervention has been the fundamental principle of Chinese foreign policy. In most developing countries, the government often changes. The country’s people can change the government if they think it has done no good to the citizens. We only hope that politicians do not use China as weapons when fighting for power. So the goal should be to devise a win-win plan to benefit both sides. You mentioned China’s investment preferences abroad. But don’t you think that the investment decisions of a democratic government and an undemocratic one like China will be different? China is a democratic country. People say that China is not a democratic country since it does not have an election. But the Chinese leaders are under intense pressure to think about history. The Chinese government and the leaders should work for the benefit of all the citizens of the country, not just for their supporters. For example, Donald Trump doesn’t need to serve all American people. Even if he supports the people who supported him during the election, his work is done. However, in China, this is not the case. The Chinese government should reconcile different peoples and encourage joint development of the country. A country like China, which is big both in terms of people and land mass, will split if the government does not tread cautiously. That’s China’s nightmare. We have suffered many tragedies in history, so we don’t want this kind of thing to happen again. The Chinese Communist Party, government and high-ranking leaders believe in history. That is why they try to create or design five-year institutions, projects, and reform plans.For example, the Chinese still celebrate Deng Xiaoping’s legacy. Despite being the leader who was not elected, did Deng use power arbitrarily? No. He prudently used his power to ensure that even 50 years down the lane, the country’s people remember him as a leader who greatly benefitted them. Other Chinese political leaders have also taken responsibility for all Chinese people and have made significant reforms to create an environment for business, and for investment in new technology, such as AI and space technology. How do you assess China’s relationship with South Asian countries in general? We should not indulge in conflict. We need resolution and reconciliation with India in the border conflict. All the neighbouring countries, including Nepal, have no border conflict. Apart from India and Bhutan, China has no border conflict with our neighbouring countries. Bhutan is happy to sign a border contract with China, but maybe they are waiting for the message from New Delhi. China will not exert any pressure. It is reasonable for China to be silent about other countries’ internal affairs. Sometimes, the decisions of neighbouring countries are not suitable for China’s interests, but China often keeps quiet and waits for good things to happen. We don’t have any land ambition in our neighbouring countries; we have enough land. If so, why is there conflict in the South China Sea? We don’t have land ambition, so we don’t want an inch of land from other countries. At the same time, we are determined not to abandon an inch of our land.If you look at the United Nations P-5 countries, which are permanent security council members, China is the most prudent country in which decisions are not made by weapons. In South Asia, China-India relations have again started to improve. It's a good beginning. China's relations with other South Asian countries, including Nepal, are stable. China and India are ancient civilisations. We have enough power to solve our problems together. We don’t need a third party’s long hand. We don’t need this kind of teaching. We are brothers; if we have problems, we can solve them together. The best way to resolve the problem between China and India is to develop mutual political trust, security resolution, and economic cooperation, which I believe will happen. Thanks to the potential threat from Donald Trump’s reelection, the two leaders of China and India have used their political wisdom to make changes in advance and create a better atmosphere for the future. Apart from security, what are China’s other concerns in Nepal?The bottom line in China’s foreign policy with neighbouring countries is peace and stability. If you read the Chinese line, we admire mutual respect. We desire friendly countries to commit to ‘One China’. Second, China would also like to promote economic cooperation with Nepal. Not only with Nepal but also with all countries. We want a simple process of import and export, a good business environment, and transparency in law and policy. If the above-mentioned things are achieved, Chinese companies will dare to increase their investment [in Nepal]. Nepal has long been an adamant supporter of ‘One China policy’. But now it has also committed to uphold ‘One China principle’? What does this shift entail for Nepal?To be precise, there is no difference. China’s bottom line is principle; for our friends, that’s policy. If they accept the One China principle, they will conduct a One China policy, which means they will not develop official contact with Taiwan. Earlier in Nepal, there used to be a discourse that Nepal could be a bridge between India and China, but you have come up with a larger perspective that Nepal could not only be a door to South Asia but also to East Asia. Can you elaborate?We don’t say Nepal or any other country should do this or that. We say we expect something. Frankly, China and India are both robust in population, land mass, and economies. Additionally, India is a young country. China also has its own advantage. Nepal has been blocked geographically by these two countries. But Nepal can potentially be the hub, not limited to the periphery. At least in the next three decades, both China and India can offer the most attractive economic opportunities in the world. If Nepal treads cautiously, it can enjoy the benefit of its location. Geography is constant, but political geography is variable and changes.If China and India go against each other, it might be a nightmare for the Nepali people. But, if China-India come together, even if not like in the 1950s, to make a rational decision not to let the border conflict escalate and promote trade, Nepal can enjoy its location as the intermediary rather than as a bridge. Rather than a bridge, Nepal should be a port. In this way, Nepal can earn a lot with China and India because both countries should get permission from Nepal to use its ports to export and import the goods they want. Bring goods from China’s Tibet Autonomous Region to Nepal and then transit to India. Bring goods from Indian cities to Nepal and transit to China via Tibet Autonomous Region. It is a very short distance, and much better. China is never envious of Nepal and India’s bilateral ties. We will never put sand in the wheels of Kathmandu-New Delhi relations. We know you are friends. But don’t make the friendship exclusive; it should be inclusive.You mentioned that China does not meddle in the internal affairs of other countries. But China has tried to bring communist parties in Nepal together and has been holding ideological discussions with these parties. Isn’t this selective engagement a form of meddling?First, one should know that in China, “international affairs” (among the governments of sovereign countries) are handled by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs (中华人民共和国外交部) under the central government, the same as in other countries. At the same time, “inter-party affairs” (between the CPC and all other friendly parties in the world) are handled by the International Department, Central Committee of CPC (中共中央对外联络部) within the Party system.The mission of both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the International Department of the CPC Central Committee is to promote mutual understanding, friendship and cooperation between the Chinese government, the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people and governments, political parties and peoples of other countries, but the division of labor between the two is slightly different. There are some misreadings and misunderstandings.First, it said that the International Department of the CPC only communicates with communist or left-wing parties. That is wrong. In fact, the International Department speaks on behalf of the Communist Party of China and all political parties around the world that are friendly to China, including both the ruling and opposition parties.Second, it said that the International Department had contacts with opposition parties in other countries. This statement is also wrong. The International Department and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs have their own priorities. The ministry and the government agencies carry out diplomatic activities and naturally deal with the ruling parties of other countries.However, the International Department of the CPC Central Committee conducts exchanges with all political parties that are friendly to China, in line with international norms and practices. Everything is above board and conducive to mutual understanding, mutual trust and win-win cooperation between the two governments, two parties and two peoples.“Non-intervention in internal affairs” (不干涉他国内政) and “foreign affairs are not defined by ideology” (不以意识形态划线) are two major principles of the CPC and the Chinese government.As Sun Yeli, spokesman for the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China (CPC) said on October 15, 2022, the CPC maintains different forms of contacts with more than 600 political parties and organisations in more than 170 countries, and the international circle of friends is growing.“The more friends, the better.” As Sun Yeli said, for a long time, and on the basis of the principles of independence, complete equality, mutual respect and non-interference in each other's internal affairs, the Communist Party of China has had extensive exchanges with friendly political parties and political forces of other countries, and its international circle of friends has been growing.In recent years, China has hosted the World Political Party Leaders Summit and high-level Dialogue, attended by more than 500 leaders of political parties and organisations from over 160 countries and more than 10,000 political party representatives. The development of political party relations has driven and promoted the development of state-to-state relations and enhanced the understanding and friendship between the peoples.Sun Yeli said the CPC attaches importance to exchanges with Marxist political parties in other countries. Through theoretical exchanges and policy dialogue, they jointly explore the path of socialist development suitable for their respective national conditions and explore their respective paths to realise the localisation of Marxism.“The CPC's foreign affairs are not defined by ideology,” Sun said, adding that the CPC is willing to make friends with all kinds of political parties of all countries, irrespective of the ideology they uphold, as long as they are friendly to China and willing to conduct exchanges with the CPC.How is China seeing Nepal’s Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s Beijing visit, which will commence on December 2? Nepal’s prime minister, especially from the communist parties, often visits China. Big promises and agreements are made during the visits, but they seldom materialise. How hopeful is China about Prime Minister Oli’s visit this time?I am not a foreign ministry official. So I cannot represent the Chinese government. Over the past decade, China-Nepal relations have made remarkable progress. Political mutual trust between the two sides has steadily increased, and economic cooperation has yielded initial results. There is an old saying in China, “haste makes waste.” In other words, whether it is to develop bilateral relations or the economy through economic and trade cooperation, these things must conform to the objective economic conditions and cannot be rushed. Steady improvement and steady progress are the best. \nFormer Indian chief election commissioner SY Quraishi is a strong advocate of credible elections and inclusive democracy. He has extensively spoken and written on how increasing flow of money in elections is taking away the level playing field for candidates from different backgrounds. During his recent visit to Kathmandu, Binod Ghimire of the Post and Suresh Raj Neupane and Rajesh Mishra of Kantipur talked to him on a range of issues from electoral reforms, challenges in maintaining election sanctity in the age of generative artificial intelligence, to why the world is swinging right. Excerpts:Elections and democracy are intertwined. However, recent election results the world over are being seen as a threat to law and democracy. How do you see this phenomenon?Democracy and elections are two sides of the same coin. Without elections, there is no democracy. And worldwide, for the past 10 years, there is a swing towards the right, even in the US. In India, of course, we have been on the right for the past 10 years and our prime minister got a third term, though with a bit of reduced majority.The other thing is that in the past 10-12 years, there has been a debate on whether democracy is on a decline worldwide. The fact is that several indices of democracy indicate the decline. But people’s will cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. Sometimes they go to the left, sometimes, they move to the right. We cannot call it a threat to democracy. The democracy indices which I mentioned have a different classification.First, there are full democracies. Then there are flawed democracies. Third is hybrid democracies. The fourth is an authoritarian regime. So even in South Asia, we have one or two countries which are authoritarian, like Afghanistan and Pakistan. Their ranking keeps going up or down depending on the electoral and democratic performance. In India, the right-wing is ruling, but they lost some majority. They are now depending on two other parties, which are not considered right-wing. Of course, Trump got an absolute majority this time winning both popular vote and electoral votes. He also won both the houses. So, this is what can make him dictatorial. As it is, he is mercurial, and everybody is speculating how he is going to behave. Let’s wait and see.We can agree that people cannot be taken as a threat to democracy. But can we say that the elections, rather than complementing the spirit of democracy, are turning into tools to endorse majoritarianism?Well, people’s will is supreme. If they have chosen absolute governments, if they have given large majorities, you cannot blame the people. Many times a lot of money is being used in elections, and only the rich people get to win elections. In India, for instance, 93 percent of MPs who got elected are crorepatis [multi-millionaires]. Now, law provides for a ceiling on expenditure, so that level playing field is established, where you and I can also contest.But then, the ceiling on expenditure in India has one flaw—it is only for candidates, not political parties. This negates or neutralises the purpose of the ceiling. You can’t spend more than 1 crore, but your party can spend 20 crores on you. So where is the level playing field? Some people say there should be state funding of elections. I oppose the idea but recommend state funding of political parties. It is difficult to monitor election expenditure because of black money. Funding political parties with cheques is what I recommend because it is easy to monitor. So you think election management is more of a problem than the electoral system?Actually, both are important, because obviously the management follows what the system prescribes. There are laws, there are rules, and they have to be followed. For instance, on political funding, there is a cap on expenditure provided by law, and the election management body implements it. Therefore, we have to improve both. Both are equally important. We say public consciousness has increased with time, but there are also concerns that people are picking right-wing leaders. So what is wrong?Actually, it’s a good question but difficult to answer. Why is it that the whole world is turning right? But there are also states like Austria where everybody was thinking the extreme right was winning, but then liberals won. So, there are exceptions. Maybe people want a strong and stable government, which has the benefit of continuity. On the other hand, such a government can be accused of majoritarianism.I heard your prime minister, Oli-ji, mentioning frequent government changes. Obviously, how can the government function with this kind of instability? On the other hand there is the prime minister of India who has been elected for the third term. It is the people's choice, and you can't fault the people. The people chose stability and a strong government, and we have to respect that.Are people not knowledgeable enough to pick the right representatives for themselves?This question is often raised. For instance, we were talking about crorepatis and criminals in politics. Almost 46 percent of MPs in India have criminal cases against them. When we talk to these MPs, they say, look, people are choosing us, so how can you blame us? That way the blame is passed on to the people.Why is the electorate choosing dishonest people against whom there are criminal cases? This debate leads us nowhere. So obviously there is something good these people with criminal background must be doing in the constituency. Maybe they commit crime outside the constituency and like Robin Hood, benefit their own people.Aam Aadmi Party was a new party, and won 67 out of 70 seats in Delhi. They managed funds through crowdfunding and volunteers. And they won hands down.What are the issues that have come up with the proliferation of social media and new media?Social media and new media have revolutionised communication. But, initially, when the election commission of India in 2012 or 2013 came out with some regulation, there was a lot of public criticism, which was unjustified. Social media is also media. So whatever applies to media will apply to social media. And in the election context, what applies to the media? Two things: How much money are you spending on buying space in the newspaper and how much money are you paying to the TV channel?Therefore, how much money are you paying to Facebook or WhatsApp, you have to account for it as well. The law on expenditure will apply to social media also. The second concern was how will the election commission catch the violators, as they are anonymous. The difficulty in catching them cannot be an excuse for not taking cognisance of their offence. If we cannot catch them today, tomorrow we will. How can something be illegal in a newspaper and legal on social media?Rumours always play a big role in elections. Social media has multiplied the problem a thousand times. Within two, three minutes, your country can be burned by false, fake news. Social media however has many benefits. For instance, instead of buying space in the newspaper and TV channel, through WhatsApp or Twitter you can reach your audience in two seconds flat.So social media is a double-edged weapon, as was the consensus in the Kantipur Conclave. And, you know, it is like a knife. Is a knife good or bad? If you want to cut an apple, it is good. If you want to cut a man’s throat, it is bad. It depends how you use it. Now, artificial intelligence has given rise to even deep fakes. But AI has benefits too. Through artificial intelligence, impersonation can be stopped. Voting and logistics can be monitored. But there is so much fraud, deep fakes, and hate. So how do you catch them? That is something we have to be wary about. Frankly, I am worried because its dangers outweigh the benefits. We have to put our heads together globally to make sure artificial intelligence doesn’t overtake human intelligence for destructive ends.In Nepal, both federal and provincial elections happen at once. India too is now mulling ‘one nation, one election’. What is your take on this?There are benefits and there are problems. Logistically, it makes sense. But one MP of Odisha posed this question: ask the people. What do they want? Poor people love frequent elections because this is the only way they can highlight their importance. Otherwise, how many times have we seen that posters are put up in a constituency with headings like ‘Missing’, or ‘Wanted’ [representatives]? Frequent elections make the representatives accountable.We heard you say that if India does ‘one nation, one election’, that will be the presidential election. What do you mean?During parliamentary elections, there are national and international issues. The issues are different in Parliament [national], Vidhan Sabha [state-level] and Panchayat [local]. I would like to say that the local body elections are as important, perhaps more important because they’re closer to the people.India’s prime minister initially said that there would be a national debate and a consensus would be reached. There was a debate for 10 years, but there was no consensus.If there was no consensus, the idea should have been dropped. But the government decided unilaterally that we will go ahead and set up a committee led by the former president of India to suggest ways to implement ‘one nation, one election’. In my articles I have questioned the propriety of a former president being drawn into a government committee.They have made some questionable recommendations. They say that simultaneous will mean Vidhan Sabha and Lok Sabha, not Panchayat. But the terms of reference clearly say that simultaneous means all three tiers. Then it says Panchayat elections can be held after 100 days. After 100 days, there is a separate election. It’s a new election and will require totally different arrangements. These are also not simultaneous elections.  \nWeather in western Nepal has begun to change, with the Sudurpaschim province experiencing cloud cover since Monday evening.
