Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government and the main opposition Nepali Congress have reached an understanding on the terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary probe panel on the cooperatives scam. They came to an agreement during a meeting of the leaders of four major parties on Monday evening.Though three parties—the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party—had agreed to constitute a parliamentary committee on May 18 and formed a task force to draft the panel’s terms of reference (TOR), the task force struggled to finalise the terms due to conflicting stances of the ruling and opposition parties. Now the Rastriya Prajatantra Party has also come on board. While the party is not represented in the task force, it will have representation in the parliamentary probe committee. According to the members of the task force, with Monday’s understanding, the government will be able to present the annual budget on Tuesday. “We have agreed, in principle, on the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee,” said Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress. “The House will also resume Tuesday.”The understanding comes on the eve of the budget presentation day. Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun will present the annual budget for 2024-25 at a joint session of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. The main opposition Congress, which has been obstructing the House to put pressure on the government to form the parliamentary panel, had earlier threatened to obstruct budget presentation on Tuesday if the ruling parties continued to ignore its demand.“Some details of the TOR will be discussed and agreed on during a meeting tomorrow morning,” Sishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, who represents the party in the task force, told the Post.Jeevan Pariyar and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Nepali Congress; Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri and Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Khanal from the RSP are the members of the task force mandated to chart out the parliamentary committee’s terms of reference. According to Congress sources, there has been an agreement to form a seven-member parliamentary committee to look into the misuse of funds in several cooperatives including those based in Pokhara, Butwal and Bharatpur (Chitwan). The Nepali Congress has been accusing Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of obtaining loans illegally from three cooperatives based on these cities to fund his television channel, Gorkha Media Network, which is now defunct. “We are very close to an agreement that we will make it public tomorrow,” said Padam Giri, minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. “A meeting of the task force will sit tomorrow morning and give final touches to the ToR.”As agreed among the parties, the ToR will specifically mention the names of Surya Darshan Cooperatives of Kaski, Sahara Cooperatives of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperatives of Butwal, all of which have been linked to the home minister Lamichanne but are owned by GB Rai, who used to run the Gorkha Media Network.  “Then we will initiate a probe into the financial embezzlement in these cooperatives and a few others,” said a Nepali Congress leader. “Home Minister Lamichhane’s name will not be mentioned in the ToR. But the parties have agreed to probe financial embezzlement that took place in the Gorkha Media Network.” The home minister had reportedly drawn millions of rupees in loans from three cooperatives while he served as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network.Parties had agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives, and financial embezzlement in the three cooperatives, but the ruling parties emphatically rejected the opposition’s demand for inclusion of the home minister’s name in the TOR.Billions of rupees were illegally transferred from several cooperatives to fund the Gorkha Media Network. The funds were syphoned off by GB Rai, who used to run the three cooperatives based in Pokhara, Chitwan and Butwal and ran the now defunct Galaxy 4K television. “Although no names will be mentioned in the TOR,” said Giri, “if any financial foul play is discovered in the running of the Gorkha Media Network, legal action will be recommended for the culprit.” According to the Nepali Congress and UML’s leaders, the seven-member task force will initially be given at least three months to complete the investigation, subject to renewal if it cannot complete its task on time.As per the understanding, two members each from the Congress and the UML and one each from the CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party will be members of the parliamentary panel. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was active throughout Monday in order to find common ground and was busy meeting leaders from both ruling and opposition parties. In case there was no agreement, the Congress leaders had threatened to obstruct the house and disturb the finance minister’s budget presentation. It was the Congress that first raised the demand for the formation of the parliamentary committee after Rabi Lamichhane was appointed deputy prime minister and home minister on March 6. \nThe Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended the remand of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya by three days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.On Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own.On Saturday, police in Dhanusha interrogated Kashiraj Dahal, who was an administrative officer in the district 24 years ago, on the issue. During the interrogation, Dahal said the sign on Sirohiya’s citizenship copy was his own and was issued based on the original document.The extension of judicial custody comes despite national and international media organisations, rights bodies, business fraternity and leaders condemning the arrest. Protest programmes have been organised in various districts of Madhesh Province, including Dhanusha, demanding Sirohiya’s immediate release.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after Indrajit Mahato, a cadre of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.Sirohiya is currently undergoing treatment at the Janakpur-based Kavya Hospital following heart-related problems.Police arrested Sirohiya and started investigation stating that another person Shivaji Sahu Teli also has a citizenship certificate with the same number.Chief District Officer Ramuraj Kadariya and Superintendent of Police Bhuwaneshwar Tiwari have allegedly kept Teli, who ekes out a living as a rickshaw puller, under pressure. They have instructed him not to meet anyone or talk to them. The local administration has deployed some detectives to monitor Teli's activities.The investigation officers reached Teli’s residence and quizzed him a few days ago. He was also summoned to the District Police Office for inquiry.Earlier, the Post had made several attempts to meet Teli for reporting, but was unsuccessful. The Post was finally able to meet a panic-stricken Teli, along with his wife Pawandevi Sahu, on Monday.“Police have told me not to meet or talk to anyone. I am under stress. My health has worsened and I have been suffering from anxiety,” said Teli, an asthma patient. Teli said that in the past few days he had been unable to go to the city to operate his rickshaw.  \nThe construction of basic hospitals in 8 Achham local units, initiated in 2018, remains incomplete due to bureaucratic hurdles, lack of land availability, and construction company delays, leaving locals without access to better healthcare.\nThe floor of Parliament during the budget presentation has been a perennial battleground of Nepali politics.In recent years, the budget presentation has been chaotic including some instances of physical altercations. To announce the budget, the lawmakers have had to be controlled by marshals. And this drama may play out this year too.The ongoing feud between the ruling and opposition parties over forming a parliamentary inquiry committee on the misappropriation of cooperative savings may have spillover effects on the budget, which once again may be introduced through ordinances on Tuesday.Nepal’s economy, still reeling from the fallout of the pandemic and global geopolitics, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook due to frequent government changes, rampant corruption and irregularities, and the exodus of youths who see no future in the country.Many of the downside risks flagged by economists have begun to materialise.Experts say that aside from economic considerations, Nepal’s unstable national politics could also cause problems for the economy.Some key data released a few weeks ago confirm that Nepal’s construction and manufacturing sector is still in recession. The wholesale and retail sector has avoided the recession while tourism and agriculture have grown slightly. Economists say the country’s economy is doing badly. As industries are producing less, more people are going jobless. “If lawmakers give low or no priority to bringing the annual budget in the current situation, it will further drag down economic growth,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist.“What is happening currently is not healthy politics. In Parliament, the ongoing politics is more centred on individual interest.” “If political parties were serious about the country, the principles and priorities of the budget would have been discussed,” Adhikari said. “The budget would have been presented easily, well-discussed, reviewed and approved.”Even the policies and programmes were delayed and not even discussed, Adhikari said.Economists say that uncertain budget execution dashes hopes of the entire population. Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary probe on the misappropriation of cooperatives savings, particularly pointing the index finger at the incumbent Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, which the ruling alliance is reluctant to initiate. But this is not the first controversy related to corruption and irregularities that has marred ruling-opposition relations.Nepal’s economic reforms in the 1990s promised a liberal market-based economy, but even after three and a half decades, successive governments have shown little favour towards private businesses.“Crony capitalism distorts the efficiency of a free market. Yet Nepal is in the clutches of crony capitalism where limited people, families and communities benefit,” said Adhikari. Protecting them will only stir up power struggles in politics, bulldozing the hopes and aspirations of the people, he said. Economist Keshav Acharya said that when the budget comes under political pressure, nobody will take its ownership. Past experiences have shown that the budget undergoes numerous revisions with each new government coming to power. “The ongoing politics is weighing heavily on the economy. On the eve of the budget presentation, we are uncertain how it is coming. Will it be through ordinances or common consensus?” Acharya said. “Such uncertainty is not helpful when it comes to meeting the budget’s objectives.” Nepal's private sector contributes over 80 percent to the GDP, making it a crucial driver of economic growth. However, due to the fragile political system, investors have pulled back on investment.The annual spending of the three tiers of government stands at a combined Rs500 billion. The private sector pumps four times more into the national economy. Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, recently told a press conference that under the current investment model, the total investment amounts to Rs2.5 trillion. “At this investment rate, Nepal’s economic growth will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static.”He said that without encouraging private investment, Nepal will not be able to achieve double-digit economic growth. “We need to increase expenditure. We need to encourage the private sector to invest.”Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, said the private sector wants the bureaucracy and the policies to be stable. “Governments changing every six months will not be a problem if policies remain constant.”“The fiscal budget is a policy document to drive the economy. The private sector mainly looks for stable policies and their implementation.”The Nepali economy has historically been stuck in a low-growth trap in the past decades due to a decade-long Maoist insurgency followed by strikes, shutdowns, load-shedding, and earthquakes.Nepal in 2015 was struck by two powerful earthquakes of magnitudes 7.8 and 7.3 on April 25 and May 12, respectively, killing 8,790 people and injuring 22,300. The economic loss was estimated at $7 billion, out of which 76 percent was in the private sector.Following the disaster, Nepal’s economic growth rate plunged to 3.98 percent in the fiscal year 2014-15 and decelerated further to 0.43 percent in 2015-16.But since then, a flurry of post-disaster activities led to a breakneck speed of growth. The Nepali economy grew by 8.98 percent in the fiscal year 2016-17, the highest growth rate since the fiscal year 1993-94.In 2017-18, the economy grew by 7.62 percent and 6.66 percent in 2018-19, according to the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, the main government body that deals with the country's vital statistics.The worst came in 2019-20 when the world was hit by the Covid pandemic. The pandemic-induced supply and demand shock on the global economy caused Nepal's economy to plunge to a negative 2.37 percent.According to the World Bank, this was Nepal's first annual negative growth rate since 1982-1983, when its economic growth rate plummeted to -2.97 percent.The statistics office then attributed the negative growth rate to a drought in 1980-81, which in turn led to a severe food crisis.Nepal’s economy, which rebounded strongly after Covid, has been marred by political instability and haphazard decisions to gain short-term benefits, economists say.“There is politics everywhere, but that hardly affects most of the country’s economy. In Nepal, if the politics is unstable, the bureaucracy follows suit. That’s a bane for Nepalis and the economy,” said Acharya, the economist.  \nNepal’s cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane still has a chance to join Nepal’s squad in the United States and the West Indies for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup if he obtains a visa from the United States.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has submitted the list of only 14 players to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the World Cup, leaving one slot for leg spinner Lamichhane.All 20 participating teams had a May 25 deadline to submit their 15-man squad for the World Cup, including change in the provisional 15-member squad.“We have sent a list of only 14 players to the ICC for now because we still hope Lamichhane will get a visa from the US Embassy,” CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand told the Post.Last week, the US Embassy in Nepal denied a visa to Lamichhane which has jeopardised his hopes to participate in the World Cup.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments by the country’s cricket governing body, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.Nepal had already announced their provisional squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.“The ICC has already approved our request to include Lamichhane in the final 15-member World Cup squad,” Chand added. “If Lamichhane receives a visa in a few days, he will be included in the squad.”CAN will required approval from ICC’s event technical committee to make changes in Nepal’s squad.However, CAN has not yet revealed the name of the player who was not included in the list of the 14 players submitted to the ICC.If Lamichhane does not get a US visa, the 15 players currently in the team will play the World Cup, according to Chand.“We have requested the government to clarify the situation regarding Lamichhane to the US Embassy and make the environment favourable to Lamichhane,” Chand further said. “We hope he gets a visa because it is what our cricket fans want.”Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York, while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal government is presenting the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 in Parliament on Tuesday amid the crisis in the cooperative sector, which, according to the constitution, is one of the three economic pillars of the country.Instead of the market-driven economic policies that Nepal adopted after the Peoples’ Movement of 1990, the constitution promulgated in 2015 had adopted the three-pillar economic model acknowledging the role of public, private and cooperative sectors under the mixed economic system.Through the participation and development of the public, private and cooperative sectors, sustainable economic growth will be achieved with the maximum utilisation of available means and resources, the constitution states.However, due to the problems seen in cooperatives, one of the pillars of economic policy, the victims have taken to the streets, while the main opposition party Nepali Congress has been obstructing the parliament demanding an inquiry committee be constituted to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds.Considering the cooperative’s issues alone, the government is unlikely to reevaluate the three-pillar economic policy outlined in the constitution, experts say. They do, however, also believe that the government ought to put up a budget to deal with the problems that the cooperative victims and the entire cooperative sector are facing.This is the second budget to be brought by the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government formed after the elections held in November 2022. The previous budget was brought by the Congress-CPN (Maoist Centre) coalition government. The current budget will be brought by the CPN (UML)-Maoist Centre coalition government.Following the formation of the Dahal-led government, a series of scandals, including those involving Bhutanese refugees, gold, cooperatives, and the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, have rocked the country. Amid this, public dissatisfaction with the country’s political trajectory is growing as the government has been unable to resolve any issue rationally and the guilty are freed based on their political connections, experts say.Under these conditions, the general public has shown little enthusiasm for the upcoming budget.Ram Manandhar, a 49-year-old resident of Thamel, Kathmandu, says he is not particularly interested in the budget that will be unveiled on Tuesday.“After every budget presentation, we have been experiencing inflation in the market,” Manandhar, currently unemployed, told the Post. “I have no expectations from this budget except that the same circumstances won’t recur this time.”For a lack of enough opportunities within the country, youths are increasingly immigrating to foreign countries. In light of their mounting dissatisfaction, the government should have raised some hope in the youths through various policies and programmes, but this hasn’t been not the case. Gokul Ghimire, 25, of Malangwa in Sarlahi, is studying Japanese language in Kathmandu and looking forward to foreign employment in Japan. He contends that since the earlier budgets were unable to meet the aspirations of the younger generation, he is pessimistic that anything significant will occur this year.“The budget might attract the cadres of the political parties and interest groups who have a political nexus. Otherwise, individuals without political access seldom expect much from the budget,” Ghimire told the Post. “In a country where the leaders compete with one other to consolidate and maintain power rather than formulating policy, there is no reason to be enthusiastic about the impending budget.”Due to the rigidity of the ruling parties and opposition parties, regarding whether to constitute the parliamentary probe committee against Home Minister Lamichhane, the House has stalled for the last three months.The ongoing political crisis where the ruling parties and the opposition parties are adamant about implementing their agenda in national politics further aggravated the resentment of the youths, say experts.They say that because the country is at the peak of social despair, the government should bring a budget that addresses the problems of the youth.“Youths are frustrated due to continuous political chaos in the country. At such a time, the government should bring a youth-oriented and social welfare budget,” sociologist Meena Poudel told the Post. While the resentment towards politics is increasing among youths, the government is presenting the budget without the prior discussion of its policies and programmes in Parliament.Both chambers of the federal parliament on Sunday passed the government’s policies and programme for the next fiscal year amid protest from the Congress. Despite the Congress obstructing the House of Representatives, Speaker Devraj Ghimire conducted the discussion on the policies and programmes, which was later passed by a majority of lawmakers.There could be challenges in implementing the budget given that the policies and programmes have been passed without discussion in Parliament, say experts.“If the policies and programmes were discussed in the House, the government and the opposition could have put their opinion, due to which there would be room to include some topics that needed to be included in the budget,” economist Govinda Nepal told the Post. “Amid this, how the government will implement the budget, which has not even considered the opinion of the opposition, remains to be seen.” \nDeveloping infrastructure in remote parts of Nepal has historically been a neglected issue. Things were expected to improve after the introduction of the federal system. The new system came into full-fledged implementation after the first elections of federal, provincial and local units in 2017. One of the major objectives for adopting the federal system was to devolve powers to sub-national governments and strengthen them in terms of easing people’s daily lives, cutting red tape and taking state facilities closer to their doorsteps. After seven years of execution of the three-tier federal system, the sub-national authorities, however, couldn’t bring about expected improvement—bar some exceptions.Even now people in far-flung villages across the country are compelled to struggle for basic facilities. A recent report from our local correspondent in Panchthar narrates the plight of Hilihang villagers’s struggles for drinking water due to acute water shortage. People there have to make an hour-long journey to fetch water. On Monday, a report from Achham offered a glimpse of people’s struggle even to draw their social security allowances: the government provides certain amounts to single women, elderly and disabled on a monthly basis to help with their livelihoods. But folks in remote villages including those from the Turmakhand Rural Municipality have to trek for up to three days to reach the administrative centre of the rural municipality to collect their allowances. These representative cases show how people in Nepal’s villages are falling far behind in terms of enjoying even basic amenities.Nepal can’t develop without improving the status of its villages. Of the 753 local units, 460 are rural municipalities, 276 are municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan and six are metropolitan cities. This classification shows the vast majority of our local units are still poor in infrastructure. To lift the status of people in the villages, the first need is to ensure roads, telephone and internet connectivity, which are basic needs in this day and age—besides the all-important facilities like health, education and drinking waterElderly people in Turmakhand of Achham district need to trek for days to reach the municipality’s administrative centre to get their allowances. Often, the municipalities centralise most facilities at the administrative centres. In many local units, a ward now covers an area that used to be an entire village development committee (VDC), a local body before adoption of the federal system. So, in terms of providing basic services, wards should be developed as a base station and be better equipped, resourceful and efficient to accomplish basic tasks on their own.The local units too need to explore alternatives to help people get quick and efficient services. For instance, they can mobilise mobile government teams, comprising officials from all agencies concerned, to tour villages and provide allowances and other services periodically. This in turn calls for better planning and coordination among local administrations. Moreover, provincial governments and representatives need to work harder in terms of making service delivery more efficient as well. Such initiatives have become imperative to retain people in the fast-emptying villages across the country due to the increasing trend of internal as well as external migration.  \n“Harvard, do you hear us?” Shruthi Kumar, a graduating student, raised this poignant question during her off-script speech at the Harvard University Commencement on May 23. She furiously upbraided the elite school (like many other college campuses in the US) for trying to silence pro-Palestine voices on campus. Protesting against what many consider the excesses of this government on the owner of Kantipur Media Group, Kailash Sirohiya, I want to ask: Prime Minister, do you hear us?Whack one to silence allSadly, the crackdown on the KMG publisher on May 21, 2024, resembles the action of the then autocratic King Gyanendra Shah in early June 2001. Sirohiya, Editor-in-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire and director Binod Raj Gyawali were detained for nine days and charged with sedition after Kantipur Daily published Baburam Bhattarai’s article. Bhattarai was the principal ideologue of the armed Maoist insurgency—which was then raging across the country—led by none other than the incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.If Dahal still has any sense of honesty and morality left in him, he should feel humiliated to have the same KMG owner booked, king-style, on some flimsy allegations of acquiring fake or multiple citizenships decades ago. Even the monarchist forces hadn’t quite harassed and intimidated the publishing house and its chief executive like this. Most observers, including reputed international bodies like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Journalists, smell a rat in this incident. Although Sirohiya has been arrested ostensibly for allegedly falsifying his citizenship certificate, the real purpose seems to be to silence the criticism of the government’s important ministers and curb press freedom. The government appears to think that once you whack the main guy hard, all the group members will automatically fall in line. The amount of success this endeavour will gain is for the future to tell. However, the potential repercussions may outweigh its achievements. Defence of democracyIt is widely suspected that the arrest is more of a personal vengeance, of a nasty vendetta by the irritated rulers. KMG seems to have been punished by the authorities for conducting deep research on Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of large sums of funds from various cooperatives in many towns. This made KP Oli and Dahal uncomfortable as their defence for Lamichhane appeared increasingly untenable, which meant the coalition’s future became uncertain.I have nothing to do with personal tussles amongst people in power; Sirohiya, too, is not without access to power. Nevertheless, I am concerned by the latest developments because I greatly value press freedom. Independent media is a pillar of democracy. Democracy suffers damage once that independent space shrinks. It doesn’t matter whether one loves or hates KMG. I have my grievances against it and have publicly expressed some of them. I want it to be more inclusive and accommodating of diverse voices. It should do more to support the cause of lower classes, castes and neglected regions and religions. However, this is not the time, as some people are doing, to vilify and pour anger at KMG and discuss its weaknesses and limitations. This would only serve the purpose of the parties and leaders in power who are intent on sapping the freedom of expression for their own vested interests. I warn people against the coalition leadership’s potentially dangerous road towards greater intolerance and authoritarianism. I think the opposition’s—Nepali Congress party—assertion along this line is timely and appropriate. We need to be vigilant about the communists and the populists colluding to shrink the democratic space. Responsible citizens should always put their finger in the dyke. Demoralising businesses The rulers’ ultimate gain from this undue punishment of Nepal’s top media entrepreneur is unknown, but they have already alarmed the business community. This is particularly not good in a persistently failing economy. Lowering businesspeople’s morale is the last thing we need right now when small and medium businesses are rapidly shutting down and thousands of citizens are flying abroad to work in the sweatshops of Malaysia and the Gulf states every day to keep their families alive. Does this latest action encourage people to invest or divest from the country? Doesn’t the scandalous affair of harassing a long-established and esteemed businessman based on his citizenship potentially repel possible investors from non-resident Nepali (NRN) communities? Is the government aware of this potential fallout now and in the future? Offensive to Madheshis The government has not only arrested Kailash Sirohiya but also made a deliberate attempt to create a narrative that somehow he’s a potential foreigner illegally running media companies in Nepal. This has sent a wrong signal to the public and deeply offended the Madheshi community. Nepal is highly casteist and racist. People of the southern plains bear the brunt of hill racism. They are often seen as outsiders. This stems from a longstanding policy of the ruling elites over a long period. Hundreds of thousands of Madhesis, many of them Dalits, are not only landless but also stateless. They’ve been denied citizenship even after living in the country for many generations. Frustratingly, even those Madheshis who have lived here for long and significantly contributed to society, find their belonging to the land constantly questioned. If someone like Sirohiya, who owns the largest media house in the country, and has worked to restore democracy and human rights for decades, finds himself suspected as an illegal alien, can anyone imagine the plight of ordinary Madheshis? Isn’t this shameless behaviour of the Nepali state? Has the hill racism become worse in the republican era? Concerned leaders and their blind supporters may pretend not to know anything, but people are keenly watching. Such a racist attitude of the state expressed overtly or covertly, does not bode well for our peaceful and prosperous future. Today, social media is abuzz with highly critical and racist comments against Sirohiya. The smear campaign against him has peaked. Even some Dalits have criticised me for supporting whom they say is a member of the “media mafia”, of an “Indian agent”. This is deeply disturbing. To conclude, I don’t know Kailash Sirohiya personally, but I don’t need to know him. Nor do I declare him guilty or innocent of the charges; that’s for the judges to decide. In any case, my observations don’t change as my worry is only about the attack on press freedom for narrow political interests and the implicit racist attitude of the ruling elites. I’d be equally outraged if an owner, editor, or journalist of any other media corporation were similarly targeted. Sirohiya, mentioned in this article, is the publisher of the Post. The views expressed are the author’s own. \nDisasters disproportionately impact marginalized groups, with women being more vulnerable due to societal norms that restrict their access to resources and decision-making, making gender inequality the root cause of this vulnerability.\nIf you don’t have children, you are not necessarily infertile. Perhaps you don’t want one, for whatever reason. Yet the Nepali society continues to treat couples without children as odd, and somehow medically defective. And in a still highly patriarchal setup like Nepal’s, the blame for childlessness invariably falls on women. They get asked intrusive questions about their reproductive health. Often, men in such childless unions are asked to remarry so that they can have babies and take the family lineage forward. According to a 2020 study, Nepali couples are often put under pressure into having a child in the first year of their marriage, even when both husband and wife don’t want a baby. Even if one or the other member of a couple is infertile, another research in West Africa suggests, infertility in itself is not a cause for women’s anguish, it's also what is known as the Social Pressure for Pregnancy (SSP). Most women who failed to conceive cited external pressure from families and society as the main cause of their distress.As is the case in much of the world, the fertility rate in Nepal has been on a steady decline. For instance, in the two decades since 2002, there was a 50 percent dip in the country’s fertility rate. Greater awareness on family planning, increasing literacy and the rise in the number of families where both partners earn are responsible for this decline. So, again, many couples are not having children mostly out of choice. Yet women in particular continue to be under incredible social pressure to have babies, with women’s agency over their own bodies constantly undermined by their larger family and friend circles. Let’s face it, Nepal is still a men’s country where women and girls are routinely abused, verbally if not physically. When they face sexual assault, it becomes the women’s responsibility to establish guilt, even as the idea of consent is broadly defined in favour of the male perpetrator. There are far fewer women in decision-making roles, both in public and private sectors, again because of entrenched bias against women’s leadership qualities. It is hardly a surprise that whenever the chhaupadi huts are brought down in western Nepal, they come right back up. There could be no better example of society's attempt to control women, including their sexual and reproductive lives. Things are not so bad for women in urban parts of Nepal, but it is far from satisfactory. Women are expected to have more children, yet most organisations offer little in terms of maternity leave. It is good that the government is preparing to extend maternity leave to six months from the current provision of 14 weeks. Such progressive policies will help women better juggle work and family. They should also help Nepal avert the kind of sharp decline in population fast-ageing countries like Japan and China are now witnessing. But, at the end of the day, it is the women who should decide whether or not they want to have babies and how many. In a progressive society, they should get the environment to do so.   \nTemperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heatwave, the met office said on Monday.Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said.In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters.The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively.Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers.But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall.“The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,” Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town.”I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.”Close to Ali’s shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop’s shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business.Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water.“Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves.The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological DepartmentThe heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan’s largest city. \nToday's weather will remain generally cloudy with chances of rainfall throughout the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Madhesh and Karnali provinces along with the hilly regions of the country. The rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.The division said light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and one or two places in Madesh Province and Karnali Province. Light snowfall is possible at a few places in the eastern and central high mountainous regions. Tonight, light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning, and gusty winds is forecast in parts of Koshi province and the country's hilly area. Snowfall is expected in one or two high hilly and mountainous regions of Koshi Province tonight.Dhangadi recorded the highest temperature at 41.3 degrees Celsius while Jomsom experienced a minimum temperature of 12.0 degrees Celsius.  \nLast week, the Agriculture and Livestock Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City advised the general public to make sure that their bottled and jarred water is safe to drink. The warning was issued after municipal inspectors found algae and other particles in bottled water.“Our inspectors sent back bottled water delivery vehicles to their companies after finding issues with the water, containers, and labels,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, the chief of the department. “We will also inspect water in shops in the coming days.”The city office has no immediate plans to test the quality of water supplied to households by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, as the metropolis itself is responsible for that supply. Neupane said that his office will prioritise monitoring bottled and jar water first.Bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe. However, tests show the presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors say it is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved much.Other local units in the Valley said that they do not have the budget to regularly test the quality of water being supplied to households in their jurisdictions.“We had tested samples of drinking water collected from various sources in the past and found some problems,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “But all the budget allocated for water testing has already been used up. We can resume testing drinking water quality only after a new budget is allocated.”The Health Office Lalitpur tested the drinking water samples collected from ward 6 of Godawari Municipality in March and found them contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water used by locals of the Godawari ward is contaminated with sewage.The Lalitpur district includes the rural municipalities of Mahalaxmi, Godawari, Konjyoson, Bagmati, and Mahankal, along with Lalitpur Metropolitan City.The Nagarjun Municipality in Kathmandu also said that it does not have the budget to carry out quality testing of drinking water in the current fiscal year.“We had done water testing in the past with help from the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited,” said Krishna Bahadur Kunwar, an information officer of the municipality. “We can resume water testing only after we receive a new budget in the next fiscal year.”Although testing the drinking water used by the public is a regular responsibility of health agencies at the local level, most such agencies are unable to conduct regular testing due to insufficient budgets.Hospitals in the Valley have reported a surge in cases of diarrhoea and food poisoning recently, and contaminated water and food have been identified as the main causes. As the pre-monsoon rainfall has started, health workers say the risk of contamination has gone up.Doctors said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.Experts advise the public to ensure their water is safe for drinking. They say consuming contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera, but also increases the chances of contracting diseases like dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.According to them, launching awareness drives and ensuring access to safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases.  \nThe Supreme Court on Monday removed Gandaki Chief Minister Khagaraj Adhikari from his office, terming the vote of confidence he took in the first week of May unconstitutional.The court has ruled that the 30 votes the chief minister received were insufficient to win the trust vote, stating that 31 votes should be obtained to command a majority in the 60-member assembly.A division bench of Justices Kumar Regmi and Sunil Kumar Pokharel ordered the Gandaki Provincial head to appoint Nepali Congress provincial assembly leader Surendraraj Pandey as the new chief minister within 48 hours.The bench issued a mandamus order to appoint Pandey to the position as per the constitutional provision, which stipulates that the province head shall appoint the parliamentary party leader of the party with the highest number of members in the provincial assembly as the chief minister if the chief minister, appointed with the support of two or more parties, fails to win a trust vote within 30 days.Pandey had moved the court challenging the chief minister’s vote of confidence in the provincial assembly on May 5. He had also sought the apex court to issue an order to appoint him chief minister.During the floor test, the Speaker of the Gandaki provincial assembly had declared that Chief Minister Adhikari secured the trust vote. Amid protest from the opposition party, Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital announced that the votes obtained by the chief minister constituted a majority based on the Supreme Court’s recent ruling.The announcement triggered yet another controversy regarding the majority in the 60-strong provincial assembly. A total of 30 members voted in favour of Chief Minister Adhikari. The speaker then claimed that the number was sufficient to prove the majority. \nA writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Monday demanding suspension of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane from his position.The petition by advocate Anup Bhattarai also demands the annulment of the letter from the Office of the Attorney General that stated that there are no cases against Lamichhane in connection with the cooperative fraud.A hearing on the case has been scheduled for Wednesday.On May 22, the apex court directed its administration to register the petition.At Lamichhane’s request, the OAG on May 7 issued a letter in favour of Lamichhane, who also chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Advocate Bhattarai moved the top court to challenge the decision. However, the court administration had earlier refused to register the petition.Bhattarai went to the court against the decision. After a hearing, a single bench of Justice Tek Prasad Dhungana directed the court administration to register the petition.Bhattarai has demanded rulings from the top court to scrap the letter ‘which was issued without any legal basis’, direct the OAG not to issue such letters in the future and suspend Lamichhane from his position for the duration of the investigation on the cooperatives fraud. \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have yet again failed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed parliamentary panel to investigate the multi-billion-rupee cooperative scam.A meeting of the four-member panel led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri on Thursday could not agree on the ToR as they remain sharply divided on whether to mention the name of Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, in the ToR.The four-member panel was formed on May 18 after an agreement among the top leaders of the major parties to constitute the parliamentary committee to investigate the issue.As in the previous meetings, the Nepali Congress was firm on its demand that the investigation against Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the focus of the probe panel.The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party.“It is clear that investigation of cases, not an individual, should be the focus of the parliamentary committee. If some individuals are involved in misdeeds, they will automatically come under its scanner,” Mahesh Bartaula, CPN-UML chief whip who is also a member of the Giri-led panel, told the Post.“Our refusal to form a committee specifically to investigate Rabi Lamichhane is not about protecting him, but about avoiding setting a precedent of forming committees targeting an individual.”The ruling party leaders present in the meeting claimed that though no agreement was reached, the Congress had softened its stance during Thursday’s meeting compared to the past. Bartuala said they hope for a breakthrough on Friday.The meeting of the ToR drafting committee has been slated for 8:30 am on Friday, hours before the meeting of the House of Representatives. The Congress leaders, however, refuse to accept that they have softened their stance. They say the investigation against Lamichhane is their bottom line. “There has been no progress so far. However, we are open to discussions,” Ramesh Lekhak, the Congress chief whip, told the Post. “Let’s see what happens tomorrow [Friday].” In the meeting, the ruling party lawmakers had agreed to list out the names of the cooperatives which provided money to the Gorkha Media, for the investigation but without mentioning Lamichhane’s name. They had said they can list out Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan, Birgunj’s Sano Paila Cooperative and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation. However, they in return demanded that the probe committee be allowed to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. They want this as some cooperatives like Laligurans, which have been declared crisis-ridden, are owned by the Congress leaders.Ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being selective and unwilling to resolve the problems facing the cooperative sector in their entirety.As per a probable agenda for Friday’s House meeting, the government wants the programmes and policies to be endorsed after deliberations. In the past three meetings, the Speaker has been pushing ahead the House business using marshals to contain the protest by Congress lawmakers. Endorsement of the policies and programmes is necessary before presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. There is a constitutional obligation to present the budget on Tuesday.However, if the Congress continues its protest, the government may opt to bring the budget through ordinance instead of presenting budget-related bills in Parliament. “We want to present the budget in the House, but it all depends on whether the opposition parties will allow it,” said Bartaula. “Ordinance will be our last resort.”  \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has announced protests against the government, specifically targeting Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who faces charges of misuse of cooperative funds.“A joint meeting of the congress central working committee and parliamentary party on Wednesday decided to hold demonstrations starting Sunday demanding a parliamentary investigation against Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from credit cooperatives in Butwal, Pokhara and Chitwan,” said Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat after the meeting.The party has also instructed its sister organisations to organise protests against the “government’s protection of the cooperative fraudsters” starting Friday and expand these protests and demonstrations at the local level.“The way the home minister presented himself against Nepali Congress leaders and issued a veiled threat against some Congress leaders including General Secretary Gagan Thapa and others has made us serious,” an office bearer of the party told the Post.Over two dozen central working committee members as well as lawmakers spoke at the Wednesday meeting.“The government forced a confidence vote [in Parliament] by muzzling the main opposition and other opposition parties,” a statement issued by the party said. “It shows the government is trying to invite confrontation in the House, bypass the parliamentary process, evade questions, silence the opposition parties as well as the voices of cooperatives’ victims.”“On the one hand, the ruling parties have disrupted the process of discussions on crucial issues including policy corruption, people’s livelihoods, development plans and budgetary issues, plus lawmaking, and on the other hand they have also colluded to remain silent on several issues in which they are involved.”And outside Parliament, the government is trying to silence those who question it by putting pressure on and influencing them. Unconstitutional and undemocratic moves were made in the provinces through province heads, reads the statement. “We condemn such tendencies of the government. It is our conclusion that the government is becoming irresponsible, illiberal, arbitrary, undemocratic and totalitarian. Nepali Congress deplores such tendencies and has decided to oppose them resolutely in the federal parliament and provincial assemblies and out in the streets,” said the party’s statement. The Congress office bearer said that the home minister’s unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders was intolerable. “Time has come to show the party’s strength in the house as well as in the streets.”The party also took exception to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Kantipur Media Group (KMG), and concluded that it was an attempt to muzzle the Nepali press and threaten its very existence. A team of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Sirohiya from his office on the charge of forging citizenship documents. He is currently under judicial custody in Dhanusha, Janakpur.During the meeting, according to the multiple Nepali Congress leaders, several leaders and lawmakers demanded the resignation of the home minister, concluding that the government is increasingly marching on a totalitarian path. “Now onwards, the Congress should make the home minister’s resignation its single agenda and stand resolutely for it,” said a Congress office bearer. “Then the party should call for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane and should not stop its protest until the government agrees to its demand.”Although the major political parties were ready to form the parliamentary panel and also constituted a task force, disagreements over its terms of reference stalled the process. Congress spokesman Mahat said provincial and district committees of the party will announce their separate protest programmes against the government and home minister.“Until now, we have been calling for a parliamentary probe against the home minister. But this is no longer just about Rabi Lamichhane, as the alliance is trying to weaken the constitution. In such a situation, the Nepali Congress will not remain a bystander,” Mahat said after the meeting.The arrest of Kantipur Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was widely discussed in the meeting, and almost all central working committee members condemned it. The meeting also denounced the government’s attempts to muzzle the media and terrorise journalists. “We deplore such activities of the government and demand a free and fair environment for the media,” the party said in its statement.“The government is duping citizens, protecting criminals and attacking the constitution, democracy and democratic values, and it is headed towards authoritarianism. The meeting also called for justice for millions of cooperative victims, formation of a parliamentary probe committee against the home minister and urged the government to take action against those involved in the cooperative scam,” said Mahat.“The way the home administration presented itself while arresting Sirohiya from his own office was totally a vendetta,” said Mahat. “We deplore the arbitrary arrest, which was motivated by a series of news published by Kantipur in favour of the cooperative victims.”Besides criticising the role and activities of the home minister and the government, some lawmakers also came down hard on the role of Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Despite obstruction from the Nepali Congress, Speaker Ghimire had started the House session to allow the Prime Minister Dahal to seek a trust vote on Monday. “To ask for justice for 75,000 cooperative victims and in order to ensure the return of their deposits, the party has decided to voice its concerns in the street and in Parliament,” said Ajay Babu Siwakoti, a central working committee member. “We will expand such protests at the provincial and local levels.Besides Siwakoti, Nain Singh Mahar and several other central working committee members also were firm on their demand for the home minister’s resignation. “It is no longer a question of just probing the home minister. Now, he must resign,” said Mahar. He labelled the decision to arrest the KMG chairman as being motivated by “vendetta and revenge, which means the home minister no longer has any moral right to remain in the position.” “The way Sirohiya was arrested, the government was clearly intent on exacting revenge against him,” said Chanda Chaurhary. “The home minister used to say that he will put Sirohiya behind bars for at least a day and now he has got his wish.” “The citizenship issue is just a pretext to take revenge against him,” she added.Dila Sangraula termed the home minister’s statement in the House as ‘violent’ and ‘uncivilised’ and said he should resign. “Now the Nepali Congress should also raise the issue of Giribandhu tea estate land scam,” she said. According to the Supreme Court’s verdict, a cabinet decision of the then KP Oli government had allowed the estate owners to illegally swap a huge swath of estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa with a similar piece of lower-value land somewhere else in the district.Not only the Congress, another opposition party, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party also demanded a parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Lamichanne. A meeting of the party’s work execution committee on Wednesday called for a probe against the home minister, who is facing charges of using two passports and of being involved in misusing deposits of at least three cooperatives.The law should be equal for all, said Mohan Shrestha, party spokesperson. “The way a probe was launched against Sirohiya, a similar investigation should be initiated against home minister Lamichhane. The same law should apply to a common man and the minister,” said Shrestha. \nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Saturday dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Road Division Kathmandu office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work, Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media. Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The widening of the 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be carried out by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start from early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.Earlier, in January 2019, the Chinese government had handed over the 10.5 km eight-lane Koteshwar-Kalanki section of the Ring Road to the Nepal government.This is not the first time Mayor Shah has issued such a warning to the federal government and other state agencies.In April last year, the metropolis office stopped collecting garbage from Singha Durbar, the central secretariat of the federal government, and other VIP addresses such as the Office of the President at Sheetal Niwas and prime minister’s residence at Baluwatar. At the time, he had said that wasn’t a decision made on a whim but was rather a result of the “neglect, lack of responsibility and carelessness shown by the federal government”. \nAmid a rise in pre-monsoon rainfall activities, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have reported a surge in snakebites, fever, diarrhoea and jaundice cases.Doctors anticipate more cases of the ailments in the coming days, as the monsoon is about to start. This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nFinance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Sunday claimed that the county’s economic indicators are improving, despite the ongoing political turmoil gripping the country just two days before the budget presentation.The uncertainty surrounding the future of the government has unnerved the country's economy.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Sunday told Parliament that he prefers not to resort to issuing ordinances to bring the annual budget.Dahal’s comrade Pun told lawmakers that despite the contraction in the manufacturing and construction sectors, growth in agriculture and services would help the country’s economy grow.While presenting the Economic Survey for the current financial year 2023-24, Pun said the country would achieve growth of 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year ending mid-July, from 1.95 percent in the last fiscal year.The survey report, which is generally presented a few days before the budget day, is the government's analysis of the economy. It generally covers the economic activities of the first eight months of the current fiscal year.Pun attributed the growth rate to the performance of the agriculture sector, and tourism, which helped boost the accommodation and food services sector.According to Pun, agriculture output is estimated to grow by 3.05 percent, and the non-agriculture sector by 3.75 percent. In the last fiscal year, the agriculture sector grew by 2.76 percent and the non-agriculture sector by 2.13 percent. In the current fiscal year, paddy output has been projected to grow by 4.33 percent.The economic survey said that of the total population, 62 percent are involved in agriculture. However, the contribution of the farm sector to the gross domestic product (GDP) has been steadily dropping. The service sector's contribution is growing. In the current fiscal year, the sector's contribution to the national GDP has been projected at 62.9 percent, followed by agriculture at 24.09 percent and manufacturing at 13 percent. Consumption has been growing.The survey said that the contribution of consumption to the GDP had reached 92.4 percent, which means the ratio of savings to GDP is estimated to reach 7.6 percent.The survey said that slowing capital expenditure and credit disbursement have curtailed overall investment.According to the survey, the total investment by the private sector and the government has increased by a meagre 2.8 percent, to Rs1.74 trillion. Despite low investment and poor economic growth, Nepal's per capita income, however, has been growing. In the current fiscal year, the per capita national income is projected to grow to $1,456 from $1,405 in the last fiscal year. The per capita GDP, or the country's economic output per person, is calculated by dividing a country's GDP by its population. It has been projected to reach $1,434 in the current fiscal year, up from $1,389 in the last fiscal year. Finance Minister Pun claimed that inflation is under control. He said the government had kept inflation to 6.08 percent in the first eight months of the current fiscal year. It was 7.93 percent in the same period last fiscal year. The survey said that banking transactions through digital means and access to finance are rising due to the promotion of financial literacy.According to the survey, the number of mobile bank users reached 23.78 million in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, while there were 1.87 million internet banking users. Based on the branches of banks and financial institutions, including microfinance institutions, there are an average of 2,515 people per branch.The finance minister said the country's banking system has adequate liquidity, and interest rates are dropping. As of mid-March, the average interest rate on deposits was 6.74 percent, while interest on credit was 10.78 percent. In the same period last fiscal year, the interest rates on deposits and credits were 8.37 percent and 13.03 percent, respectively. Until mid-March or the first eight month period of the current fiscal year 2023-24, a total of 130,844 borrowers have benefited from concessional loans, amounting to Rs149.30 billion. Most of the loans were mobilised on commercial agriculture and livestock, amounting to Rs107 billion.The survey said that the capital market has recovered to an extent. Until mid-March, the Nepal Stock Exchange (Nepse) index reached 2,108.72 points, compared to 1953.06 points in mid-March 2023.The stock exchange's market capitalisation climbed to Rs3.31 trillion in the review period, up from Rs2.82 trillion in mid-March 2023. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, collection of insurance premiums increased by 4.4 percent, to Rs124.89 billion. Insurance coverage has reached 43.16 percent of the population, including Foreign Employment Term Life Insurance Policies.As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. In the review period, deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. The survey said that until mid-March, the number of Nepali workers receiving approval for foreign employment permits had reached 5.92 million since Nepal started issuing such permits in the mid-1990sThe number of people living below the poverty line has declined to 20.27 percent in 2023.

The national highway’s total length has reached 34,267 km. Of this, 53 percent has been blacktopped, 22.5 percent are gravel roads, and 24.3 percent are dirt roads.In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, 28 km of road have been added, 190 km of roads have been upgraded to gravel, and 189 km have been blacktopped.The survey said that the Investment Board Nepal, the Department of Industry, and Cottage and the Small Industry Development Board had approved Rs50.11 billion in investments as of mid-March.Similarly, as of mid-March, the foreign direct investment stock (the amount of money invested from abroad) in Nepal reached Rs478.85 billion. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, the government has approved foreign direct investment (FDI) worth Rs29.13 billion. Nepal received 1.01 million foreign tourists in 2023, up 65 percent from 2022. The average per capita spending of foreign tourists has been recorded at $41, while the average length of a tourist’s stay is 13.2 days, the survey said.However, there is a big gap between what Nepal earns from foreign tourists and the amount Nepalis spend abroad. Under the travel heading, the gap between travel income and expenses is Rs71.43 billion—Nepal spent more than it earned in the travel sector. The survey said Nepal is gradually moving toward becoming self-sufficient in energy. As of mid-March, 97.7 percent of the population had access to electricity, while the country's total electricity output had reached 3,060 MW. Climate change has become a burning issue.According to the survey, 90 percent of total crop losses are related to climate change, and climate change-induced losses range from 10 to 30 percent. The survey said that the National Food Security Storage and SAARC Food Security Store had reserves of 997 tonnes and 8,997 tonnes of food grain, respectively, in the review period.In the current fiscal year, the demand for chemical fertiliser is estimated to be around 600,000 tonnes.Out of the total demand, 360,000 tonnes are estimated to be for urea, 220,000 tonnes for DAP, and 20,000 tonnes for potash. In the review period, 270,600 tonnes of chemical fertilisers were imported and sold.The survey said the irrigation system was extended to an additional 1,640 hectares of land in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, reaching 88.5 percent of the total 1.76 million hectares of irrigable land. However, of Nepal's total arable 2.64 million hectares, irrigation coverage has reached 59 percent.In the review period, the survey said that 45.31 percent of Nepal’s total land is covered with forest, including bushes and buffer zones. Nepal has only 1.15 doctors and 2.54 hospital nurses for every 1,000 people.The total number of registered health workers, including doctors and nurses, in the country is 102,686. The total number of health institutions, including 215 hospitals, has reached 7,858.The survey said that as of mid-March, 35,143 people received free treatment for critical illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and kidney disease. Likewise, 2.39 million people are covered by life insurance. The survey said that 96.75 percent of the population has access to drinking water. However, only 27.76 percent have access to quality drinking water.Women's representation in government services, which was 12 percent a decade and a half ago, has reached 28.5 percent. The highest number of them are in health services, commanding a 49.7 percent share of the total employment.  \nDhorpatan hunting reserve, Nepal’s only game sanctuary, is back in business.The reserve, which saw diminished activity due to the Covid pandemic, has started to draw foreigners willing to pay millions of rupees to hunt blue sheep and Himalayan Tahr.Due to the rise in the number of licensed hunters, the reserve collected Rs40.48 million in revenue in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.Affluent hunters participate in the bid, which costs Rs1 million to Rs2 million for a hunting window in the alpine flat meadows of western Nepal.The pastures above 4,000m, locally known as patan, are home to blue sheep, Himalayan Tahr, and many other animals.Hunters, particularly those from the United States, Russia, Mexico, Spain and Germany, arrive in Nepal for the game. The reserve, established in 1987, is spread over 1,325 square kilometres.In 2022, the reserve also allowed Nepali citizens to hunt wild boars to boost domestic tourism in the area.The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation fixes hunting quotas effective for two seasons a year.Reserve officials said that revenue so far has been good, and if the trend continues, collections may reach a record-high by the end of the fiscal year in mid-July. The hunting reserve gathered Rs30.48 million in the last fiscal year.In the two seasons of the current fiscal year, 30 wild animals were hunted: 19 blue sheep and 11 Himalayan Tahr. The first hunting season closes in December and the second runs from mid-February to mid-April.According to the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, it earned Rs40.26 million by issuing permits in the last fiscal year. In addition, the reserve collected Rs1.16 million from tourists in entry charges and Rs900,000 for using wood and water inside the area. The reserve charged Rs57,000 for helicopter landing permits.In the fiscal year 2022-23, 7,645 tourists arrived in the reserve, which increased to 9,436 in the first ten months of the current fiscal.Hunting is permitted based on the quotas determined by conservationists. In the fiscal year 2021-22, 9,919 tourists visited the reserve, but the revenue amounted barely to Rs17.5 million. The hunting reserve collected a meagre revenue of Rs3.7 million in the Covid-19 pandemic fiscal year of 2019-20 and a more dismal Rs2 million in the fiscal year 2020-21. Revenue collection gradually picked up after the pandemic.With the increase in tourist numbers, activity in the park and its vicinity has also started rising. Local hotel owners have seen an expansion in business.The reserve is divided into six blocks for hunting purposes. Nearly a third of the reserve area is flat grassland. Another third comprises forests and hills, whereas the remaining area is a buffer zone.The reserve is home to 32 species of mammals and 130 bird species. According to the reserve office, there are around 852 Himalayan blue sheep and 200 Himalayan Tahrs in its forests. Snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, barking deer, spotted deer, red pandas, wild boar, and Himalayan goral, among other wildlife, are also found in the reserve, but their hunting is prohibited.Domestic tourists arrive at Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by vehicle via Burtibang of Baglung. In addition to the areas having a reserve office, domestic tourists also visit Jaljala and Niseldhor, while very few reach Buki, the alpine area of Nepal.Foreign tourists coming for hunting stay for 2 to 3 weeks and reach Fagune, Dhustung, Dogadi, Barse and Surtibang by helicopter.But illegal hunting has also thrived in the area.According to the statistics with the reserve, two sets of illegal weapons were seized on March 8 with the help of Nepal Army. On March 29, nine sets of weapons were captured. Joint teams of soldiers and conservationists have also been seizing animal hides.The seven blocks of the reserve cover Baglung, Myagdi, and Rukum districts, where the army's presence is limited.If security patrols are increased, revenue collection will rise, and illegal hunting will decline, said Binod Bikram Basnet, an army officer in the area. The office also lacks the required number of staff. \nThe Gandaki province has been projected to grow at 4.55 percent—the highest growth rate among all provinces—in the current fiscal year ending mid-July, according to the National Statistics Office.The office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, said in its national accounts estimates of all seven provinces released on Wednesday that most of the province's growth rate has been driven by accommodation and food services due to an increase in the number of foreign tourists. Followed by Gandaki, Lumbini province has been expected to achieve a growth of 4.05 percent this fiscal year.Bagmati province, which includes the Kathmandu Valley and remains the main economic hub of Nepal, is projected to witness a growth rate of 3.96 percent this fiscal year. The Bagmati province's share of the national GDP is estimated to be at 36.36 percent.According to the National Statistics Office, Nepal is expected to grow by 3.87 percent this fiscal year in the optimistic scenario with projected recovery of trade and robust tourism growth.Computed on the basis of this growth rate, Nepal’s gross domestic product (GDP) at the purchaser's price is estimated to reach Rs5.70 trillion at the end of the fiscal year in mid-July.The office’s growth estimate is slightly higher than the Asian Development Bank’s projection of 3.6 percent. The World Bank, on the other hand, has forecast a growth rate of 3.3 percent. The government’s initial target was to achieve a robust 6 percent growth.Of the total national output, Bagmati province is estimated to have the lion’s share of Rs2.07 trillion, or 36.36 percent.The Karnali province is the lowest contributor with its output accounting for Rs244 billion, or 4.28 percent of the total GDP.Koshi provinceThis province is expected to grow at 3.51 percent to Rs903 billion in the current fiscal year, ending mid-July 2024, the statistics office said.

However, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI)-weighted basis, are up 16.99 percent in mid-April, after rising by 14.07 percent in mid-March.“As Nepal is dependent on vegetable products from India like onion, potato, and lemon, as well as other green vegetables to fulfil the demand, certain changes in export policy by the Indian government affect the prices here,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetables Market Development Board.India restricted the export of onion for a few months and also introduced export duty and minimum export price and these drove up onion prices and contributed to inflation in this major kitchen staple, Shrestha said.The price of a kilo of onion nearly doubled to Rs200 in retail in the Nepali market from Rs120 per kilo after India’s export ban in December last year.Vegetable traders said that as the government imposed tax on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, as well as fruits and food items, it also contributed to vegetable inflation this year.Potatoes, onions and other daily consumable farm products are exempt from VAT under the Value Added Tax Act of 1996. But this fiscal year the government amended the law through the Financial Bill 2023, removing 170 goods from the tax-free list.Taxes totalling 23.5 percent are charged on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, fruits and food items—9 percent agriculture service charge, 1.5 percent advance tax and 13 percent VAT.The climate factor plays a major role in the production of vegetables as the agriculture system in the country is dependent on rainfall due to insufficient irrigation system, traders said.The less than average rainfall for a prolonged period impacted winter and rainy season vegetable production, Shrestha said.The price rise in other inputs like fertiliser, seeds, labour and agricultural equipment have also directly affected vegetable prices, Shrestha said. The price of all the agricultural inputs has increased in recent times, he said.Labour shortages in farm areas, especially in rural areas, have hit production as youths are leaving the country as migrant workers, severely impacting production, Shrestha said.The price of essential kitchen staples like tomato, potato and onion has increased within a month.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of local small tomatoes has increased by 62.63 percent within a month to Rs45 per kg on Tuesday, while Indian tomatoes saw an increase of 2.57 percent, and now costs Rs66.67 per kg. Also, the price of tomato small (tarai) has increased by 11.11 percent to Rs50 per kg. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has declined by 30.77 percent to Rs45 per kg.The wholesale price of potato red has increased by 14.54 percent within a month to Rs54.60 per kg while the price of potato (white) increased by 19.23 percent to Rs46.50 per kg. The price of potato red (Indian) has fallen marginally by 1.41 percent to Rs47 per kg.The wholesale price of onion dry (Indian) has increased by 22.65 percent to Rs83 per kg within a month.On May 4, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export tariff of $550 per tonne.The wholesale price of other vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, bottle gourd, squash, green vegetables, chilli, green coriander and garlic have gone up within a month.The wholesale price of cabbage increased by 22.44 percent to Rs40 per kg and cauliflower by 2.57 percent to Rs66.67 per kg within a month. Eggplant became dearer by 40 percent to Rs35 per kg in a month.Green peas became expensive by 100 percent to Rs170 per kg during the review period while bottle gourd price went up by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.Similarly, the price of squash increased by 20 percent to Rs30 per kg in a month. The price of green leafy vegetables like spinach and cress increased by 17.34 percent to Rs146.67 per kg within a month.The wholesale price of broccoli increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg.The wholesale price of chilli increased by 54.55 percent to Rs85 per kg while garlic dry (Nepali) price increased by 22.58 percent to Rs190 per kg within a month.Although it is the rainy season and peak vegetable season, prices have not dropped due to low rainfall, which has affected production, Shrestha said. Both the production and timely arrival of vegetables have suffered from lack of rain, leading to higher prices, he said.“Kalimati fruits and vegetable market used to receive 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily during this season in past years, but now we are receiving 600-700 tonnes. The imbalance between supply and demand has ultimately driven up prices,” Shrestha said. \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nOver 1,500 teen girls in Nepal have yet to receive their second HPV vaccine dose, despite a pilot program's launch in 2022 and its planned inclusion in the nation's regular vaccination schedule in 2025.\nStarting next Sunday, 1.46 million children in Nepal born between April 2016 and October 2018 will receive inactivated polio vaccine to address the risk of Type-2 polio infection despite Nepal being polio-free since 2010.\nIndia's West Nile virus outbreak prompts Nepal to assess risk due to high temperature, monsoon, vectors, and human mobility.\nPollution, primarily air pollutants, has led to a surge in respiratory illnesses and other health issues, reducing the life expectancy of Nepalese citizens by 5 years.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra founded his New York supper club 'The Sewing Tin', serving innovative Nepali-inspired dishes that blend traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques, showcasing Nepal's culinary heritage globally.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student, started baking during the 2020 lockdown and now runs the online baking shop Bakeleus, advocating for sustainable practices while experimenting to create unique baked goods.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a nutritious, self-sourced in Nepal, and have multiple health benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and protection against infections.\nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nKolkata Knight Riders lifted their third Indian Premier League (IPL) title with an eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in a lop-sided final in Chennai on Sunday.Kolkata, who topped the group stage of the 10-team league, had beaten Hyderabad in the first qualifier on Tuesday and were even more dominant in the summit clash, which lasted 29 overs.Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins was left to rue his decision to bat first as his side got skittled out for 113 runs in 18.3 overs.Player-of-the-match Mitchell Starc produced a double strike while his new ball partner Vaibhav Arora dismissed the dangerous Travis Head for a first ball duck to rattle Hyderabad.Kolkata’s talismanic all-rounder Andre Russell claimed three crucial wickets, including those of South African Aiden Markram and rival captain Cummins, as Hyderabad wilted inside 19 overs.Defending the lowest total in an IPL final, Cummins removed Sunil Narine in the second over but the miracle they needed did not materialise.Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed an unbeaten 52 off 26 balls, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39) helped Kolkata romp home in 10.3 overs in front of a sea of purple jerseys that included franchise co-owner and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.“No words to describe (the feeling). It means so much,” West Indies stalwart Russell said wiping away tears.“I am happy that all of us were very disciplined and worked towards one goal. This franchise has done a lot for me. It's a big gift from all of us to them.”It was a special night for Kolkata mentor Gautam Gambhir, who captained the franchise to IPL titles in 2012 and 2014.“I thought they (Kolkata) bowled fantastically. Obviously not enough (from Hyderabad) tonight... They didn’t give us anything,” Cummins said of his side’s batting effort.“It was a tricky wicket. I didn’t feel it was like a 200-plus wicket. I think 160 would have given us a chance.”Royal Challengers Bengaluru crashed out in the playoffs but stalwart Virat Kohli won the orange cap as the league’s leading scorer with 741 runs from 15 matches.Punjab Kings seamer Harshal Patel won the purple cap for the league’s most successful bowler with 24 wickets from 14 matches even though his team did not make the playoffs.Kolkata’s Narine was adjudged the season’s Most Valuable Player for his all-round brilliance. \nThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday said it has requested the prime minister and the foreign ministry to take initiatives to help Sandeep Lamichhane get a US visa.The Embassy of the United States of America in Nepal had denied visa to Lamichhane, who is preparing to travel to the country and the West Indies to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.Lamichhane took to social media to to say his visa application had been rejected.“And the US Embassy, Nepal did it again like they did back in 2019, they denied my visa for the T20 World Cup happening in the US and the West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well wishers of Nepal Cricket,” Lamichhane wrote.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments as the country’s cricket governing body lifted his suspension, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape conviction by a district court.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.The Kathmandu District Court on December 29, 2023 convicted Lamichhane of raping a girl and sentenced him to eight years in prison on January 11.He was cleared to play following the verdict.“We have already requested the prime minister, the foreign ministry and other stakeholders to take initiatives in getting Lamichhane a visa for the US,” Chatur Bahadur Chand, the CAN president, told the Post.“The visa was rejected despite the application being attached with the high court’s order and letters from the International Cricket Council and CAN,” Chand added.“It is a matter of concern for the country. But we are hopeful he will get a visa.”The US Embassy said they could not comment on individual visa cases.“The US Embassy is extremely excited to have Nepal's men’s national cricket team, the Rhinos, participating in the T20 World Cup in the United States and, in fact, a few Embassy officials met with them a few weeks ago to appreciate and encourage them before they headed out. We are wishing the entire team the best in the coming games,” the US Embassy said.“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”CAN has reached out to the ICC to include Lamichhane in Nepal’s T20 World Cup squad.Lamichhane has been training regularly at the TU Cricket Ground.It is not the first time the US has denied him a visa. Lamichhane’s visa application was rejected by the US in 2019 for the Caribbean Premier League. He had taken the issue to Twitter (now X) to express his dissatisfaction over the visa denial. However, a few hours after his post, the embassy had called Lamichhane and given him a visa.Nepal had already announced their provisional 15-man squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.The Nepali team are already in the West Indies and have been training in St Vincent. ICC allows all 20 participating teams of the global showpiece to make changes and submit their final squad until May 25.The Rhinos played a three-match T20 practice series against Windwards Volcanoes, which they won 2-1. They will play warm-up matches against Canada and the US on May 27 and May 30 before launching their World Cup campaign against the Netherlands on June 4.Nepal are making their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nThe Embassy of the United States of America in Kathmandu on Wednesday declined to issue a visa to national cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.The cricketer took to social media to say sorry to his fans.“The US Embassy did it again, as they did back in 2019. They denied my visa for the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well-wishers of Nepal cricket,” Lamichhane said in a post on X.In 2019, the embassy initially rejected his visa while the cricketer was planning to play in the Caribbean Premier League. However, the embassy had later granted him a visa at the time.The Cricket Association of Nepal had taken the initiative to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad after the Patan High Court acquitted him of rape.Nepal will begin their 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4.All other squad members have already reached the West Indies to participate in the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the US and the West Indies from June 1 to 29. In a response to the visa rejection, the embassy said it can’t comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup. We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law,” it said. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nAn Israeli airstrike killed at least 35 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, medics said, drawing condemnation from European leaders on Monday who urged implementation of a World Court ruling to halt Israel’s offensive.In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety shelters ablaze.Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.“The whole world is witnessing Rafah getting burnt up by Israel and no one is doing anything to stop it,” Bassam, a Rafah resident, said via a chat app, of the strike in an area of western Rafah that had been designated a safe zone.Despite a global outcry at the toll on civilians, Israeli tanks continued to bombard eastern and central areas of the city on Monday, killing eight, local health officials said.Israel’s military said Sunday’s air attack, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated militant group Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis.Earlier on Sunday, it had said eight rockets were intercepted after being fired from the Rafah area. A minister said that showed the need for continued operations against Hamas.Israel’s top military prosecutor, however, called the air strike “very grave” and said an investigation was underway.“The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) regrets any harm to non-combatants during the war,” Major-General Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi said at a conference on Monday.The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.Many of the dead were women and children, the health officials said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise as some were in critical condition with severe burns.Israel has kept up attacks on Rafah despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said.NO SAFE ZONEBy daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze.“The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said.“What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.”Hospitals in Rafah, including the International Committee of the Red Cross field hospital, were unable to handle all the wounded, so some were moved to hospitals in Khan Younis further north in Gaza for treatment, medics said.The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said the situation was horrifying. “Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that,” UNRWA wrote on X.Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.But it faces an international outcry.“On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,” Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said.Egypt condemned the Israeli military’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law.Saudi Arabia also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts. \nMore than 2,000 people were buried alive by a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea last week, the national disaster centre said on Monday, as treacherous terrain and the difficulty of getting aid to the site raises the risk few survivors will be found.The numbers of those buried around Yambali village in Enga province in the country’s north are based on estimates from local authorities which have been rising steadily since Friday’s landslide.A UN agency put the estimated death toll at more than 670 people on Sunday.The National Disaster Centre raised the toll again to 2,000 in a letter to the UN on Sunday that was released publicly on Monday. The landslide also caused major destruction to buildings and food gardens, it said.“The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike,” according to the letter.About 4,000 people were living near the affected area, CARE International PNG country director Justine McMahon told ABC television on Monday.But it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the local population as PNG’s last credible census was in 2000 and many people live in remote mountainous villages. The country recently announced a census would be conducted in 2024.The unstable terrain, remote location and nearby tribal warfare are hampering relief efforts in Papua New Guinea.Emergency crews, led by Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) defence personnel, were on the ground, but the first excavator only reached the site late on Sunday, according to a UN official.Social media footage posted by villagers and local media teams showed people scaling rocks, digging with shovels, sticks and their bare hands to find survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.Six bodies have been retrieved so far. The UN said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days.PNG media on Monday reported that residents had rescued a couple trapped under rubble after hearing their cries for help.Johnson and Jacklyn Yandam told local NBC News that they were very grateful and described their rescue as a miracle.“We thank God for saving our lives at that moment. We were certain that we were going to die but the big rocks didn’t crush us,” Jacklyn said. “It’s really hard to explain as we got trapped for nearly eight hours, then got rescued. We believe we were saved for a purpose.”About 1,250 people have been displaced by the landslide, which occurred in PNG’s Enga province early Friday. More than 150 houses were buried and about 250 houses abandoned.“The houses are buried under around eight metres (26.3 ft) of dirt. So there is quite a lot of debris to get through,” said CARE’s McMahon.DANGEROUS CONDITIONSWater continued to flow under the debris, the UN migration agency said, making it extremely dangerous for residents and the rescue team to clear debris.Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in PNG, told ABC television that emergency crews would continue to look for survivors until the residents asked them to stop.Aktoprak said that the rescue team had eight vehicles but that he hoped to receive additional resources soon.Tribal violence in the region has raised security concerns for road travel, with the military escorting convoys of rescue teams. Eight people were killed, and five shops and 30 houses burnt down on Saturday, the UN agency said.PNG gave arrest powers to its military in February amid an eruption of tribal violence that saw at least 26 men killed in an ambush.The landslide hit a section of highway near the Porgera gold mine, operated by Barrick Gold through Barrick Niugini Ltd, its joint venture with China’s Zijin Mining. Barrick has said the mine has enough fuel on site to operate for 40 days and other critical supplies for longer. \nStrong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of Bangladesh and India as severe cyclone Remal made landfall late on Sunday, leaving millions without electricity after power poles fell and some trees were uprooted by gusty winds.The storm crossed the coastal regions of Bangladesh’s Mongla port and the adjoining Sagar Islands in India’s West Bengal state with wind speed measuring up to 135 kmph, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The storm will gradually weaken into a cyclone during the morning on Monday and then move northeast and gradually weaken further, the IMD said in its latest weather update.The landfall process began around 9 pm local time in India on Sunday and continued for about five hours, the regional meteorological office in Kolkata said.One person was killed in the major metropolitan city of Kolkata when concrete chunks fell on him during the peak of the storm, police said. Roofs of thatched huts were blown away while mud houses were flattened in the coastal areas of both countries as authorities waited to ascertain the full scale of losses.The low-lying coasts of South Asian neighbours Bangladesh and India have experienced frequent severe storms in recent years as climate change forces a rise in sea surface temperatures. Remal is the year’s first cyclone in the region.Bangladesh moved about 800,000 people from the port areas of Mongla and Chittagong and nine coastal districts to storm shelters from Sunday morning. As many as 110,000 people were also taken to shelters in India.Dhaka set up nearly 8,000 cyclone shelters and mobilised 78,000 volunteers ahead of the storm while the Indian navy said it had kept ships, aircraft, divers and medical supplies on standby for deployment if required.While early warnings and timely evacuations helped both countries avert major casualties from the storm, there was a heavy toll on power infrastructure.Authorities in Bangladesh shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents while many coastal towns were left in the dark as fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, power ministry officials said.“We have no electricity since night, my mobile battery will run out anytime. By the grace of Allah, the cyclone was not as violent as we thought,” said Rahat Raja, a resident in the coastal district of Satkhira in Bangladesh.Reports of at least 356 uprooted electricity poles and damage to scores of transformers were received during the first hour of the landfall process, Arup Biswas, the minister for power in West Bengal government, said.More than 50 international and domestic flights had to be cancelled in Kolkata city as operations were suspended from Sunday noon. Bangladesh also suspended operations at Mongla and Chittagong ports.“Normal airport operations will resume from 9 am,” said C Pattavi, the director of the Kolkata airport, adding that the airport’s operational areas were clear from waterlogging.River embankments in the Sundarbans delta, the largest mangrove forest in the world, shared by India and Bangladesh, also suffered heavy damage with high tides breaching protective embankments at many places.Kolkata, like the state’s coastal belt, was also lashed by heavy rains with water logging in many areas, television footage showed. At least six trees were uprooted, which blocked roads, while there were also reports of wall collapses, police said.The cyclone also brought heavy rains to Bangladesh capital Dhaka, causing flooding of roads and severely impacting commuters. \nA Thai court on Monday sentenced opposition lawmaker Chonthicha Jangrew to two years in prison on Monday for insulting the monarchy, her lawyer said, over a speech she made three years ago at an anti-government protest.Chonthicha, 31, denies the charge of lese majeste and has been granted bail pending an appeal against the decision, lawyer Marisa Pidsaya told Reuters. The court had yet to issue a statement on the sentence.The law is one of the strictest of its kind in the world and seeks to protect Thailand's powerful monarchy from criticism, with prison terms of up to 15 years for each perceived insult.Chonthicha is currently a lawmaker for the popular opposition Move Forward Party, which has the most seats in parliament and is facing legal battles of its own over a previous plan to amend the royal insults law, which a court ordered it to drop from its manifesto.More than 272 people have been charged with insulting the monarchy since 2020, with 17 of those in jail in pre-trial detention, according to legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, which compiles data and had defended many of those prosecuted.Thai activist musician Chaiamorn Kaewwiboonpan was also sentenced to four years in jail on Monday for insulting the monarchy and violations of the computer crimes act, local media reported.The case stems from Chaiamorn burning a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in 2021, which he admitted to doing, but had argued it was not a violation of the royal insult law.Last year, courts sentenced Move Forward lawmaker Rukchanok Srinork to six years in prison over social media posts that criticised the monarchy.The ruling comes two weeks after activist Netiporn “Bung” Sanesangkhom died in prison, where she was being held in pre-trial detention on charges that include royal insult. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn our previous article, \"Regulatory gaps in Nepal’s fintech\" (March 14, 2024), we discussed some regulatory gaps in fintech. In this piece, we will focus on the regulatory gaps primarily related to cybersecurity and data protection that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must quickly address. The fintech ecosystem in Nepal is growing, but it remains fragile in terms of cybersecurity and data protection. The NRB regulation should promote fintech innovation while also considering the importance of data protection and security.Technology is evolving, and so are cyber-attacks. In 2019, hackers stole almost Rs18.9 million from 13 Nepali banks using ATM terminals. They spoofed the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Limited (NEPS) link using fake cards, which enabled them to take money from the ATMs by independently verifying all the information of the Nepal bank's clients. This incident was one of the most prominent cases of cross-banking transactions via ATM cash-out hack and could happen again. Hence, the NRB should be aware of such incidents. The court decided to punish the perpetrators; however, as it wasn’t physical loot, a detailed investigation to find out the root cause would have been an appropriate step by the central bank. Such investigations could provide insights and further strengthen the system security of such companies and bank and financial institutions in Nepal.Clause 44 of the Payment and Settlement Bylaw, 2077 (First Amendment, 2080) addresses the liability of the payment system operators (PSO)/payment service providers (PSP) in case of any disputes or any other loss arising from incidents such as cyber-attacks. However, the absence of explicit guidance regarding the extent of liability raises concerns. For instance, a PSO with a paid-up capital of Rs50 million must be given clear guidelines on their liability in the worst-case scenario, or there must be a limit on how much of their customers’ funds they can retain. Additionally, it is the right time to introduce a government guarantee fund, like the deposit and credit guarantee fund (DCGF), to protect the public from loss arising from data breaches and other cyber incidents. If the government had set up such funds, it would have been more vigilant and strict on cybersecurity measures. This would be a win-win situation for all parties.Furthermore, no insurance products are available in Nepal to hedge companies against any loss due to data breaches or similar security incidents. The lack of insurance coverage leaves companies vulnerable to hacking and losses. It might be appropriate for the regulator to open a pathway for companies in Nepal to obtain cyber insurance, even from foreign companies, until insurance companies in Nepal launch such products.Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw and Directive No. 3 of the NRB Unified Directive Related to Payment Systems, 2079, discusses the security policies and practices for PSO/PSP. Implementing a uniform requirement for payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27,000 certifications across all financial institutions involved in payment processing would ensure a data protection baseline, mitigating the risks of cyber threats. The language of the Directive is clear: A licensed institution shall adhere to the standards of PCI DSS, Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) Standard, EMV Contactless Standard, etc. However, a mechanism to ensure that these standards are followed is unclear. Had it been mentioned that certification like PCI DSS is mandatory, it would have made more sense since an independent third party always issues a certification. Similarly, regulatory requirements always act as the baseline for security, and these NRB guidelines are the minimum requirements spread across the industry. Further, data security is not a matter of securing them for a point of time only; it is a regular, ongoing activity that needs the attention of the stakeholders. Similarly, if we look through most payment-related companies’ websites, except for a few big players, we don’t find much information related to their security and related certifications.A provision requiring each licensed institution to disclose its licenses and certifications, commitment to data security, and other related matters on its website and update it regularly must be introduced to increase public awareness and invoke dialogues between the stakeholders. Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw contains a provision for system audit while it also mentions a provision for an annual system audit. In contrast, the Directive states that a system audit is mandatory after a year of operation and every two years when there are no changes in the existing system. These two provisions contradict each other, and the regulator must provide clarification on the same. Two years to conduct a system audit is pretty long, and so payment-related institutions must conduct at least an annual system audit in light of the rise of cyber threats in the present context.Awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity is a pressing need today since most occur due to human negligence. Social engineering is the most common way through which intruders can gather data and find loopholes in a payment system. To improve cyber risk measures, visibility is required on the organisation's risk dashboard, covering all inherent risk levels to provide a picture of what is being defended. Lastly, continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to risk management is the only way against cyber-attacks. The country’s payment industry is still in its infancy, and before something worse happens, all the stakeholders must join hands to protect the public’s interest. \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe emergence of a leader is possible through hard work, confidence, determination, ideas and identification with issues. Leaders are created by movements, long democratic practices and immediate events triggered by people’s frustration and anger. However, instant leaders are short-lived and fade away after they fail to imbibe perseverance, commitment and the qualities of being patient. Such leaders are soon seduced by power and privileges as their role is made for the time being. In Nepal, many ambitious youth have shown the characteristics of instant leaders who are easily exposed and stigmatised. Watching the Indian political scene for the last few years, it seems that it is the coming of age of Rahul Gandhi. Sooner or later, he will likely play a crucial role in Indian politics. Rahul’s rise is possible not because he happened to be a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family but because of his dedication, perseverance, hard work and the ability to be closer to the people of India. Rather than being elitist, he is perceived as people-centred and egalitarian in his mission and actions, contrary to his aristocratic family background. Rahul is evolving as a leader despite the humiliation and insinuation hurled at him by his opponents.His mission to unify India, accept unity in the diversity of Indian society and polity, and his steadfast commitment to safeguarding the Republican constitution by finding suitable guardrails have paid him rich dividends in recent elections. Whatever the results, he has surpassed all other country leaders, endearing himself to ordinary people. Born with a silver spoon, Rahul has unique personality traits. He has the knack of being humble; sometimes, he finds himself in ordinary train compartments, travelling with fellow travellers, shaving his beard in an ordinary salon in Rae Bareli, eating chhole-bhature in Delhi street, mixing with kids while undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra, or taking sweets in an ordinary shop somewhere in South India. These activities make him the darling of the masses. Narendra Damodar Modi, now the Prime Minister, by contrast, also has the humble background of being the son of a tea-seller at the Gujrat railway station and has emerged as a charismatic leader over time. Nevertheless, the taste of power that he enjoyed as a long-time chief minister of Gujrat and later as the country leader for over a decade seems to have transformed him into an elitist leader with a disposition for a luxurious life. However, Modi continues to be popular among his colleagues and has become the only star campaigner for his party during the three parliamentary elections in 2014, 2019 and 2024. Weary and exhausted, Modi’s charisma is declining due to his age and failure to deliver on the people’s basic needs. Moreover, India today is a highly polarised country, as the BJP government is criticised for using religion as a weapon to scare minorities, especially Muslims. The Hindutwa agenda is interpreted as the divisive doctrine propounded and practised by orthodox BJP leaders. Contrarily, Rahul has taken up this agenda, arguing that he wants to propagate love, not hatred, as he has been repeating since his long march from the deep South to Kashmir and Manipur to Maharastra. He has assured the people that he would not allow the constitution, which embraces the “unity in diversity” principle, to be destroyed. Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    \nNepal on Wednesday and Thursday held an international dialogue on climate issues of mountainous countries. Titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change,” it saw the participation of representatives from 23 countries gathered to strengthen coordination among mountain countries on climate change-related issues. The dialogue has been instrumental in positioning mountains at the centre of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On Thursday itself, 22 people from Madhesh reached Kathmandu after a 25-day walk, calling for saving the Chure mountains. They have come with a 12-point charter of demands, which include saving the water sources, jungles and mountains in the Chure region apart from protecting the land itself.One of the most fragile mountain ranges in South Asia, the Chure range consists of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. Around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long, the range is a lifeline for the Madhesh region, providing water, minerals and vegetation. However, the water sources originating from the foothills of Chure have dried up in recent years due to exploitation, leading to the depletion of the first layer of the underground water in the Bhawar and Madhesh regions. The depletion of water has already impacted people in Madhesh, with ponds, tube wells and hand pumps running dry.The culprits of the degradation of Chure are all too familiar: The sand, land and timber mafia that is only interested in making a profit and the three tiers of government that have no regard for the present and future of the nation and its citizens. But there has been little effort to stop the exploitation of the fragile mountains. As the Chure continues to turn into a desert, we are staring at a significant crisis of water and food scarcity.The President Chure-Tarai Madhes Conservation Area Programme has been making some significant interventions, especially related to water conservation, building ponds and irrigation channels. But these efforts have been too slow and inadequate considering the rapid deforestation and extraction in the region. The campaigners who have marched to Kathmandu say the foremost work the governments of all levels must do is to shut down the crusher and sand mining industries in the region. Moreover, they demand that the government declare Dilip Mahato, an activist who was killed by illegal sand miners, as the “First environmental martyr” of Nepal. What is significant about these campaigners is that they are not just activists speaking for an environmental cause, but victims of the impacts of environmental damage and face risks to their lives. The government must, therefore, listen to their demands and act to fulfil them.The campaigners for saving the Chure plan sit-ins at different places in Kathmandu—the common protest site at Maitighar as well as the offices of various political parties. The central government in Kathmandu, which is often too quick in manhandling protesters of all kinds, would do well to listen to the campaigners this time. They have come up with a message that is important not only for themselves but for the entire nation. The degradation of Chure impacts us all, and if we do not listen to the campaigners and act on time, we will be staring at a bleak future. \nAir pollution has plunged the world into a global public health crisis, and Nepal is no exception. The air we inhale for survival is one of the leading causes of illness, as reported by The Lancet, a medical journal. Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have become all too common now. Besides these, ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases, heart problems, and so on are attributed to bad air. The vulnerability of children, women, the elderly and underrepresented groups to air pollution adds to the urgency of its mitigation.The impact of toxic air is particularly harsh on Nepalis as our federal capital, Kathmandu, often tops the list of most polluted cities globally. Only a few weeks ago, Pokhara Metropolitan City’s air was unbreathable for several days. The southern plains met the same fate. This poor air quality has reduced our life expectancy by a staggering 4.6 years, as per the report by the Air Quality Life Index of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The situation is worse in nine southern districts (Mahottari, Rautahat, Dhanusha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha and Rupandehi). These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  \nNepal's Home Minister misused authority by arresting Kantipur Media Group chairman Kailash Sirohiya over alleged citizenship discrepancies in retaliation for critical reporting.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General expresses concern over global human rights backsliding, particularly in South Asia, citing shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, and impunity for past crimes in Nepal and Sri Lanka, highlighting the role of populism and economic inequality in fueling authoritarianism, and emphasizing the need for international cooperation on transitional justice and climate change.\nThe Unified Socialist, a splinter group of the CPN-UML, prepares for its first general convention amid poor electoral performance, lackluster service delivery, and ongoing leadership disputes with the Congress and the UML.\nDespite significant development progress, Nepal grapples with poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation, posing obstacles to LDC graduation and achieving SDGs.

Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government and the main opposition Nepali Congress have reached an understanding on the terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary probe panel on the cooperatives scam. They came to an agreement during a meeting of the leaders of four major parties on Monday evening.Though three parties—the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party—had agreed to constitute a parliamentary committee on May 18 and formed a task force to draft the panel’s terms of reference (TOR), the task force struggled to finalise the terms due to conflicting stances of the ruling and opposition parties. Now the Rastriya Prajatantra Party has also come on board. While the party is not represented in the task force, it will have representation in the parliamentary probe committee. According to the members of the task force, with Monday’s understanding, the government will be able to present the annual budget on Tuesday. “We have agreed, in principle, on the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee,” said Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress. “The House will also resume Tuesday.”The understanding comes on the eve of the budget presentation day. Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun will present the annual budget for 2024-25 at a joint session of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. The main opposition Congress, which has been obstructing the House to put pressure on the government to form the parliamentary panel, had earlier threatened to obstruct budget presentation on Tuesday if the ruling parties continued to ignore its demand.“Some details of the TOR will be discussed and agreed on during a meeting tomorrow morning,” Sishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, who represents the party in the task force, told the Post.Jeevan Pariyar and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Nepali Congress; Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri and Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Khanal from the RSP are the members of the task force mandated to chart out the parliamentary committee’s terms of reference. According to Congress sources, there has been an agreement to form a seven-member parliamentary committee to look into the misuse of funds in several cooperatives including those based in Pokhara, Butwal and Bharatpur (Chitwan). The Nepali Congress has been accusing Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of obtaining loans illegally from three cooperatives based on these cities to fund his television channel, Gorkha Media Network, which is now defunct. “We are very close to an agreement that we will make it public tomorrow,” said Padam Giri, minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. “A meeting of the task force will sit tomorrow morning and give final touches to the ToR.”As agreed among the parties, the ToR will specifically mention the names of Surya Darshan Cooperatives of Kaski, Sahara Cooperatives of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperatives of Butwal, all of which have been linked to the home minister Lamichanne but are owned by GB Rai, who used to run the Gorkha Media Network.  “Then we will initiate a probe into the financial embezzlement in these cooperatives and a few others,” said a Nepali Congress leader. “Home Minister Lamichhane’s name will not be mentioned in the ToR. But the parties have agreed to probe financial embezzlement that took place in the Gorkha Media Network.” The home minister had reportedly drawn millions of rupees in loans from three cooperatives while he served as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network.Parties had agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives, and financial embezzlement in the three cooperatives, but the ruling parties emphatically rejected the opposition’s demand for inclusion of the home minister’s name in the TOR.Billions of rupees were illegally transferred from several cooperatives to fund the Gorkha Media Network. The funds were syphoned off by GB Rai, who used to run the three cooperatives based in Pokhara, Chitwan and Butwal and ran the now defunct Galaxy 4K television. “Although no names will be mentioned in the TOR,” said Giri, “if any financial foul play is discovered in the running of the Gorkha Media Network, legal action will be recommended for the culprit.” According to the Nepali Congress and UML’s leaders, the seven-member task force will initially be given at least three months to complete the investigation, subject to renewal if it cannot complete its task on time.As per the understanding, two members each from the Congress and the UML and one each from the CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party will be members of the parliamentary panel. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was active throughout Monday in order to find common ground and was busy meeting leaders from both ruling and opposition parties. In case there was no agreement, the Congress leaders had threatened to obstruct the house and disturb the finance minister’s budget presentation. It was the Congress that first raised the demand for the formation of the parliamentary committee after Rabi Lamichhane was appointed deputy prime minister and home minister on March 6. \nThe Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended the remand of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya by three days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.On Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own.On Saturday, police in Dhanusha interrogated Kashiraj Dahal, who was an administrative officer in the district 24 years ago, on the issue. During the interrogation, Dahal said the sign on Sirohiya’s citizenship copy was his own and was issued based on the original document.The extension of judicial custody comes despite national and international media organisations, rights bodies, business fraternity and leaders condemning the arrest. Protest programmes have been organised in various districts of Madhesh Province, including Dhanusha, demanding Sirohiya’s immediate release.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after Indrajit Mahato, a cadre of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.Sirohiya is currently undergoing treatment at the Janakpur-based Kavya Hospital following heart-related problems.Police arrested Sirohiya and started investigation stating that another person Shivaji Sahu Teli also has a citizenship certificate with the same number.Chief District Officer Ramuraj Kadariya and Superintendent of Police Bhuwaneshwar Tiwari have allegedly kept Teli, who ekes out a living as a rickshaw puller, under pressure. They have instructed him not to meet anyone or talk to them. The local administration has deployed some detectives to monitor Teli's activities.The investigation officers reached Teli’s residence and quizzed him a few days ago. He was also summoned to the District Police Office for inquiry.Earlier, the Post had made several attempts to meet Teli for reporting, but was unsuccessful. The Post was finally able to meet a panic-stricken Teli, along with his wife Pawandevi Sahu, on Monday.“Police have told me not to meet or talk to anyone. I am under stress. My health has worsened and I have been suffering from anxiety,” said Teli, an asthma patient. Teli said that in the past few days he had been unable to go to the city to operate his rickshaw.  \nThe construction of basic hospitals in 8 Achham local units, initiated in 2018, remains incomplete due to bureaucratic hurdles, lack of land availability, and construction company delays, leaving locals without access to better healthcare.\nThe floor of Parliament during the budget presentation has been a perennial battleground of Nepali politics.In recent years, the budget presentation has been chaotic including some instances of physical altercations. To announce the budget, the lawmakers have had to be controlled by marshals. And this drama may play out this year too.The ongoing feud between the ruling and opposition parties over forming a parliamentary inquiry committee on the misappropriation of cooperative savings may have spillover effects on the budget, which once again may be introduced through ordinances on Tuesday.Nepal’s economy, still reeling from the fallout of the pandemic and global geopolitics, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook due to frequent government changes, rampant corruption and irregularities, and the exodus of youths who see no future in the country.Many of the downside risks flagged by economists have begun to materialise.Experts say that aside from economic considerations, Nepal’s unstable national politics could also cause problems for the economy.Some key data released a few weeks ago confirm that Nepal’s construction and manufacturing sector is still in recession. The wholesale and retail sector has avoided the recession while tourism and agriculture have grown slightly. Economists say the country’s economy is doing badly. As industries are producing less, more people are going jobless. “If lawmakers give low or no priority to bringing the annual budget in the current situation, it will further drag down economic growth,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist.“What is happening currently is not healthy politics. In Parliament, the ongoing politics is more centred on individual interest.” “If political parties were serious about the country, the principles and priorities of the budget would have been discussed,” Adhikari said. “The budget would have been presented easily, well-discussed, reviewed and approved.”Even the policies and programmes were delayed and not even discussed, Adhikari said.Economists say that uncertain budget execution dashes hopes of the entire population. Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary probe on the misappropriation of cooperatives savings, particularly pointing the index finger at the incumbent Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, which the ruling alliance is reluctant to initiate. But this is not the first controversy related to corruption and irregularities that has marred ruling-opposition relations.Nepal’s economic reforms in the 1990s promised a liberal market-based economy, but even after three and a half decades, successive governments have shown little favour towards private businesses.“Crony capitalism distorts the efficiency of a free market. Yet Nepal is in the clutches of crony capitalism where limited people, families and communities benefit,” said Adhikari. Protecting them will only stir up power struggles in politics, bulldozing the hopes and aspirations of the people, he said. Economist Keshav Acharya said that when the budget comes under political pressure, nobody will take its ownership. Past experiences have shown that the budget undergoes numerous revisions with each new government coming to power. “The ongoing politics is weighing heavily on the economy. On the eve of the budget presentation, we are uncertain how it is coming. Will it be through ordinances or common consensus?” Acharya said. “Such uncertainty is not helpful when it comes to meeting the budget’s objectives.” Nepal's private sector contributes over 80 percent to the GDP, making it a crucial driver of economic growth. However, due to the fragile political system, investors have pulled back on investment.The annual spending of the three tiers of government stands at a combined Rs500 billion. The private sector pumps four times more into the national economy. Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, recently told a press conference that under the current investment model, the total investment amounts to Rs2.5 trillion. “At this investment rate, Nepal’s economic growth will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static.”He said that without encouraging private investment, Nepal will not be able to achieve double-digit economic growth. “We need to increase expenditure. We need to encourage the private sector to invest.”Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, said the private sector wants the bureaucracy and the policies to be stable. “Governments changing every six months will not be a problem if policies remain constant.”“The fiscal budget is a policy document to drive the economy. The private sector mainly looks for stable policies and their implementation.”The Nepali economy has historically been stuck in a low-growth trap in the past decades due to a decade-long Maoist insurgency followed by strikes, shutdowns, load-shedding, and earthquakes.Nepal in 2015 was struck by two powerful earthquakes of magnitudes 7.8 and 7.3 on April 25 and May 12, respectively, killing 8,790 people and injuring 22,300. The economic loss was estimated at $7 billion, out of which 76 percent was in the private sector.Following the disaster, Nepal’s economic growth rate plunged to 3.98 percent in the fiscal year 2014-15 and decelerated further to 0.43 percent in 2015-16.But since then, a flurry of post-disaster activities led to a breakneck speed of growth. The Nepali economy grew by 8.98 percent in the fiscal year 2016-17, the highest growth rate since the fiscal year 1993-94.In 2017-18, the economy grew by 7.62 percent and 6.66 percent in 2018-19, according to the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, the main government body that deals with the country's vital statistics.The worst came in 2019-20 when the world was hit by the Covid pandemic. The pandemic-induced supply and demand shock on the global economy caused Nepal's economy to plunge to a negative 2.37 percent.According to the World Bank, this was Nepal's first annual negative growth rate since 1982-1983, when its economic growth rate plummeted to -2.97 percent.The statistics office then attributed the negative growth rate to a drought in 1980-81, which in turn led to a severe food crisis.Nepal’s economy, which rebounded strongly after Covid, has been marred by political instability and haphazard decisions to gain short-term benefits, economists say.“There is politics everywhere, but that hardly affects most of the country’s economy. In Nepal, if the politics is unstable, the bureaucracy follows suit. That’s a bane for Nepalis and the economy,” said Acharya, the economist.  \nNepal’s cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane still has a chance to join Nepal’s squad in the United States and the West Indies for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup if he obtains a visa from the United States.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has submitted the list of only 14 players to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the World Cup, leaving one slot for leg spinner Lamichhane.All 20 participating teams had a May 25 deadline to submit their 15-man squad for the World Cup, including change in the provisional 15-member squad.“We have sent a list of only 14 players to the ICC for now because we still hope Lamichhane will get a visa from the US Embassy,” CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand told the Post.Last week, the US Embassy in Nepal denied a visa to Lamichhane which has jeopardised his hopes to participate in the World Cup.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments by the country’s cricket governing body, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.Nepal had already announced their provisional squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.“The ICC has already approved our request to include Lamichhane in the final 15-member World Cup squad,” Chand added. “If Lamichhane receives a visa in a few days, he will be included in the squad.”CAN will required approval from ICC’s event technical committee to make changes in Nepal’s squad.However, CAN has not yet revealed the name of the player who was not included in the list of the 14 players submitted to the ICC.If Lamichhane does not get a US visa, the 15 players currently in the team will play the World Cup, according to Chand.“We have requested the government to clarify the situation regarding Lamichhane to the US Embassy and make the environment favourable to Lamichhane,” Chand further said. “We hope he gets a visa because it is what our cricket fans want.”Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York, while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal government is presenting the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25 in Parliament on Tuesday amid the crisis in the cooperative sector, which, according to the constitution, is one of the three economic pillars of the country.Instead of the market-driven economic policies that Nepal adopted after the Peoples’ Movement of 1990, the constitution promulgated in 2015 had adopted the three-pillar economic model acknowledging the role of public, private and cooperative sectors under the mixed economic system.Through the participation and development of the public, private and cooperative sectors, sustainable economic growth will be achieved with the maximum utilisation of available means and resources, the constitution states.However, due to the problems seen in cooperatives, one of the pillars of economic policy, the victims have taken to the streets, while the main opposition party Nepali Congress has been obstructing the parliament demanding an inquiry committee be constituted to probe Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the misappropriation of cooperatives funds.Considering the cooperative’s issues alone, the government is unlikely to reevaluate the three-pillar economic policy outlined in the constitution, experts say. They do, however, also believe that the government ought to put up a budget to deal with the problems that the cooperative victims and the entire cooperative sector are facing.This is the second budget to be brought by the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government formed after the elections held in November 2022. The previous budget was brought by the Congress-CPN (Maoist Centre) coalition government. The current budget will be brought by the CPN (UML)-Maoist Centre coalition government.Following the formation of the Dahal-led government, a series of scandals, including those involving Bhutanese refugees, gold, cooperatives, and the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate, have rocked the country. Amid this, public dissatisfaction with the country’s political trajectory is growing as the government has been unable to resolve any issue rationally and the guilty are freed based on their political connections, experts say.Under these conditions, the general public has shown little enthusiasm for the upcoming budget.Ram Manandhar, a 49-year-old resident of Thamel, Kathmandu, says he is not particularly interested in the budget that will be unveiled on Tuesday.“After every budget presentation, we have been experiencing inflation in the market,” Manandhar, currently unemployed, told the Post. “I have no expectations from this budget except that the same circumstances won’t recur this time.”For a lack of enough opportunities within the country, youths are increasingly immigrating to foreign countries. In light of their mounting dissatisfaction, the government should have raised some hope in the youths through various policies and programmes, but this hasn’t been not the case. Gokul Ghimire, 25, of Malangwa in Sarlahi, is studying Japanese language in Kathmandu and looking forward to foreign employment in Japan. He contends that since the earlier budgets were unable to meet the aspirations of the younger generation, he is pessimistic that anything significant will occur this year.“The budget might attract the cadres of the political parties and interest groups who have a political nexus. Otherwise, individuals without political access seldom expect much from the budget,” Ghimire told the Post. “In a country where the leaders compete with one other to consolidate and maintain power rather than formulating policy, there is no reason to be enthusiastic about the impending budget.”Due to the rigidity of the ruling parties and opposition parties, regarding whether to constitute the parliamentary probe committee against Home Minister Lamichhane, the House has stalled for the last three months.The ongoing political crisis where the ruling parties and the opposition parties are adamant about implementing their agenda in national politics further aggravated the resentment of the youths, say experts.They say that because the country is at the peak of social despair, the government should bring a budget that addresses the problems of the youth.“Youths are frustrated due to continuous political chaos in the country. At such a time, the government should bring a youth-oriented and social welfare budget,” sociologist Meena Poudel told the Post. While the resentment towards politics is increasing among youths, the government is presenting the budget without the prior discussion of its policies and programmes in Parliament.Both chambers of the federal parliament on Sunday passed the government’s policies and programme for the next fiscal year amid protest from the Congress. Despite the Congress obstructing the House of Representatives, Speaker Devraj Ghimire conducted the discussion on the policies and programmes, which was later passed by a majority of lawmakers.There could be challenges in implementing the budget given that the policies and programmes have been passed without discussion in Parliament, say experts.“If the policies and programmes were discussed in the House, the government and the opposition could have put their opinion, due to which there would be room to include some topics that needed to be included in the budget,” economist Govinda Nepal told the Post. “Amid this, how the government will implement the budget, which has not even considered the opinion of the opposition, remains to be seen.” \nDeveloping infrastructure in remote parts of Nepal has historically been a neglected issue. Things were expected to improve after the introduction of the federal system. The new system came into full-fledged implementation after the first elections of federal, provincial and local units in 2017. One of the major objectives for adopting the federal system was to devolve powers to sub-national governments and strengthen them in terms of easing people’s daily lives, cutting red tape and taking state facilities closer to their doorsteps. After seven years of execution of the three-tier federal system, the sub-national authorities, however, couldn’t bring about expected improvement—bar some exceptions.Even now people in far-flung villages across the country are compelled to struggle for basic facilities. A recent report from our local correspondent in Panchthar narrates the plight of Hilihang villagers’s struggles for drinking water due to acute water shortage. People there have to make an hour-long journey to fetch water. On Monday, a report from Achham offered a glimpse of people’s struggle even to draw their social security allowances: the government provides certain amounts to single women, elderly and disabled on a monthly basis to help with their livelihoods. But folks in remote villages including those from the Turmakhand Rural Municipality have to trek for up to three days to reach the administrative centre of the rural municipality to collect their allowances. These representative cases show how people in Nepal’s villages are falling far behind in terms of enjoying even basic amenities.Nepal can’t develop without improving the status of its villages. Of the 753 local units, 460 are rural municipalities, 276 are municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan and six are metropolitan cities. This classification shows the vast majority of our local units are still poor in infrastructure. To lift the status of people in the villages, the first need is to ensure roads, telephone and internet connectivity, which are basic needs in this day and age—besides the all-important facilities like health, education and drinking waterElderly people in Turmakhand of Achham district need to trek for days to reach the municipality’s administrative centre to get their allowances. Often, the municipalities centralise most facilities at the administrative centres. In many local units, a ward now covers an area that used to be an entire village development committee (VDC), a local body before adoption of the federal system. So, in terms of providing basic services, wards should be developed as a base station and be better equipped, resourceful and efficient to accomplish basic tasks on their own.The local units too need to explore alternatives to help people get quick and efficient services. For instance, they can mobilise mobile government teams, comprising officials from all agencies concerned, to tour villages and provide allowances and other services periodically. This in turn calls for better planning and coordination among local administrations. Moreover, provincial governments and representatives need to work harder in terms of making service delivery more efficient as well. Such initiatives have become imperative to retain people in the fast-emptying villages across the country due to the increasing trend of internal as well as external migration.  \n“Harvard, do you hear us?” Shruthi Kumar, a graduating student, raised this poignant question during her off-script speech at the Harvard University Commencement on May 23. She furiously upbraided the elite school (like many other college campuses in the US) for trying to silence pro-Palestine voices on campus. Protesting against what many consider the excesses of this government on the owner of Kantipur Media Group, Kailash Sirohiya, I want to ask: Prime Minister, do you hear us?Whack one to silence allSadly, the crackdown on the KMG publisher on May 21, 2024, resembles the action of the then autocratic King Gyanendra Shah in early June 2001. Sirohiya, Editor-in-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire and director Binod Raj Gyawali were detained for nine days and charged with sedition after Kantipur Daily published Baburam Bhattarai’s article. Bhattarai was the principal ideologue of the armed Maoist insurgency—which was then raging across the country—led by none other than the incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.If Dahal still has any sense of honesty and morality left in him, he should feel humiliated to have the same KMG owner booked, king-style, on some flimsy allegations of acquiring fake or multiple citizenships decades ago. Even the monarchist forces hadn’t quite harassed and intimidated the publishing house and its chief executive like this. Most observers, including reputed international bodies like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Journalists, smell a rat in this incident. Although Sirohiya has been arrested ostensibly for allegedly falsifying his citizenship certificate, the real purpose seems to be to silence the criticism of the government’s important ministers and curb press freedom. The government appears to think that once you whack the main guy hard, all the group members will automatically fall in line. The amount of success this endeavour will gain is for the future to tell. However, the potential repercussions may outweigh its achievements. Defence of democracyIt is widely suspected that the arrest is more of a personal vengeance, of a nasty vendetta by the irritated rulers. KMG seems to have been punished by the authorities for conducting deep research on Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of large sums of funds from various cooperatives in many towns. This made KP Oli and Dahal uncomfortable as their defence for Lamichhane appeared increasingly untenable, which meant the coalition’s future became uncertain.I have nothing to do with personal tussles amongst people in power; Sirohiya, too, is not without access to power. Nevertheless, I am concerned by the latest developments because I greatly value press freedom. Independent media is a pillar of democracy. Democracy suffers damage once that independent space shrinks. It doesn’t matter whether one loves or hates KMG. I have my grievances against it and have publicly expressed some of them. I want it to be more inclusive and accommodating of diverse voices. It should do more to support the cause of lower classes, castes and neglected regions and religions. However, this is not the time, as some people are doing, to vilify and pour anger at KMG and discuss its weaknesses and limitations. This would only serve the purpose of the parties and leaders in power who are intent on sapping the freedom of expression for their own vested interests. I warn people against the coalition leadership’s potentially dangerous road towards greater intolerance and authoritarianism. I think the opposition’s—Nepali Congress party—assertion along this line is timely and appropriate. We need to be vigilant about the communists and the populists colluding to shrink the democratic space. Responsible citizens should always put their finger in the dyke. Demoralising businesses The rulers’ ultimate gain from this undue punishment of Nepal’s top media entrepreneur is unknown, but they have already alarmed the business community. This is particularly not good in a persistently failing economy. Lowering businesspeople’s morale is the last thing we need right now when small and medium businesses are rapidly shutting down and thousands of citizens are flying abroad to work in the sweatshops of Malaysia and the Gulf states every day to keep their families alive. Does this latest action encourage people to invest or divest from the country? Doesn’t the scandalous affair of harassing a long-established and esteemed businessman based on his citizenship potentially repel possible investors from non-resident Nepali (NRN) communities? Is the government aware of this potential fallout now and in the future? Offensive to Madheshis The government has not only arrested Kailash Sirohiya but also made a deliberate attempt to create a narrative that somehow he’s a potential foreigner illegally running media companies in Nepal. This has sent a wrong signal to the public and deeply offended the Madheshi community. Nepal is highly casteist and racist. People of the southern plains bear the brunt of hill racism. They are often seen as outsiders. This stems from a longstanding policy of the ruling elites over a long period. Hundreds of thousands of Madhesis, many of them Dalits, are not only landless but also stateless. They’ve been denied citizenship even after living in the country for many generations. Frustratingly, even those Madheshis who have lived here for long and significantly contributed to society, find their belonging to the land constantly questioned. If someone like Sirohiya, who owns the largest media house in the country, and has worked to restore democracy and human rights for decades, finds himself suspected as an illegal alien, can anyone imagine the plight of ordinary Madheshis? Isn’t this shameless behaviour of the Nepali state? Has the hill racism become worse in the republican era? Concerned leaders and their blind supporters may pretend not to know anything, but people are keenly watching. Such a racist attitude of the state expressed overtly or covertly, does not bode well for our peaceful and prosperous future. Today, social media is abuzz with highly critical and racist comments against Sirohiya. The smear campaign against him has peaked. Even some Dalits have criticised me for supporting whom they say is a member of the “media mafia”, of an “Indian agent”. This is deeply disturbing. To conclude, I don’t know Kailash Sirohiya personally, but I don’t need to know him. Nor do I declare him guilty or innocent of the charges; that’s for the judges to decide. In any case, my observations don’t change as my worry is only about the attack on press freedom for narrow political interests and the implicit racist attitude of the ruling elites. I’d be equally outraged if an owner, editor, or journalist of any other media corporation were similarly targeted. Sirohiya, mentioned in this article, is the publisher of the Post. The views expressed are the author’s own. \nDisasters disproportionately impact marginalized groups, with women being more vulnerable due to societal norms that restrict their access to resources and decision-making, making gender inequality the root cause of this vulnerability.\nIf you don’t have children, you are not necessarily infertile. Perhaps you don’t want one, for whatever reason. Yet the Nepali society continues to treat couples without children as odd, and somehow medically defective. And in a still highly patriarchal setup like Nepal’s, the blame for childlessness invariably falls on women. They get asked intrusive questions about their reproductive health. Often, men in such childless unions are asked to remarry so that they can have babies and take the family lineage forward. According to a 2020 study, Nepali couples are often put under pressure into having a child in the first year of their marriage, even when both husband and wife don’t want a baby. Even if one or the other member of a couple is infertile, another research in West Africa suggests, infertility in itself is not a cause for women’s anguish, it's also what is known as the Social Pressure for Pregnancy (SSP). Most women who failed to conceive cited external pressure from families and society as the main cause of their distress.As is the case in much of the world, the fertility rate in Nepal has been on a steady decline. For instance, in the two decades since 2002, there was a 50 percent dip in the country’s fertility rate. Greater awareness on family planning, increasing literacy and the rise in the number of families where both partners earn are responsible for this decline. So, again, many couples are not having children mostly out of choice. Yet women in particular continue to be under incredible social pressure to have babies, with women’s agency over their own bodies constantly undermined by their larger family and friend circles. Let’s face it, Nepal is still a men’s country where women and girls are routinely abused, verbally if not physically. When they face sexual assault, it becomes the women’s responsibility to establish guilt, even as the idea of consent is broadly defined in favour of the male perpetrator. There are far fewer women in decision-making roles, both in public and private sectors, again because of entrenched bias against women’s leadership qualities. It is hardly a surprise that whenever the chhaupadi huts are brought down in western Nepal, they come right back up. There could be no better example of society's attempt to control women, including their sexual and reproductive lives. Things are not so bad for women in urban parts of Nepal, but it is far from satisfactory. Women are expected to have more children, yet most organisations offer little in terms of maternity leave. It is good that the government is preparing to extend maternity leave to six months from the current provision of 14 weeks. Such progressive policies will help women better juggle work and family. They should also help Nepal avert the kind of sharp decline in population fast-ageing countries like Japan and China are now witnessing. But, at the end of the day, it is the women who should decide whether or not they want to have babies and how many. In a progressive society, they should get the environment to do so.   \nTemperatures rose above 52 degrees Celsius (125.6 degrees Fahrenheit) in Pakistan’s southern province of Sindh, the highest reading of the summer and close to the country’s record high amid an ongoing heatwave, the met office said on Monday.Extreme temperatures throughout Asia over the past month were made worse most likely as a result of human-driven climate change, a team of international scientists have said.In Mohenjo Daro, a town in Sindh known for archaeological sites that date back to the Indus Valley Civilization built in 2500 BC, temperatures rose as high as 52.2 C (126 F) over the last 24 hours, a senior official of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, Shahid Abbas told Reuters.The reading is the highest of the summer so far, and approached the town's and country's record highs of 53.5 C (128.3 F) and 54 C (129.2 F) respectively.Mohenjo Daro is a small town that experiences extremely hot summers and mild winters, and low rainfall, but its limited markets, including bakeries, tea shops, mechanics, electronic repair shops, and fruit and vegetable sellers, are usually bustling with customers.But with the current heatwave, shops are seeing almost no footfall.“The customers are not coming to the restaurant because of extreme heat. I sit idle at the restaurant with these tables and chairs and without any customers,” Wajid Ali, 32, who owns a tea stall in the town.”I take baths several times a day which gives me a little relief. Also there is no power. The heat has made us very uneasy.”Close to Ali’s shop is an electronic repairs shop run by Abdul Khaliq, 30, who was sat working with the shop’s shutter half down to shield him from the sun. Khaliq also complained about the heat affecting business.Local doctor Mushtaq Ahmed added that the locals have adjusted to living in the extreme weather conditions and prefer staying indoors or near water.“Pakistan is the fifth most vulnerable country to the impact of climate change. We have witnessed above normal rains, floods,” Rubina Khursheed Alam, the prime minister’s coordinator on climate, said at a news conference on Friday adding that the government is running awareness campaigns due to the heatwaves.The highest temperature recorded in Pakistan was in 2017 when temperatures rose to 54 C (129.2 F) in the city of Turbat, located in the Southwestern province of Balochistan. This was the second hottest in Asia and fourth highest in the world, said Sardar Sarfaraz, Chief Meteorologist at the Pakistan Meteorological DepartmentThe heatwave will subside in Mohenjo Daro and surrounding areas, but another spell is expected to hit other areas in Sindh, including the capital, Karachi - Pakistan’s largest city. \nToday's weather will remain generally cloudy with chances of rainfall throughout the country.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has forecast generally cloudy weather in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Madhesh and Karnali provinces along with the hilly regions of the country. The rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair.The division said light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning and gusty wind is likely to occur at a few places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province and Gandaki Province and one or two places in Madesh Province and Karnali Province. Light snowfall is possible at a few places in the eastern and central high mountainous regions. Tonight, light to moderate rain with thunder, lightning, and gusty winds is forecast in parts of Koshi province and the country's hilly area. Snowfall is expected in one or two high hilly and mountainous regions of Koshi Province tonight.Dhangadi recorded the highest temperature at 41.3 degrees Celsius while Jomsom experienced a minimum temperature of 12.0 degrees Celsius.  \nLast week, the Agriculture and Livestock Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City advised the general public to make sure that their bottled and jarred water is safe to drink. The warning was issued after municipal inspectors found algae and other particles in bottled water.“Our inspectors sent back bottled water delivery vehicles to their companies after finding issues with the water, containers, and labels,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, the chief of the department. “We will also inspect water in shops in the coming days.”The city office has no immediate plans to test the quality of water supplied to households by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, as the metropolis itself is responsible for that supply. Neupane said that his office will prioritise monitoring bottled and jar water first.Bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe. However, tests show the presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors say it is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved much.Other local units in the Valley said that they do not have the budget to regularly test the quality of water being supplied to households in their jurisdictions.“We had tested samples of drinking water collected from various sources in the past and found some problems,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “But all the budget allocated for water testing has already been used up. We can resume testing drinking water quality only after a new budget is allocated.”The Health Office Lalitpur tested the drinking water samples collected from ward 6 of Godawari Municipality in March and found them contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water used by locals of the Godawari ward is contaminated with sewage.The Lalitpur district includes the rural municipalities of Mahalaxmi, Godawari, Konjyoson, Bagmati, and Mahankal, along with Lalitpur Metropolitan City.The Nagarjun Municipality in Kathmandu also said that it does not have the budget to carry out quality testing of drinking water in the current fiscal year.“We had done water testing in the past with help from the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited,” said Krishna Bahadur Kunwar, an information officer of the municipality. “We can resume water testing only after we receive a new budget in the next fiscal year.”Although testing the drinking water used by the public is a regular responsibility of health agencies at the local level, most such agencies are unable to conduct regular testing due to insufficient budgets.Hospitals in the Valley have reported a surge in cases of diarrhoea and food poisoning recently, and contaminated water and food have been identified as the main causes. As the pre-monsoon rainfall has started, health workers say the risk of contamination has gone up.Doctors said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.Experts advise the public to ensure their water is safe for drinking. They say consuming contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera, but also increases the chances of contracting diseases like dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.According to them, launching awareness drives and ensuring access to safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases.  \nThe Supreme Court on Monday removed Gandaki Chief Minister Khagaraj Adhikari from his office, terming the vote of confidence he took in the first week of May unconstitutional.The court has ruled that the 30 votes the chief minister received were insufficient to win the trust vote, stating that 31 votes should be obtained to command a majority in the 60-member assembly.A division bench of Justices Kumar Regmi and Sunil Kumar Pokharel ordered the Gandaki Provincial head to appoint Nepali Congress provincial assembly leader Surendraraj Pandey as the new chief minister within 48 hours.The bench issued a mandamus order to appoint Pandey to the position as per the constitutional provision, which stipulates that the province head shall appoint the parliamentary party leader of the party with the highest number of members in the provincial assembly as the chief minister if the chief minister, appointed with the support of two or more parties, fails to win a trust vote within 30 days.Pandey had moved the court challenging the chief minister’s vote of confidence in the provincial assembly on May 5. He had also sought the apex court to issue an order to appoint him chief minister.During the floor test, the Speaker of the Gandaki provincial assembly had declared that Chief Minister Adhikari secured the trust vote. Amid protest from the opposition party, Speaker Krishna Prasad Dhital announced that the votes obtained by the chief minister constituted a majority based on the Supreme Court’s recent ruling.The announcement triggered yet another controversy regarding the majority in the 60-strong provincial assembly. A total of 30 members voted in favour of Chief Minister Adhikari. The speaker then claimed that the number was sufficient to prove the majority. \nA writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court on Monday demanding suspension of Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane from his position.The petition by advocate Anup Bhattarai also demands the annulment of the letter from the Office of the Attorney General that stated that there are no cases against Lamichhane in connection with the cooperative fraud.A hearing on the case has been scheduled for Wednesday.On May 22, the apex court directed its administration to register the petition.At Lamichhane’s request, the OAG on May 7 issued a letter in favour of Lamichhane, who also chairs the Rastriya Swatantra Party. Advocate Bhattarai moved the top court to challenge the decision. However, the court administration had earlier refused to register the petition.Bhattarai went to the court against the decision. After a hearing, a single bench of Justice Tek Prasad Dhungana directed the court administration to register the petition.Bhattarai has demanded rulings from the top court to scrap the letter ‘which was issued without any legal basis’, direct the OAG not to issue such letters in the future and suspend Lamichhane from his position for the duration of the investigation on the cooperatives fraud. \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe ruling and opposition parties have yet again failed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed parliamentary panel to investigate the multi-billion-rupee cooperative scam.A meeting of the four-member panel led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri on Thursday could not agree on the ToR as they remain sharply divided on whether to mention the name of Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, in the ToR.The four-member panel was formed on May 18 after an agreement among the top leaders of the major parties to constitute the parliamentary committee to investigate the issue.As in the previous meetings, the Nepali Congress was firm on its demand that the investigation against Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the focus of the probe panel.The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party.“It is clear that investigation of cases, not an individual, should be the focus of the parliamentary committee. If some individuals are involved in misdeeds, they will automatically come under its scanner,” Mahesh Bartaula, CPN-UML chief whip who is also a member of the Giri-led panel, told the Post.“Our refusal to form a committee specifically to investigate Rabi Lamichhane is not about protecting him, but about avoiding setting a precedent of forming committees targeting an individual.”The ruling party leaders present in the meeting claimed that though no agreement was reached, the Congress had softened its stance during Thursday’s meeting compared to the past. Bartuala said they hope for a breakthrough on Friday.The meeting of the ToR drafting committee has been slated for 8:30 am on Friday, hours before the meeting of the House of Representatives. The Congress leaders, however, refuse to accept that they have softened their stance. They say the investigation against Lamichhane is their bottom line. “There has been no progress so far. However, we are open to discussions,” Ramesh Lekhak, the Congress chief whip, told the Post. “Let’s see what happens tomorrow [Friday].” In the meeting, the ruling party lawmakers had agreed to list out the names of the cooperatives which provided money to the Gorkha Media, for the investigation but without mentioning Lamichhane’s name. They had said they can list out Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan, Birgunj’s Sano Paila Cooperative and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation. However, they in return demanded that the probe committee be allowed to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. They want this as some cooperatives like Laligurans, which have been declared crisis-ridden, are owned by the Congress leaders.Ruling party leaders accuse the Congress of being selective and unwilling to resolve the problems facing the cooperative sector in their entirety.As per a probable agenda for Friday’s House meeting, the government wants the programmes and policies to be endorsed after deliberations. In the past three meetings, the Speaker has been pushing ahead the House business using marshals to contain the protest by Congress lawmakers. Endorsement of the policies and programmes is necessary before presenting the national budget for the upcoming fiscal year. There is a constitutional obligation to present the budget on Tuesday.However, if the Congress continues its protest, the government may opt to bring the budget through ordinance instead of presenting budget-related bills in Parliament. “We want to present the budget in the House, but it all depends on whether the opposition parties will allow it,” said Bartaula. “Ordinance will be our last resort.”  \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has announced protests against the government, specifically targeting Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who faces charges of misuse of cooperative funds.“A joint meeting of the congress central working committee and parliamentary party on Wednesday decided to hold demonstrations starting Sunday demanding a parliamentary investigation against Lamichhane, who is accused of embezzling millions of rupees from credit cooperatives in Butwal, Pokhara and Chitwan,” said Nepali Congress spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat after the meeting.The party has also instructed its sister organisations to organise protests against the “government’s protection of the cooperative fraudsters” starting Friday and expand these protests and demonstrations at the local level.“The way the home minister presented himself against Nepali Congress leaders and issued a veiled threat against some Congress leaders including General Secretary Gagan Thapa and others has made us serious,” an office bearer of the party told the Post.Over two dozen central working committee members as well as lawmakers spoke at the Wednesday meeting.“The government forced a confidence vote [in Parliament] by muzzling the main opposition and other opposition parties,” a statement issued by the party said. “It shows the government is trying to invite confrontation in the House, bypass the parliamentary process, evade questions, silence the opposition parties as well as the voices of cooperatives’ victims.”“On the one hand, the ruling parties have disrupted the process of discussions on crucial issues including policy corruption, people’s livelihoods, development plans and budgetary issues, plus lawmaking, and on the other hand they have also colluded to remain silent on several issues in which they are involved.”And outside Parliament, the government is trying to silence those who question it by putting pressure on and influencing them. Unconstitutional and undemocratic moves were made in the provinces through province heads, reads the statement. “We condemn such tendencies of the government. It is our conclusion that the government is becoming irresponsible, illiberal, arbitrary, undemocratic and totalitarian. Nepali Congress deplores such tendencies and has decided to oppose them resolutely in the federal parliament and provincial assemblies and out in the streets,” said the party’s statement. The Congress office bearer said that the home minister’s unsubstantiated accusations against Congress leaders was intolerable. “Time has come to show the party’s strength in the house as well as in the streets.”The party also took exception to the arrest of Kailash Sirohiya, chairman of the Kantipur Media Group (KMG), and concluded that it was an attempt to muzzle the Nepali press and threaten its very existence. A team of Nepal Police on Tuesday arrested Sirohiya from his office on the charge of forging citizenship documents. He is currently under judicial custody in Dhanusha, Janakpur.During the meeting, according to the multiple Nepali Congress leaders, several leaders and lawmakers demanded the resignation of the home minister, concluding that the government is increasingly marching on a totalitarian path. “Now onwards, the Congress should make the home minister’s resignation its single agenda and stand resolutely for it,” said a Congress office bearer. “Then the party should call for the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate Lamichhane and should not stop its protest until the government agrees to its demand.”Although the major political parties were ready to form the parliamentary panel and also constituted a task force, disagreements over its terms of reference stalled the process. Congress spokesman Mahat said provincial and district committees of the party will announce their separate protest programmes against the government and home minister.“Until now, we have been calling for a parliamentary probe against the home minister. But this is no longer just about Rabi Lamichhane, as the alliance is trying to weaken the constitution. In such a situation, the Nepali Congress will not remain a bystander,” Mahat said after the meeting.The arrest of Kantipur Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was widely discussed in the meeting, and almost all central working committee members condemned it. The meeting also denounced the government’s attempts to muzzle the media and terrorise journalists. “We deplore such activities of the government and demand a free and fair environment for the media,” the party said in its statement.“The government is duping citizens, protecting criminals and attacking the constitution, democracy and democratic values, and it is headed towards authoritarianism. The meeting also called for justice for millions of cooperative victims, formation of a parliamentary probe committee against the home minister and urged the government to take action against those involved in the cooperative scam,” said Mahat.“The way the home administration presented itself while arresting Sirohiya from his own office was totally a vendetta,” said Mahat. “We deplore the arbitrary arrest, which was motivated by a series of news published by Kantipur in favour of the cooperative victims.”Besides criticising the role and activities of the home minister and the government, some lawmakers also came down hard on the role of Speaker Devraj Ghimire. Despite obstruction from the Nepali Congress, Speaker Ghimire had started the House session to allow the Prime Minister Dahal to seek a trust vote on Monday. “To ask for justice for 75,000 cooperative victims and in order to ensure the return of their deposits, the party has decided to voice its concerns in the street and in Parliament,” said Ajay Babu Siwakoti, a central working committee member. “We will expand such protests at the provincial and local levels.Besides Siwakoti, Nain Singh Mahar and several other central working committee members also were firm on their demand for the home minister’s resignation. “It is no longer a question of just probing the home minister. Now, he must resign,” said Mahar. He labelled the decision to arrest the KMG chairman as being motivated by “vendetta and revenge, which means the home minister no longer has any moral right to remain in the position.” “The way Sirohiya was arrested, the government was clearly intent on exacting revenge against him,” said Chanda Chaurhary. “The home minister used to say that he will put Sirohiya behind bars for at least a day and now he has got his wish.” “The citizenship issue is just a pretext to take revenge against him,” she added.Dila Sangraula termed the home minister’s statement in the House as ‘violent’ and ‘uncivilised’ and said he should resign. “Now the Nepali Congress should also raise the issue of Giribandhu tea estate land scam,” she said. According to the Supreme Court’s verdict, a cabinet decision of the then KP Oli government had allowed the estate owners to illegally swap a huge swath of estate land in Birtamod, Jhapa with a similar piece of lower-value land somewhere else in the district.Not only the Congress, another opposition party, the Rastriya Prajatantra Party also demanded a parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Lamichanne. A meeting of the party’s work execution committee on Wednesday called for a probe against the home minister, who is facing charges of using two passports and of being involved in misusing deposits of at least three cooperatives.The law should be equal for all, said Mohan Shrestha, party spokesperson. “The way a probe was launched against Sirohiya, a similar investigation should be initiated against home minister Lamichhane. The same law should apply to a common man and the minister,” said Shrestha. \nThe ruling and opposition parties seem to be drifting further apart over the issue of investigating the cooperatives scam as leaders from the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and the Nepali Congress compete in making personal accusations against each other.A meeting of the top leaders of the major ruling and opposition parties on Saturday evening had in principle agreed to constitute a parliamentary panel to investigate the scam. As per their agreement, a four-member committee led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri, who also is a CPN-UML leader, was formed to finalise the terms of reference (ToR) for the parliamentary probe. The committee also includes Jeevan Pariyar from the Congress, Mahesh Bartaula of the UML, and Shishir Khanal of the RSP. However, marathon meetings by the Giri-led panel starting Sunday morning could not agree on the ToR as the ruling parties stuck to their guns. The main opposition insisted that the investigation against Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, in the capacity as then managing director of Gorkha Media Network, where the money from four different cooperatives was injected, should be the primary focus of the probe panel. The ruling parties on the other hand wanted a committee to probe the problems facing the entire cooperatives sector including those with links to Lamichhane—but without specifically naming the deputy prime minister, who also is the RSP chair.“We don’t want the committee just for the sake of forming one. It needs to investigate what we are pressing for,” said Ramesh Lekhak, Nepali Congress chief whip. “The ruling parties want a probe panel with a broader objective, without investigating the home minister.” The ruling party leaders, however, say the Congress wants to form the committee with the objective of implicating a particular person (Lamichhane). “The sole objective of the Congress is to target an individual, which is not acceptable. Their demand has nothing to do with resolving the problems in the cooperative sector but only with implicating the home minister,” said the UML’s Bartaula.RSP leaders say they were even flexible about including (Lamichhane-linked) Surya Darshan Cooperative of Pokhara, Sahara Cooperative of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperative of Butwal in the broader investigation, but only if the Congress agrees to allow the probe committee to dig up possible misuse of deposits in the cooperatives that have been declared crisis-ridden. “However, the Congress leaders didn’t agree. They backtracked from Saturday's agreement,” said the RSP’s Khanal. As the parties were in negotiations to finalise the ToR, a meeting of the House of Representatives called for 11 in the morning was postponed to 2 pm, which was again postponed to 4 pm. With no agreement in sight, the House meeting finally commenced at 6 in the evening with the single agenda of allowing Lamichhane to clarify the accusations against him.A meeting of the opposition parties held earlier in the morning had agreed to allow the home minister to answer questions raised against him, a chance he had long been asking for. The meeting called by the Congress was attended by the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party. The opposition parties, particularly the Congress, which had been barring Lamichhane from addressing the House and presenting bills, had agreed to allow him to clarify the matter. Addressing the House after more than two months, Lamichhane not only defended himself, but also launched a personal attacks on several Congress leaders. Daring anyone to present concrete evidence of fraud, he said, “I challenge anyone to show evidence that any decision was made to acquire a loan from cooperatives, that I submitted any loan applications or signatures during the loan process, or that any funds were deposited into my account during my tenure at Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd.” He claimed that fake loan statements were prepared in the cooperatives in his name, for which he is not responsible. “I haven’t signed any documents nor have I been on their boards or served in official capacity in any of the cooperatives. Never ever did the Gorkha Media decide to take loans from cooperatives,” he said. “I am not responsible to clear the filth created by [then Gorkha Media chair] GB Rai.” He said he has been hounded based on the sensational media headlines targeting him. Lamichhane also lashed out at the Nepali Congress, revealing that the party had offered him the prime ministerial position for a term of a year and a half. He questioned the party's moral stance, wondering why they considered him unfit for the role of home minister yet found him suitable for prime minister.“If I am ineligible to serve as home minister, with what moral justification do I assume the post of prime minister? I wish to raise this question in the House today. Is the offer for the prime ministerial position still valid, or has it lapsed?” said Lamichhane.He asked if the Congress was ready to constitute a probe panel against everyone the media has linked with corruption. Without naming Gagan Thapa, the Congress general secretary, Lamichhane accused him of selling the country's secret information to foreigners. Citing media reports, he also claimed that Thapa had embezzled millions of rupees in the name of constructing a park at Tri-Chandra College and had misused agricultural grants. He also asked whether the main opposition would want a probe panel against those who have been accused of grabbing the land of Bansbari Leather and Shoe Factory, illegally registering public land in Tikapur under individuals’ name, and stealing luxury watches, or selling diplomatic passports. “Not just those who hold two or three citizenship, the agents and assets of the foreigners who hold one citizenship and one passport but sell the country’s secret information must be ousted as the lawmaker,” he said.In response, the Congress leaders said Lamichhane was rattled by the demands to investigate him. Holding a press meet after the House meeting, Congress leader Thapa said not just Lamichhane but his larger team is also involved in the embezzlement of savings from cooperatives. “It seems they [Lamichhane and other RSP leaders] are trying their luck at running a political party having already operated cooperatives and a media company,” he said. Stating that such committees have been constituted in the past, Thapa said if Ram Sharan Mahat, Bharat Mohan Adhikari or Janardan Sharma can be investigated, why not Lamichhane. He also challenged the home minister to uncover any wrongdoing on his part. “If I am guilty, I need to face legal action. If he is guilty he has to go through the same process,” he said asking Lamichhane why he fears investigations.Thapa challenged the home minister to investigate his entire life, starting from his birth in Prasuti Griha [maternity hospital] in Kathmandu. “Look at the kinds of allegations he [Lamichhane] has levelled against me. I request him: Please form a committee to probe me… Such a committee to probe Gagan Thapa can be formed even within the RSP. Please do it.”Thapa said his party primarily wants an investigation into the embezzlement of money in the cooperatives with Lamichhane’s involvement as they believe that police have been barred from investigating them.“We are clear the House cannot function until a probe committee is formed as per our demand. The vote of trust motion will also not move ahead so long as the committee is not formed,\" said Thapa.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is preparing to take a vote of trust from the lower house on Monday. However, lack of agreement among the parties has put it into uncertainty. “We will try to agree on the ToR on Monday morning. Even if we can’t come to an agreement, the Congress should allow the vote on the trust motion as it is being done as per a constitutional obligation,” said Bartaula. \nThe widening rift between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to look into the cooperative scam has further complicated the parliamentary process at a time when the government has the compulsion to announce the fiscal budget on May 28. Despite multiple meetings and back-channel negotiations on Friday, the ruling and opposition parties failed to narrow down their differences over the formation of the parliamentary panel. Short of an understanding, meetings of both chambers of Parliament were put off until Sunday. While the National Assembly sitting was adjourned due to an obstruction by the main opposition, the House of Representatives meeting was deferred until Sunday through a notice.A senior Rastriya Swatantra Party leader told the Post that the House session was deferred by a day at the request of Nepali Congress leaders and informal talks between the Congress, the RSP and the prime minister were headed in the positive direction.“We do not want to derail the process of forming the parliamentary probe and we also do not want to introduce the budget through an ordinance,” the RSP leader who is engaged in multiple talks with leaders from ruling and opposition sides said. “We do not want to be seen as a destabilising factor.” A Nepali Congress office bearer told the Post that Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s decision to seek a vote of confidence on Monday has made them suspicious. The opposition leaders have smelt a rat after the government’s decision to withdraw the bill related to political parties and frequent changes of the conditions by the ruling parties on the parliamentary probe as well as the resumption of the house session to discuss the government’s policies and programmes and the budget presentation have created suspicion.“Now we are sensing that the government is set to bring the budget through an ordinance if our protest continues,” the Congress official said. The main opposition party is yet to decide whether to obstruct the House on Monday. Prime Minister Dahal has invited senior Nepali Congress leaders for a meeting on Saturday morning. The largest party convened a meeting of opposition parties on Friday. According to Gyanendra Shahi, chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party, the parties were one on forming a parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. “But we have also raised the issue that opposition parties should allow Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane to speak in the House and let him clarify his position.”Instead of taking the lead to resolve the deadlock in Parliament, the way the prime minister hurriedly seeks a vote of confidence has made the Nepali Congress suspicious. Prime Minister Dahal has decided to go for a floor test on Monday. He is seeking the vote of confidence of the House after the Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal on May 13 withdrew its support for the government following a split in the party.Some of the prime minister's recent activities did not help resolve the deadline inside the house, Nepali Congress general secretary Gagan Thapa said. The way the prime minister decided to hurriedly seek a vote of confidence and withdraw the bill related to the Political Party Act leads us to suspect that he wants to close the budget session of Parliament and present the budget through an ordinance.The prime minister's meeting with Congress leaders on Friday evening to discuss the latest political situation was deferred till Saturday morning.According to Thapa, the prime minister’s and the CPN-UML’s game plan will result in a loss for the Rastriya Swatantra Party.“Whatever the UML chair says for public consumption, his inner interest is different. The prime minister has his own interests. Finally, the Rastriya Swatantra Party will bear the brunt of these one after another conspiracy. I do not know how seriously the RSP is taking these developments, but if the UML and the Maoist Centre will try to go on a new course, the RSP stands to be impacted a lot,” said Thapa.Thapa said that his party’s position at the moment is to obstruct the House on Monday during the session in which the prime minister goes for a floor test.Suspicions are growing between the ruling and opposition parties over the issue of budget. If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, the ruling parties will go for the budget ordinance. It is up to the Nepali Congress, said Yogesh Bhattarai of the UML.If the Congress continues to obstruct the House, there is no option but to issue the budget through an ordinance.He added that they are hopeful of having positive talks and discussions with the Nepali Congress by Saturday.But the Nepali Congress is adamant on a probe against the home minister for his alleged involvement in Pokhara, Butwal, and Chitwan-based cooperatives. The parliamentary committee is needed to investigate the home minister, Congress spokesman Prakash Sharan Mahat said. Those who are in power and hold positions of authority should not be exempted from investigation.But the RSP has been refusing to form a committee targeting the home minister.“Why is the Nepali Congress only after three cooperatives at a time when 16 cooperatives are in crisis?” said Manish Jha of the RSP.The government has declared 20 cooperative firms as deeply crisis-ridden. The top managers of these cooperatives are either facing police charges or absconding.“Why are you only after three cooperatives?” Jha asked Congress leaders. “Though we cannot probe all 31,000 cooperatives, we can probe those in crisis.” Jha said that Congress leaders have no uniform opinions on how to resolve the cooperative crisis.“It’s been difficult for us to understand whose voice is authoritative in the Nepali Congress. The Congress office bearers have differing positions on forming the parliamentary committee and its terms of reference,” said Jha. “Who do we trust? We have urged the Nepali Congress leaders to come up with an official position on the party’s letterhead.” \nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Saturday dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Road Division Kathmandu office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work, Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media. Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The widening of the 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be carried out by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start from early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.Earlier, in January 2019, the Chinese government had handed over the 10.5 km eight-lane Koteshwar-Kalanki section of the Ring Road to the Nepal government.This is not the first time Mayor Shah has issued such a warning to the federal government and other state agencies.In April last year, the metropolis office stopped collecting garbage from Singha Durbar, the central secretariat of the federal government, and other VIP addresses such as the Office of the President at Sheetal Niwas and prime minister’s residence at Baluwatar. At the time, he had said that wasn’t a decision made on a whim but was rather a result of the “neglect, lack of responsibility and carelessness shown by the federal government”. \nAmid a rise in pre-monsoon rainfall activities, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have reported a surge in snakebites, fever, diarrhoea and jaundice cases.Doctors anticipate more cases of the ailments in the coming days, as the monsoon is about to start. This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nFinance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Sunday claimed that the county’s economic indicators are improving, despite the ongoing political turmoil gripping the country just two days before the budget presentation.The uncertainty surrounding the future of the government has unnerved the country's economy.Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal on Sunday told Parliament that he prefers not to resort to issuing ordinances to bring the annual budget.Dahal’s comrade Pun told lawmakers that despite the contraction in the manufacturing and construction sectors, growth in agriculture and services would help the country’s economy grow.While presenting the Economic Survey for the current financial year 2023-24, Pun said the country would achieve growth of 3.87 percent in the current fiscal year ending mid-July, from 1.95 percent in the last fiscal year.The survey report, which is generally presented a few days before the budget day, is the government's analysis of the economy. It generally covers the economic activities of the first eight months of the current fiscal year.Pun attributed the growth rate to the performance of the agriculture sector, and tourism, which helped boost the accommodation and food services sector.According to Pun, agriculture output is estimated to grow by 3.05 percent, and the non-agriculture sector by 3.75 percent. In the last fiscal year, the agriculture sector grew by 2.76 percent and the non-agriculture sector by 2.13 percent. In the current fiscal year, paddy output has been projected to grow by 4.33 percent.The economic survey said that of the total population, 62 percent are involved in agriculture. However, the contribution of the farm sector to the gross domestic product (GDP) has been steadily dropping. The service sector's contribution is growing. In the current fiscal year, the sector's contribution to the national GDP has been projected at 62.9 percent, followed by agriculture at 24.09 percent and manufacturing at 13 percent. Consumption has been growing.The survey said that the contribution of consumption to the GDP had reached 92.4 percent, which means the ratio of savings to GDP is estimated to reach 7.6 percent.The survey said that slowing capital expenditure and credit disbursement have curtailed overall investment.According to the survey, the total investment by the private sector and the government has increased by a meagre 2.8 percent, to Rs1.74 trillion. Despite low investment and poor economic growth, Nepal's per capita income, however, has been growing. In the current fiscal year, the per capita national income is projected to grow to $1,456 from $1,405 in the last fiscal year. The per capita GDP, or the country's economic output per person, is calculated by dividing a country's GDP by its population. It has been projected to reach $1,434 in the current fiscal year, up from $1,389 in the last fiscal year. Finance Minister Pun claimed that inflation is under control. He said the government had kept inflation to 6.08 percent in the first eight months of the current fiscal year. It was 7.93 percent in the same period last fiscal year. The survey said that banking transactions through digital means and access to finance are rising due to the promotion of financial literacy.According to the survey, the number of mobile bank users reached 23.78 million in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, while there were 1.87 million internet banking users. Based on the branches of banks and financial institutions, including microfinance institutions, there are an average of 2,515 people per branch.The finance minister said the country's banking system has adequate liquidity, and interest rates are dropping. As of mid-March, the average interest rate on deposits was 6.74 percent, while interest on credit was 10.78 percent. In the same period last fiscal year, the interest rates on deposits and credits were 8.37 percent and 13.03 percent, respectively. Until mid-March or the first eight month period of the current fiscal year 2023-24, a total of 130,844 borrowers have benefited from concessional loans, amounting to Rs149.30 billion. Most of the loans were mobilised on commercial agriculture and livestock, amounting to Rs107 billion.The survey said that the capital market has recovered to an extent. Until mid-March, the Nepal Stock Exchange (Nepse) index reached 2,108.72 points, compared to 1953.06 points in mid-March 2023.The stock exchange's market capitalisation climbed to Rs3.31 trillion in the review period, up from Rs2.82 trillion in mid-March 2023. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, collection of insurance premiums increased by 4.4 percent, to Rs124.89 billion. Insurance coverage has reached 43.16 percent of the population, including Foreign Employment Term Life Insurance Policies.As of mid-March, there are 31,450 cooperatives in Nepal, with 7.38 million members. In the review period, deposit mobilisation in cooperatives amounted to Rs478 billion, while credit mobilisation stood at Rs405 billion. The survey said that until mid-March, the number of Nepali workers receiving approval for foreign employment permits had reached 5.92 million since Nepal started issuing such permits in the mid-1990sThe number of people living below the poverty line has declined to 20.27 percent in 2023. In 2011, this was over 25 percent. According to the survey, 24.66 percent of the poor live in rural areas, and 18.34 percent are in urban areas. The survey said 1.19 million Nepalis were enrolled in the government's social security fund as of mid-March, and the number of institutions listed in the fund had reached 18,755. The national highway’s total length has reached 34,267 km. Of this, 53 percent has been blacktopped, 22.5 percent are gravel roads, and 24.3 percent are dirt roads.In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, 28 km of road have been added, 190 km of roads have been upgraded to gravel, and 189 km have been blacktopped.The survey said that the Investment Board Nepal, the Department of Industry, and Cottage and the Small Industry Development Board had approved Rs50.11 billion in investments as of mid-March.Similarly, as of mid-March, the foreign direct investment stock (the amount of money invested from abroad) in Nepal reached Rs478.85 billion. In the first eight months of the current fiscal year, the government has approved foreign direct investment (FDI) worth Rs29.13 billion. Nepal received 1.01 million foreign tourists in 2023, up 65 percent from 2022. The average per capita spending of foreign tourists has been recorded at $41, while the average length of a tourist’s stay is 13.2 days, the survey said.However, there is a big gap between what Nepal earns from foreign tourists and the amount Nepalis spend abroad. Under the travel heading, the gap between travel income and expenses is Rs71.43 billion—Nepal spent more than it earned in the travel sector. The survey said Nepal is gradually moving toward becoming self-sufficient in energy. As of mid-March, 97.7 percent of the population had access to electricity, while the country's total electricity output had reached 3,060 MW. Climate change has become a burning issue.According to the survey, 90 percent of total crop losses are related to climate change, and climate change-induced losses range from 10 to 30 percent. The survey said that the National Food Security Storage and SAARC Food Security Store had reserves of 997 tonnes and 8,997 tonnes of food grain, respectively, in the review period.In the current fiscal year, the demand for chemical fertiliser is estimated to be around 600,000 tonnes.Out of the total demand, 360,000 tonnes are estimated to be for urea, 220,000 tonnes for DAP, and 20,000 tonnes for potash. In the review period, 270,600 tonnes of chemical fertilisers were imported and sold.The survey said the irrigation system was extended to an additional 1,640 hectares of land in the first eight months of the current fiscal year, reaching 88.5 percent of the total 1.76 million hectares of irrigable land. However, of Nepal's total arable 2.64 million hectares, irrigation coverage has reached 59 percent.In the review period, the survey said that 45.31 percent of Nepal’s total land is covered with forest, including bushes and buffer zones. Nepal has only 1.15 doctors and 2.54 hospital nurses for every 1,000 people.The total number of registered health workers, including doctors and nurses, in the country is 102,686. The total number of health institutions, including 215 hospitals, has reached 7,858.The survey said that as of mid-March, 35,143 people received free treatment for critical illnesses like cancer, heart disease, and kidney disease. Likewise, 2.39 million people are covered by life insurance. The survey said that 96.75 percent of the population has access to drinking water. However, only 27.76 percent have access to quality drinking water.Women's representation in government services, which was 12 percent a decade and a half ago, has reached 28.5 percent. The highest number of them are in health services, commanding a 49.7 percent share of the total employment.  \nDhorpatan hunting reserve, Nepal’s only game sanctuary, is back in business.The reserve, which saw diminished activity due to the Covid pandemic, has started to draw foreigners willing to pay millions of rupees to hunt blue sheep and Himalayan Tahr.Due to the rise in the number of licensed hunters, the reserve collected Rs40.48 million in revenue in the first ten months of the current fiscal year.Affluent hunters participate in the bid, which costs Rs1 million to Rs2 million for a hunting window in the alpine flat meadows of western Nepal.The pastures above 4,000m, locally known as patan, are home to blue sheep, Himalayan Tahr, and many other animals.Hunters, particularly those from the United States, Russia, Mexico, Spain and Germany, arrive in Nepal for the game. The reserve, established in 1987, is spread over 1,325 square kilometres.In 2022, the reserve also allowed Nepali citizens to hunt wild boars to boost domestic tourism in the area.The Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation fixes hunting quotas effective for two seasons a year.Reserve officials said that revenue so far has been good, and if the trend continues, collections may reach a record-high by the end of the fiscal year in mid-July. The hunting reserve gathered Rs30.48 million in the last fiscal year.In the two seasons of the current fiscal year, 30 wild animals were hunted: 19 blue sheep and 11 Himalayan Tahr. The first hunting season closes in December and the second runs from mid-February to mid-April.According to the Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve, it earned Rs40.26 million by issuing permits in the last fiscal year. In addition, the reserve collected Rs1.16 million from tourists in entry charges and Rs900,000 for using wood and water inside the area. The reserve charged Rs57,000 for helicopter landing permits.In the fiscal year 2022-23, 7,645 tourists arrived in the reserve, which increased to 9,436 in the first ten months of the current fiscal.Hunting is permitted based on the quotas determined by conservationists. In the fiscal year 2021-22, 9,919 tourists visited the reserve, but the revenue amounted barely to Rs17.5 million. The hunting reserve collected a meagre revenue of Rs3.7 million in the Covid-19 pandemic fiscal year of 2019-20 and a more dismal Rs2 million in the fiscal year 2020-21. Revenue collection gradually picked up after the pandemic.With the increase in tourist numbers, activity in the park and its vicinity has also started rising. Local hotel owners have seen an expansion in business.The reserve is divided into six blocks for hunting purposes. Nearly a third of the reserve area is flat grassland. Another third comprises forests and hills, whereas the remaining area is a buffer zone.The reserve is home to 32 species of mammals and 130 bird species. According to the reserve office, there are around 852 Himalayan blue sheep and 200 Himalayan Tahrs in its forests. Snow leopard, Himalayan black bear, barking deer, spotted deer, red pandas, wild boar, and Himalayan goral, among other wildlife, are also found in the reserve, but their hunting is prohibited.Domestic tourists arrive at Dhorpatan Hunting Reserve by vehicle via Burtibang of Baglung. In addition to the areas having a reserve office, domestic tourists also visit Jaljala and Niseldhor, while very few reach Buki, the alpine area of Nepal.Foreign tourists coming for hunting stay for 2 to 3 weeks and reach Fagune, Dhustung, Dogadi, Barse and Surtibang by helicopter.But illegal hunting has also thrived in the area.According to the statistics with the reserve, two sets of illegal weapons were seized on March 8 with the help of Nepal Army. On March 29, nine sets of weapons were captured. Joint teams of soldiers and conservationists have also been seizing animal hides.The seven blocks of the reserve cover Baglung, Myagdi, and Rukum districts, where the army's presence is limited.If security patrols are increased, revenue collection will rise, and illegal hunting will decline, said Binod Bikram Basnet, an army officer in the area. The office also lacks the required number of staff. \nThe Gandaki province has been projected to grow at 4.55 percent—the highest growth rate among all provinces—in the current fiscal year ending mid-July, according to the National Statistics Office.The office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, said in its national accounts estimates of all seven provinces released on Wednesday that most of the province's growth rate has been driven by accommodation and food services due to an increase in the number of foreign tourists. Followed by Gandaki, Lumbini province has been expected to achieve a growth of 4.05 percent this fiscal year.Bagmati province, which includes the Kathmandu Valley and remains the main economic hub of Nepal, is projected to witness a growth rate of 3.96 percent this fiscal year.

However, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index (CPI)-weighted basis, are up 16.99 percent in mid-April, after rising by 14.07 percent in mid-March.“As Nepal is dependent on vegetable products from India like onion, potato, and lemon, as well as other green vegetables to fulfil the demand, certain changes in export policy by the Indian government affect the prices here,” said Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetables Market Development Board.India restricted the export of onion for a few months and also introduced export duty and minimum export price and these drove up onion prices and contributed to inflation in this major kitchen staple, Shrestha said.The price of a kilo of onion nearly doubled to Rs200 in retail in the Nepali market from Rs120 per kilo after India’s export ban in December last year.Vegetable traders said that as the government imposed tax on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, as well as fruits and food items, it also contributed to vegetable inflation this year.Potatoes, onions and other daily consumable farm products are exempt from VAT under the Value Added Tax Act of 1996. But this fiscal year the government amended the law through the Financial Bill 2023, removing 170 goods from the tax-free list.Taxes totalling 23.5 percent are charged on potatoes, onions and other vegetables, fruits and food items—9 percent agriculture service charge, 1.5 percent advance tax and 13 percent VAT.The climate factor plays a major role in the production of vegetables as the agriculture system in the country is dependent on rainfall due to insufficient irrigation system, traders said.The less than average rainfall for a prolonged period impacted winter and rainy season vegetable production, Shrestha said.The price rise in other inputs like fertiliser, seeds, labour and agricultural equipment have also directly affected vegetable prices, Shrestha said. The price of all the agricultural inputs has increased in recent times, he said.Labour shortages in farm areas, especially in rural areas, have hit production as youths are leaving the country as migrant workers, severely impacting production, Shrestha said.The price of essential kitchen staples like tomato, potato and onion has increased within a month.According to the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of local small tomatoes has increased by 62.63 percent within a month to Rs45 per kg on Tuesday, while Indian tomatoes saw an increase of 2.57 percent, and now costs Rs66.67 per kg. Also, the price of tomato small (tarai) has increased by 11.11 percent to Rs50 per kg. The price of tomato big (Nepali) has declined by 30.77 percent to Rs45 per kg.The wholesale price of potato red has increased by 14.54 percent within a month to Rs54.60 per kg while the price of potato (white) increased by 19.23 percent to Rs46.50 per kg. The price of potato red (Indian) has fallen marginally by 1.41 percent to Rs47 per kg.The wholesale price of onion dry (Indian) has increased by 22.65 percent to Rs83 per kg within a month.On May 4, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export tariff of $550 per tonne.The wholesale price of other vegetables like cabbage, cauliflower, eggplant, green peas, bottle gourd, squash, green vegetables, chilli, green coriander and garlic have gone up within a month.The wholesale price of cabbage increased by 22.44 percent to Rs40 per kg and cauliflower by 2.57 percent to Rs66.67 per kg within a month. Eggplant became dearer by 40 percent to Rs35 per kg in a month.Green peas became expensive by 100 percent to Rs170 per kg during the review period while bottle gourd price went up by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.Similarly, the price of squash increased by 20 percent to Rs30 per kg in a month. The price of green leafy vegetables like spinach and cress increased by 17.34 percent to Rs146.67 per kg within a month.The wholesale price of broccoli increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg.The wholesale price of chilli increased by 54.55 percent to Rs85 per kg while garlic dry (Nepali) price increased by 22.58 percent to Rs190 per kg within a month.Although it is the rainy season and peak vegetable season, prices have not dropped due to low rainfall, which has affected production, Shrestha said. Both the production and timely arrival of vegetables have suffered from lack of rain, leading to higher prices, he said.“Kalimati fruits and vegetable market used to receive 700-800 tonnes of vegetables daily during this season in past years, but now we are receiving 600-700 tonnes. The imbalance between supply and demand has ultimately driven up prices,” Shrestha said. \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nOver 1,500 teen girls in Nepal have yet to receive their second HPV vaccine dose, despite a pilot program's launch in 2022 and its planned inclusion in the nation's regular vaccination schedule in 2025.\nStarting next Sunday, 1.46 million children in Nepal born between April 2016 and October 2018 will receive inactivated polio vaccine to address the risk of Type-2 polio infection despite Nepal being polio-free since 2010.\nIndia's West Nile virus outbreak prompts Nepal to assess risk due to high temperature, monsoon, vectors, and human mobility.\nPollution, primarily air pollutants, has led to a surge in respiratory illnesses and other health issues, reducing the life expectancy of Nepalese citizens by 5 years.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra founded his New York supper club 'The Sewing Tin', serving innovative Nepali-inspired dishes that blend traditional flavors with modern culinary techniques, showcasing Nepal's culinary heritage globally.\nCeleus Baral, an environment science student, started baking during the 2020 lockdown and now runs the online baking shop Bakeleus, advocating for sustainable practices while experimenting to create unique baked goods.\nPotato, a staple food of hundreds of thousands of people, especially those residing in the mountainous regions, is among the most widely consumed and versatile crops in Nepal. The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a nutritious, self-sourced in Nepal, and have multiple health benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and protection against infections.\nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province.

My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nKolkata Knight Riders lifted their third Indian Premier League (IPL) title with an eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in a lop-sided final in Chennai on Sunday.Kolkata, who topped the group stage of the 10-team league, had beaten Hyderabad in the first qualifier on Tuesday and were even more dominant in the summit clash, which lasted 29 overs.Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins was left to rue his decision to bat first as his side got skittled out for 113 runs in 18.3 overs.Player-of-the-match Mitchell Starc produced a double strike while his new ball partner Vaibhav Arora dismissed the dangerous Travis Head for a first ball duck to rattle Hyderabad.Kolkata’s talismanic all-rounder Andre Russell claimed three crucial wickets, including those of South African Aiden Markram and rival captain Cummins, as Hyderabad wilted inside 19 overs.Defending the lowest total in an IPL final, Cummins removed Sunil Narine in the second over but the miracle they needed did not materialise.Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed an unbeaten 52 off 26 balls, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39) helped Kolkata romp home in 10.3 overs in front of a sea of purple jerseys that included franchise co-owner and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.“No words to describe (the feeling). It means so much,” West Indies stalwart Russell said wiping away tears.“I am happy that all of us were very disciplined and worked towards one goal. This franchise has done a lot for me. It's a big gift from all of us to them.”It was a special night for Kolkata mentor Gautam Gambhir, who captained the franchise to IPL titles in 2012 and 2014.“I thought they (Kolkata) bowled fantastically. Obviously not enough (from Hyderabad) tonight... They didn’t give us anything,” Cummins said of his side’s batting effort.“It was a tricky wicket. I didn’t feel it was like a 200-plus wicket. I think 160 would have given us a chance.”Royal Challengers Bengaluru crashed out in the playoffs but stalwart Virat Kohli won the orange cap as the league’s leading scorer with 741 runs from 15 matches.Punjab Kings seamer Harshal Patel won the purple cap for the league’s most successful bowler with 24 wickets from 14 matches even though his team did not make the playoffs.Kolkata’s Narine was adjudged the season’s Most Valuable Player for his all-round brilliance. \nThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday said it has requested the prime minister and the foreign ministry to take initiatives to help Sandeep Lamichhane get a US visa.The Embassy of the United States of America in Nepal had denied visa to Lamichhane, who is preparing to travel to the country and the West Indies to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.Lamichhane took to social media to to say his visa application had been rejected.“And the US Embassy, Nepal did it again like they did back in 2019, they denied my visa for the T20 World Cup happening in the US and the West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well wishers of Nepal Cricket,” Lamichhane wrote.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments as the country’s cricket governing body lifted his suspension, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape conviction by a district court.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.The Kathmandu District Court on December 29, 2023 convicted Lamichhane of raping a girl and sentenced him to eight years in prison on January 11.He was cleared to play following the verdict.“We have already requested the prime minister, the foreign ministry and other stakeholders to take initiatives in getting Lamichhane a visa for the US,” Chatur Bahadur Chand, the CAN president, told the Post.“The visa was rejected despite the application being attached with the high court’s order and letters from the International Cricket Council and CAN,” Chand added.“It is a matter of concern for the country. But we are hopeful he will get a visa.”The US Embassy said they could not comment on individual visa cases.“The US Embassy is extremely excited to have Nepal's men’s national cricket team, the Rhinos, participating in the T20 World Cup in the United States and, in fact, a few Embassy officials met with them a few weeks ago to appreciate and encourage them before they headed out. We are wishing the entire team the best in the coming games,” the US Embassy said.“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”CAN has reached out to the ICC to include Lamichhane in Nepal’s T20 World Cup squad.Lamichhane has been training regularly at the TU Cricket Ground.It is not the first time the US has denied him a visa. Lamichhane’s visa application was rejected by the US in 2019 for the Caribbean Premier League. He had taken the issue to Twitter (now X) to express his dissatisfaction over the visa denial. However, a few hours after his post, the embassy had called Lamichhane and given him a visa.Nepal had already announced their provisional 15-man squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.The Nepali team are already in the West Indies and have been training in St Vincent. ICC allows all 20 participating teams of the global showpiece to make changes and submit their final squad until May 25.The Rhinos played a three-match T20 practice series against Windwards Volcanoes, which they won 2-1. They will play warm-up matches against Canada and the US on May 27 and May 30 before launching their World Cup campaign against the Netherlands on June 4.Nepal are making their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nThe Embassy of the United States of America in Kathmandu on Wednesday declined to issue a visa to national cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane.The cricketer took to social media to say sorry to his fans.“The US Embassy did it again, as they did back in 2019. They denied my visa for the T20 World Cup in the USA and West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well-wishers of Nepal cricket,” Lamichhane said in a post on X.In 2019, the embassy initially rejected his visa while the cricketer was planning to play in the Caribbean Premier League. However, the embassy had later granted him a visa at the time.The Cricket Association of Nepal had taken the initiative to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad after the Patan High Court acquitted him of rape.Nepal will begin their 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4.All other squad members have already reached the West Indies to participate in the World Cup, which will be co-hosted by the US and the West Indies from June 1 to 29. In a response to the visa rejection, the embassy said it can’t comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup. We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law,” it said. \nMoments after the final whistle blew on Juergen Klopp’s managerial career at Liverpool, the much-loved German encouraged the Anfield faithful to celebrate the moment, but embrace the future.Klopp flashed his huge smile throughout a long address to fans after Liverpool’s 2-0 victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers in Sunday’s emotional Premier League season finale, and even led the crowd in a song for incoming manager Arne Slot, who has enormous shoes to fill.“Change is good,” the 56-year-old Klopp told the crowd. “And you never know exactly what to expect, but if you go with the right attitude into that, then everything will be fine.“What I want you to sing, I have an idea,” he added, then launched loudly into: “Arne Slot! Na, na, na, na, na!” The crowd sang along.On a day Liverpool fans had been dreading since Klopp announced in late-January he would leave at season’s end, the manager sounded genuinely happy rather than heartbroken.“It doesn’t feel like an end. It just feels like the start, because I saw today a football team playing full of talent, youth, creativity, desire, greed,” he said.“In these few weeks where I have had too much attention, I realised a lot of things. People say I turned them from doubters into believers. That’s not true.“I just said we have to. You did it. Nobody tells you to stop believing. This club is in a better moment than a long time. We have this wonderful stadium, training centre and you — the superpower of world football. Wow.”Klopp’s team, who were on course to give their manager a fairytale ending before a string of bad results last month derailed their title challenge, finished the season third in the table on 82 points, nine behind winners Manchester City and seven behind second-placed Arsenal.Klopp bade farewell to the Anfield faithful having won 305 matches, including penalty shootouts, since joining the Reds in 2015, plus seven trophies including the Champions League in 2019 and a first English League title in three decades in 2020.But he was loved as much for his charisma and passion as his on-field success and it was on full display on Sunday. He was saluted with a guard of honour in the post-game celebrations, and after pausing to wrap an emotional captain Virgil van Dijk in a bear hug, he turned and ran through it again.“It’s a very emotional day,” Van Dijk told Sky Sports. “(Klopp) deserves every bit of love that he’s getting.”Tears rolled down defender Trent Alexander-Arnold’s cheeks while the team stood arm-in-arm and the fans serenaded them with “You’ll Never Walk Alone.”“I’ve never seen or experienced someone who can inspire or motivate with a click of his fingers,” Alexander-Arnold told Sky. “If he told me today it was snowing outside, I’d believe him—that’s probably the best way of putting it.”Klopp famously introduced himself as “the normal one” in his first Liverpool press conference after his hiring, “but he’s definitely a special one for us for the players who played under his leadership,” the team’s Brazilian keeper Alisson Becker said.“His passion, his desire to win things, to achieve things... but he thinks about the personal side also, he wanted to do everything to make the players feel good to play for his team. I have so many good memories.”While Klopp’s departure announcement sent shock waves through the football world, the manager said he felt a sense of relief around his decision. His energy for the job was waning, he said. He could not do it on “three wheels.”He looks forward, he told Sunday’s crowd, to throwing his energy into being a fan.“Obviously I saw a lot of people crying and I will tonight too because I will miss people but change is good,” he said.“You welcome the new manager like you welcomed me. You go all in from the first day. You keep believing. You push the team. I’m one of you now. I love you to bits.”And before the final curtain came down on his time with the Merseyside club, Klopp ran the length of the Anfield pitch for one final round of fist pumps with the crowd, and then pointed with two thumbs to the back of his shirt, which read: “I’ll never walk alone again.” \nAn Israeli airstrike killed at least 35 people in a tent camp in the Gaza city of Rafah, medics said, drawing condemnation from European leaders on Monday who urged implementation of a World Court ruling to halt Israel’s offensive.In scenes grimly familiar from a war in its eighth month, Palestinian families rushed to hospitals to prepare their dead for burial after the strike late on Sunday night set tents and rickety shelters ablaze.Women wept and men held prayers beside bodies in shrouds.“The whole world is witnessing Rafah getting burnt up by Israel and no one is doing anything to stop it,” Bassam, a Rafah resident, said via a chat app, of the strike in an area of western Rafah that had been designated a safe zone.Despite a global outcry at the toll on civilians, Israeli tanks continued to bombard eastern and central areas of the city on Monday, killing eight, local health officials said.Israel’s military said Sunday’s air attack, based on “precise intelligence”, had eliminated militant group Hamas’ chief of staff for the second and larger Palestinian territory, the West Bank, plus another official behind attacks on Israelis.Earlier on Sunday, it had said eight rockets were intercepted after being fired from the Rafah area. A minister said that showed the need for continued operations against Hamas.Israel’s top military prosecutor, however, called the air strike “very grave” and said an investigation was underway.“The IDF (Israel Defence Forces) regrets any harm to non-combatants during the war,” Major-General Yifat Tomer Yerushalmi said at a conference on Monday.The attack took place in the Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, where thousands were sheltering after Israeli forces began a ground offensive in the east of Rafah over two weeks ago.Many of the dead were women and children, the health officials said, adding that the death toll was likely to rise as some were in critical condition with severe burns.Israel has kept up attacks on Rafah despite a ruling by the top U.N. court on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.Germany’s foreign minister Annalena Baerbock and the EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said the ruling must be respected. “International humanitarian law applies for all, also for Israel’s conduct of the war,” Baerbock said.NO SAFE ZONEBy daylight, the camp was a smoking wreckage of tents, twisted metal and charred belongings.Sitting beside bodies of his relatives, Abed Mohammed Al-Attar said Israel lied when it told residents they would be safe in Rafah’s western areas. His brother, sister-in-law and several other relatives were killed in the blaze.“The army is a liar. There is no security in Gaza. There is no security, not for a child, an elderly man, or a woman. Here he (my brother) is with his wife, they were martyred,” he said.“What have they done to deserve this? Their children have been orphaned.”Hospitals in Rafah, including the International Committee of the Red Cross field hospital, were unable to handle all the wounded, so some were moved to hospitals in Khan Younis further north in Gaza for treatment, medics said.The U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees said the situation was horrifying. “Gaza is hell on earth. Images from last night are yet another testament to that,” UNRWA wrote on X.Nearly 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched the operation after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.But it faces an international outcry.“On top of the hunger, on top of the starvation, the refusal to allow aid in sufficient volumes, what we witnessed last night is barbaric,” Ireland’s Foreign Minister Micheal Martin said.Egypt condemned the Israeli military’s “deliberate bombing of the tents of displaced people”, state media reported, describing it as a blatant violation of international law.Saudi Arabia also condemned the Israeli attack and Qatar said the Rafah strike could hinder efforts to mediate a ceasefire and hostage exchange.Israeli tanks have probed around the edges of Rafah, near the crossing point from Gaza into Egypt, since May 6 and have entered some of its eastern districts. \nMore than 2,000 people were buried alive by a massive landslide in Papua New Guinea last week, the national disaster centre said on Monday, as treacherous terrain and the difficulty of getting aid to the site raises the risk few survivors will be found.The numbers of those buried around Yambali village in Enga province in the country’s north are based on estimates from local authorities which have been rising steadily since Friday’s landslide.A UN agency put the estimated death toll at more than 670 people on Sunday.The National Disaster Centre raised the toll again to 2,000 in a letter to the UN on Sunday that was released publicly on Monday. The landslide also caused major destruction to buildings and food gardens, it said.“The situation remains unstable as the landslip continues to shift slowly, posing ongoing danger to both the rescue teams and survivors alike,” according to the letter.About 4,000 people were living near the affected area, CARE International PNG country director Justine McMahon told ABC television on Monday.But it is difficult to get an accurate estimate of the local population as PNG’s last credible census was in 2000 and many people live in remote mountainous villages. The country recently announced a census would be conducted in 2024.The unstable terrain, remote location and nearby tribal warfare are hampering relief efforts in Papua New Guinea.Emergency crews, led by Papua New Guinea’s (PNG) defence personnel, were on the ground, but the first excavator only reached the site late on Sunday, according to a UN official.Social media footage posted by villagers and local media teams showed people scaling rocks, digging with shovels, sticks and their bare hands to find survivors. Women could be heard weeping in the background.Six bodies have been retrieved so far. The UN said the number of possible deaths could change as rescue efforts were expected to continue for days.PNG media on Monday reported that residents had rescued a couple trapped under rubble after hearing their cries for help.Johnson and Jacklyn Yandam told local NBC News that they were very grateful and described their rescue as a miracle.“We thank God for saving our lives at that moment. We were certain that we were going to die but the big rocks didn’t crush us,” Jacklyn said. “It’s really hard to explain as we got trapped for nearly eight hours, then got rescued. We believe we were saved for a purpose.”About 1,250 people have been displaced by the landslide, which occurred in PNG’s Enga province early Friday. More than 150 houses were buried and about 250 houses abandoned.“The houses are buried under around eight metres (26.3 ft) of dirt. So there is quite a lot of debris to get through,” said CARE’s McMahon.DANGEROUS CONDITIONSWater continued to flow under the debris, the UN migration agency said, making it extremely dangerous for residents and the rescue team to clear debris.Serhan Aktoprak, the chief of the UN migration agency’s mission in PNG, told ABC television that emergency crews would continue to look for survivors until the residents asked them to stop.Aktoprak said that the rescue team had eight vehicles but that he hoped to receive additional resources soon.Tribal violence in the region has raised security concerns for road travel, with the military escorting convoys of rescue teams. Eight people were killed, and five shops and 30 houses burnt down on Saturday, the UN agency said.PNG gave arrest powers to its military in February amid an eruption of tribal violence that saw at least 26 men killed in an ambush.The landslide hit a section of highway near the Porgera gold mine, operated by Barrick Gold through Barrick Niugini Ltd, its joint venture with China’s Zijin Mining. Barrick has said the mine has enough fuel on site to operate for 40 days and other critical supplies for longer. \nStrong winds and heavy rain pounded the coastal regions of Bangladesh and India as severe cyclone Remal made landfall late on Sunday, leaving millions without electricity after power poles fell and some trees were uprooted by gusty winds.The storm crossed the coastal regions of Bangladesh’s Mongla port and the adjoining Sagar Islands in India’s West Bengal state with wind speed measuring up to 135 kmph, the India Meteorological Department (IMD) said.The storm will gradually weaken into a cyclone during the morning on Monday and then move northeast and gradually weaken further, the IMD said in its latest weather update.The landfall process began around 9 pm local time in India on Sunday and continued for about five hours, the regional meteorological office in Kolkata said.One person was killed in the major metropolitan city of Kolkata when concrete chunks fell on him during the peak of the storm, police said. Roofs of thatched huts were blown away while mud houses were flattened in the coastal areas of both countries as authorities waited to ascertain the full scale of losses.The low-lying coasts of South Asian neighbours Bangladesh and India have experienced frequent severe storms in recent years as climate change forces a rise in sea surface temperatures. Remal is the year’s first cyclone in the region.Bangladesh moved about 800,000 people from the port areas of Mongla and Chittagong and nine coastal districts to storm shelters from Sunday morning. As many as 110,000 people were also taken to shelters in India.Dhaka set up nearly 8,000 cyclone shelters and mobilised 78,000 volunteers ahead of the storm while the Indian navy said it had kept ships, aircraft, divers and medical supplies on standby for deployment if required.While early warnings and timely evacuations helped both countries avert major casualties from the storm, there was a heavy toll on power infrastructure.Authorities in Bangladesh shut down electricity supply to many areas in advance to avoid accidents while many coastal towns were left in the dark as fallen trees and broken lines disrupted supply, power ministry officials said.“We have no electricity since night, my mobile battery will run out anytime. By the grace of Allah, the cyclone was not as violent as we thought,” said Rahat Raja, a resident in the coastal district of Satkhira in Bangladesh.Reports of at least 356 uprooted electricity poles and damage to scores of transformers were received during the first hour of the landfall process, Arup Biswas, the minister for power in West Bengal government, said.More than 50 international and domestic flights had to be cancelled in Kolkata city as operations were suspended from Sunday noon. Bangladesh also suspended operations at Mongla and Chittagong ports.“Normal airport operations will resume from 9 am,” said C Pattavi, the director of the Kolkata airport, adding that the airport’s operational areas were clear from waterlogging.River embankments in the Sundarbans delta, the largest mangrove forest in the world, shared by India and Bangladesh, also suffered heavy damage with high tides breaching protective embankments at many places.Kolkata, like the state’s coastal belt, was also lashed by heavy rains with water logging in many areas, television footage showed. At least six trees were uprooted, which blocked roads, while there were also reports of wall collapses, police said.The cyclone also brought heavy rains to Bangladesh capital Dhaka, causing flooding of roads and severely impacting commuters. \nA Thai court on Monday sentenced opposition lawmaker Chonthicha Jangrew to two years in prison on Monday for insulting the monarchy, her lawyer said, over a speech she made three years ago at an anti-government protest.Chonthicha, 31, denies the charge of lese majeste and has been granted bail pending an appeal against the decision, lawyer Marisa Pidsaya told Reuters. The court had yet to issue a statement on the sentence.The law is one of the strictest of its kind in the world and seeks to protect Thailand's powerful monarchy from criticism, with prison terms of up to 15 years for each perceived insult.Chonthicha is currently a lawmaker for the popular opposition Move Forward Party, which has the most seats in parliament and is facing legal battles of its own over a previous plan to amend the royal insults law, which a court ordered it to drop from its manifesto.More than 272 people have been charged with insulting the monarchy since 2020, with 17 of those in jail in pre-trial detention, according to legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights, which compiles data and had defended many of those prosecuted.Thai activist musician Chaiamorn Kaewwiboonpan was also sentenced to four years in jail on Monday for insulting the monarchy and violations of the computer crimes act, local media reported.The case stems from Chaiamorn burning a portrait of King Maha Vajiralongkorn in 2021, which he admitted to doing, but had argued it was not a violation of the royal insult law.Last year, courts sentenced Move Forward lawmaker Rukchanok Srinork to six years in prison over social media posts that criticised the monarchy.The ruling comes two weeks after activist Netiporn “Bung” Sanesangkhom died in prison, where she was being held in pre-trial detention on charges that include royal insult. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn our previous article, \"Regulatory gaps in Nepal’s fintech\" (March 14, 2024), we discussed some regulatory gaps in fintech. In this piece, we will focus on the regulatory gaps primarily related to cybersecurity and data protection that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must quickly address. The fintech ecosystem in Nepal is growing, but it remains fragile in terms of cybersecurity and data protection. The NRB regulation should promote fintech innovation while also considering the importance of data protection and security.Technology is evolving, and so are cyber-attacks. In 2019, hackers stole almost Rs18.9 million from 13 Nepali banks using ATM terminals. They spoofed the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Limited (NEPS) link using fake cards, which enabled them to take money from the ATMs by independently verifying all the information of the Nepal bank's clients. This incident was one of the most prominent cases of cross-banking transactions via ATM cash-out hack and could happen again. Hence, the NRB should be aware of such incidents. The court decided to punish the perpetrators; however, as it wasn’t physical loot, a detailed investigation to find out the root cause would have been an appropriate step by the central bank. Such investigations could provide insights and further strengthen the system security of such companies and bank and financial institutions in Nepal.Clause 44 of the Payment and Settlement Bylaw, 2077 (First Amendment, 2080) addresses the liability of the payment system operators (PSO)/payment service providers (PSP) in case of any disputes or any other loss arising from incidents such as cyber-attacks. However, the absence of explicit guidance regarding the extent of liability raises concerns. For instance, a PSO with a paid-up capital of Rs50 million must be given clear guidelines on their liability in the worst-case scenario, or there must be a limit on how much of their customers’ funds they can retain. Additionally, it is the right time to introduce a government guarantee fund, like the deposit and credit guarantee fund (DCGF), to protect the public from loss arising from data breaches and other cyber incidents. If the government had set up such funds, it would have been more vigilant and strict on cybersecurity measures. This would be a win-win situation for all parties.Furthermore, no insurance products are available in Nepal to hedge companies against any loss due to data breaches or similar security incidents. The lack of insurance coverage leaves companies vulnerable to hacking and losses. It might be appropriate for the regulator to open a pathway for companies in Nepal to obtain cyber insurance, even from foreign companies, until insurance companies in Nepal launch such products.Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw and Directive No. 3 of the NRB Unified Directive Related to Payment Systems, 2079, discusses the security policies and practices for PSO/PSP. Implementing a uniform requirement for payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27,000 certifications across all financial institutions involved in payment processing would ensure a data protection baseline, mitigating the risks of cyber threats. The language of the Directive is clear: A licensed institution shall adhere to the standards of PCI DSS, Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) Standard, EMV Contactless Standard, etc. However, a mechanism to ensure that these standards are followed is unclear. Had it been mentioned that certification like PCI DSS is mandatory, it would have made more sense since an independent third party always issues a certification. Similarly, regulatory requirements always act as the baseline for security, and these NRB guidelines are the minimum requirements spread across the industry. Further, data security is not a matter of securing them for a point of time only; it is a regular, ongoing activity that needs the attention of the stakeholders. Similarly, if we look through most payment-related companies’ websites, except for a few big players, we don’t find much information related to their security and related certifications.A provision requiring each licensed institution to disclose its licenses and certifications, commitment to data security, and other related matters on its website and update it regularly must be introduced to increase public awareness and invoke dialogues between the stakeholders. Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw contains a provision for system audit while it also mentions a provision for an annual system audit. In contrast, the Directive states that a system audit is mandatory after a year of operation and every two years when there are no changes in the existing system. These two provisions contradict each other, and the regulator must provide clarification on the same. Two years to conduct a system audit is pretty long, and so payment-related institutions must conduct at least an annual system audit in light of the rise of cyber threats in the present context.Awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity is a pressing need today since most occur due to human negligence. Social engineering is the most common way through which intruders can gather data and find loopholes in a payment system. To improve cyber risk measures, visibility is required on the organisation's risk dashboard, covering all inherent risk levels to provide a picture of what is being defended. Lastly, continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to risk management is the only way against cyber-attacks. The country’s payment industry is still in its infancy, and before something worse happens, all the stakeholders must join hands to protect the public’s interest. \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe emergence of a leader is possible through hard work, confidence, determination, ideas and identification with issues. Leaders are created by movements, long democratic practices and immediate events triggered by people’s frustration and anger. However, instant leaders are short-lived and fade away after they fail to imbibe perseverance, commitment and the qualities of being patient. Such leaders are soon seduced by power and privileges as their role is made for the time being. In Nepal, many ambitious youth have shown the characteristics of instant leaders who are easily exposed and stigmatised. Watching the Indian political scene for the last few years, it seems that it is the coming of age of Rahul Gandhi. Sooner or later, he will likely play a crucial role in Indian politics. Rahul’s rise is possible not because he happened to be a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family but because of his dedication, perseverance, hard work and the ability to be closer to the people of India. Rather than being elitist, he is perceived as people-centred and egalitarian in his mission and actions, contrary to his aristocratic family background. Rahul is evolving as a leader despite the humiliation and insinuation hurled at him by his opponents.His mission to unify India, accept unity in the diversity of Indian society and polity, and his steadfast commitment to safeguarding the Republican constitution by finding suitable guardrails have paid him rich dividends in recent elections. Whatever the results, he has surpassed all other country leaders, endearing himself to ordinary people. Born with a silver spoon, Rahul has unique personality traits. He has the knack of being humble; sometimes, he finds himself in ordinary train compartments, travelling with fellow travellers, shaving his beard in an ordinary salon in Rae Bareli, eating chhole-bhature in Delhi street, mixing with kids while undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra, or taking sweets in an ordinary shop somewhere in South India. These activities make him the darling of the masses. Narendra Damodar Modi, now the Prime Minister, by contrast, also has the humble background of being the son of a tea-seller at the Gujrat railway station and has emerged as a charismatic leader over time. Nevertheless, the taste of power that he enjoyed as a long-time chief minister of Gujrat and later as the country leader for over a decade seems to have transformed him into an elitist leader with a disposition for a luxurious life. However, Modi continues to be popular among his colleagues and has become the only star campaigner for his party during the three parliamentary elections in 2014, 2019 and 2024. Weary and exhausted, Modi’s charisma is declining due to his age and failure to deliver on the people’s basic needs. Moreover, India today is a highly polarised country, as the BJP government is criticised for using religion as a weapon to scare minorities, especially Muslims. The Hindutwa agenda is interpreted as the divisive doctrine propounded and practised by orthodox BJP leaders. Contrarily, Rahul has taken up this agenda, arguing that he wants to propagate love, not hatred, as he has been repeating since his long march from the deep South to Kashmir and Manipur to Maharastra. He has assured the people that he would not allow the constitution, which embraces the “unity in diversity” principle, to be destroyed. Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    \nNepal on Wednesday and Thursday held an international dialogue on climate issues of mountainous countries. Titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change,” it saw the participation of representatives from 23 countries gathered to strengthen coordination among mountain countries on climate change-related issues. The dialogue has been instrumental in positioning mountains at the centre of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On Thursday itself, 22 people from Madhesh reached Kathmandu after a 25-day walk, calling for saving the Chure mountains. They have come with a 12-point charter of demands, which include saving the water sources, jungles and mountains in the Chure region apart from protecting the land itself.One of the most fragile mountain ranges in South Asia, the Chure range consists of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. Around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long, the range is a lifeline for the Madhesh region, providing water, minerals and vegetation. However, the water sources originating from the foothills of Chure have dried up in recent years due to exploitation, leading to the depletion of the first layer of the underground water in the Bhawar and Madhesh regions. The depletion of water has already impacted people in Madhesh, with ponds, tube wells and hand pumps running dry.The culprits of the degradation of Chure are all too familiar: The sand, land and timber mafia that is only interested in making a profit and the three tiers of government that have no regard for the present and future of the nation and its citizens. But there has been little effort to stop the exploitation of the fragile mountains. As the Chure continues to turn into a desert, we are staring at a significant crisis of water and food scarcity.The President Chure-Tarai Madhes Conservation Area Programme has been making some significant interventions, especially related to water conservation, building ponds and irrigation channels. But these efforts have been too slow and inadequate considering the rapid deforestation and extraction in the region. The campaigners who have marched to Kathmandu say the foremost work the governments of all levels must do is to shut down the crusher and sand mining industries in the region. Moreover, they demand that the government declare Dilip Mahato, an activist who was killed by illegal sand miners, as the “First environmental martyr” of Nepal. What is significant about these campaigners is that they are not just activists speaking for an environmental cause, but victims of the impacts of environmental damage and face risks to their lives. The government must, therefore, listen to their demands and act to fulfil them.The campaigners for saving the Chure plan sit-ins at different places in Kathmandu—the common protest site at Maitighar as well as the offices of various political parties. The central government in Kathmandu, which is often too quick in manhandling protesters of all kinds, would do well to listen to the campaigners this time. They have come up with a message that is important not only for themselves but for the entire nation. The degradation of Chure impacts us all, and if we do not listen to the campaigners and act on time, we will be staring at a bleak future. \nAir pollution has plunged the world into a global public health crisis, and Nepal is no exception. The air we inhale for survival is one of the leading causes of illness, as reported by The Lancet, a medical journal. Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have become all too common now. Besides these, ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases, heart problems, and so on are attributed to bad air. The vulnerability of children, women, the elderly and underrepresented groups to air pollution adds to the urgency of its mitigation.The impact of toxic air is particularly harsh on Nepalis as our federal capital, Kathmandu, often tops the list of most polluted cities globally. Only a few weeks ago, Pokhara Metropolitan City’s air was unbreathable for several days. The southern plains met the same fate. This poor air quality has reduced our life expectancy by a staggering 4.6 years, as per the report by the Air Quality Life Index of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The situation is worse in nine southern districts (Mahottari, Rautahat, Dhanusha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha and Rupandehi). These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  \nNepal's Home Minister misused authority by arresting Kantipur Media Group chairman Kailash Sirohiya over alleged citizenship discrepancies in retaliation for critical reporting.\nAmnesty International's Secretary General expresses concern over global human rights backsliding, particularly in South Asia, citing shrinking civic space, weaponization of laws, and impunity for past crimes in Nepal and Sri Lanka, highlighting the role of populism and economic inequality in fueling authoritarianism, and emphasizing the need for international cooperation on transitional justice and climate change.\nThe Unified Socialist, a splinter group of the CPN-UML, prepares for its first general convention amid poor electoral performance, lackluster service delivery, and ongoing leadership disputes with the Congress and the UML.\nDespite significant development progress, Nepal grapples with poverty, inequality, climate change, and environmental degradation, posing obstacles to LDC graduation and achieving SDGs.

Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
