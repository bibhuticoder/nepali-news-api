Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government and the main opposition Nepali Congress have reached an understanding on the terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary probe panel on the cooperatives scam. They came to an agreement during a meeting of the leaders of four major parties on Monday evening.Though three parties—the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party—had agreed to constitute a parliamentary committee on May 18 and formed a task force to draft the panel’s terms of reference (TOR), the task force struggled to finalise the terms due to conflicting stances of the ruling and opposition parties. Now the Rastriya Prajatantra Party has also come on board. While the party is not represented in the task force, it will have representation in the parliamentary probe committee. According to the members of the task force, with Monday’s understanding, the government will be able to present the annual budget on Tuesday. “We have agreed, in principle, on the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee,” said Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress. “The House will also resume Tuesday.”The understanding comes on the eve of the budget presentation day. Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun will present the annual budget for 2024-25 at a joint session of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. The main opposition Congress, which has been obstructing the House to put pressure on the government to form the parliamentary panel, had earlier threatened to obstruct budget presentation on Tuesday if the ruling parties continued to ignore its demand.“Some details of the TOR will be discussed and agreed on during a meeting tomorrow morning,” Sishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, who represents the party in the task force, told the Post.Jeevan Pariyar and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Nepali Congress; Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri and Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Khanal from the RSP are the members of the task force mandated to chart out the parliamentary committee’s terms of reference. According to Congress sources, there has been an agreement to form a seven-member parliamentary committee to look into the misuse of funds in several cooperatives including those based in Pokhara, Butwal and Bharatpur (Chitwan). The Nepali Congress has been accusing Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of obtaining loans illegally from three cooperatives based on these cities to fund his television channel, Gorkha Media Network, which is now defunct. “We are very close to an agreement that we will make it public tomorrow,” said Padam Giri, minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. “A meeting of the task force will sit tomorrow morning and give final touches to the ToR.”As agreed among the parties, the ToR will specifically mention the names of Surya Darshan Cooperatives of Kaski, Sahara Cooperatives of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperatives of Butwal, all of which have been linked to the home minister Lamichanne but are owned by GB Rai, who used to run the Gorkha Media Network.  “Then we will initiate a probe into the financial embezzlement in these cooperatives and a few others,” said a Nepali Congress leader. “Home Minister Lamichhane’s name will not be mentioned in the ToR. But the parties have agreed to probe financial embezzlement that took place in the Gorkha Media Network.” The home minister had reportedly drawn millions of rupees in loans from three cooperatives while he served as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network.Parties had agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives, and financial embezzlement in the three cooperatives, but the ruling parties emphatically rejected the opposition’s demand for inclusion of the home minister’s name in the TOR.Billions of rupees were illegally transferred from several cooperatives to fund the Gorkha Media Network. The funds were syphoned off by GB Rai, who used to run the three cooperatives based in Pokhara, Chitwan and Butwal and ran the now defunct Galaxy 4K television. “Although no names will be mentioned in the TOR,” said Giri, “if any financial foul play is discovered in the running of the Gorkha Media Network, legal action will be recommended for the culprit.” According to the Nepali Congress and UML’s leaders, the seven-member task force will initially be given at least three months to complete the investigation, subject to renewal if it cannot complete its task on time.As per the understanding, two members each from the Congress and the UML and one each from the CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party will be members of the parliamentary panel. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was active throughout Monday in order to find common ground and was busy meeting leaders from both ruling and opposition parties. In case there was no agreement, the Congress leaders had threatened to obstruct the house and disturb the finance minister’s budget presentation. It was the Congress that first raised the demand for the formation of the parliamentary committee after Rabi Lamichhane was appointed deputy prime minister and home minister on March 6. \nThe Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended the remand of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya by three days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.On Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own.On Saturday, police in Dhanusha interrogated Kashiraj Dahal, who was an administrative officer in the district 24 years ago, on the issue. During the interrogation, Dahal said the sign on Sirohiya’s citizenship copy was his own and was issued based on the original document.The extension of judicial custody comes despite national and international media organisations, rights bodies, business fraternity and leaders condemning the arrest. Protest programmes have been organised in various districts of Madhesh Province, including Dhanusha, demanding Sirohiya’s immediate release.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after Indrajit Mahato, a cadre of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.Sirohiya is currently undergoing treatment at the Janakpur-based Kavya Hospital following heart-related problems.Police arrested Sirohiya and started investigation stating that another person Shivaji Sahu Teli also has a citizenship certificate with the same number.Chief District Officer Ramuraj Kadariya and Superintendent of Police Bhuwaneshwar Tiwari have allegedly kept Teli, who ekes out a living as a rickshaw puller, under pressure. They have instructed him not to meet anyone or talk to them. The local administration has deployed some detectives to monitor Teli's activities.The investigation officers reached Teli’s residence and quizzed him a few days ago. He was also summoned to the District Police Office for inquiry.Earlier, the Post had made several attempts to meet Teli for reporting, but was unsuccessful. The Post was finally able to meet a panic-stricken Teli, along with his wife Pawandevi Sahu, on Monday.“Police have told me not to meet or talk to anyone. I am under stress. My health has worsened and I have been suffering from anxiety,” said Teli, an asthma patient. Teli said that in the past few days he had been unable to go to the city to operate his rickshaw.  \nEight of 10 local units of Achham, a remote hill district in Sudurpaschim Province, laid foundations for the construction of basic hospitals four years ago as part of the federal government’s ambitious plan to build a hospital in every local unit across the country.The local people were hopeful of receiving quality health services in their own local units. However, four years on, the federal project remains incomplete in the district.Ramaroshan Rural Municipality has not yet initiated the construction work to build the hospital building. Deepak Khanal, the information officer at the rural municipality, said that the rural municipality failed to proceed with any work for the hospital construction due to a dispute regarding the construction site.“The rural municipality had invited a tender for hospital construction before the local elections of 2022 but nobody submitted a bid then,” Khanal said. “New people’s representatives were elected soon after that. The rural municipality has not taken any decision regarding the construction of the hospital building.”With an objective of providing basic health services to the people, the federal government in the annual budget for the fiscal year 2019-20 had announced plans to construct one hospital each in all 753 local units of the country. On November 30, 2020, the people’s representatives had laid the foundation stones to construct five- to 15-bed hospitals in 396 local units simultaneously across the country with a plan to complete the project within two years.There already are two hospitals in the district—the district hospital in Mangalsen Municipality and the Bayalpata Hospital in Sanphebagar Municipality.For the construction of a basic hospital at a local level, the approval of that local unit concerned and the recommendation of the district coordination committee is required. For the construction of a five-bed hospital, 5.6 ropani [0.28 hectares] of land and 7.2 ropani [0.37 hectares] of land for the construction of a 10-bed and 15-bed hospital are needed, with a clear description of that land in the land ownership certificate.After the land is secured, the detailed project report for the hospital should be prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Health and Population, and a budget is only allocated after the ministry approves the initial report.The construction of a 10-bed hospital, which has been started in Turmakhand Rural Municipality, has not yet been completed.Ekendra Bayak, head of the health unit at Turmakhand Rural Municipality, said that an agreement was signed with a construction company. But despite multiple deadline extensions, the construction remains incomplete. The last deadline expires at the end of the current fiscal year.“It seems impossible to complete the construction by the end of the current fiscal year, and locals are outrageous about it,” said Bayak. “There is a dire need for a hospital in the rural municipality because the existing Turmakhand Health Post is in a dilapidated condition.”Jhanakraj Dhungana, head of the Achham Health Office, said that the hospitals are being built from federal government funds, and once the construction contract is issued, it is the responsibility of the local unit concerned to monitor and regulate the work.“The local units are the ones that awarded the contracts and are responsible for starting the work. If anything goes wrong, it is the local unit’s responsibility,” said Dhungana.Nandaram Budha, a local of ward 4 of Turmakhand Rural Municipality, said that local officials complain that the construction company does not work on time, while the construction company blames the local unit. And as such, locals who will benefit from it are puzzled as to whose fault exactly it is.“After hearing that there is going to be a hospital in our local unit, all the locals were thrilled because we only have a health post, and sick people were forced to make an arduous journey on foot to the district hospital,” Budha said. “But now I doubt our dream will come true.”The 15-bed hospital in Chaurpati Rural Municipality has also not been completed.Dhan Bahadur Thapa, chief administrative officer of the Chaurpati Rural Municipality, said that an agreement was signed with a construction company at a cost of Rs120 million three years ago to complete the work within two years of time.“We already gave the construction company one extension, and as per the government regulations, we can grant another if needed. So far, the groundwork and foundation have been completed, and the deadline will end on May 28,” said Thapa. “A meeting will soon be held with the company to discuss the issue.”Hikmat Bahadur Budha, chief administrative officer of Mellekh Rural Municipality, said that the construction of the hospital will be completed, but the real challenge will come after that.“Although the federal government has provided the budget for the construction, the government has not said anything about essential manpower and equipment, among other things,” Budha said. \nThe floor of Parliament during the budget presentation has been a perennial battleground of Nepali politics.In recent years, the budget presentation has been chaotic including some instances of physical altercations. To announce the budget, the lawmakers have had to be controlled by marshals. And this drama may play out this year too.The ongoing feud between the ruling and opposition parties over forming a parliamentary inquiry committee on the misappropriation of cooperative savings may have spillover effects on the budget, which once again may be introduced through ordinances on Tuesday.Nepal’s economy, still reeling from the fallout of the pandemic and global geopolitics, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook due to frequent government changes, rampant corruption and irregularities, and the exodus of youths who see no future in the country.Many of the downside risks flagged by economists have begun to materialise.Experts say that aside from economic considerations, Nepal’s unstable national politics could also cause problems for the economy.Some key data released a few weeks ago confirm that Nepal’s construction and manufacturing sector is still in recession. The wholesale and retail sector has avoided the recession while tourism and agriculture have grown slightly. Economists say the country’s economy is doing badly. As industries are producing less, more people are going jobless. “If lawmakers give low or no priority to bringing the annual budget in the current situation, it will further drag down economic growth,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist.“What is happening currently is not healthy politics. In Parliament, the ongoing politics is more centred on individual interest.” “If political parties were serious about the country, the principles and priorities of the budget would have been discussed,” Adhikari said. “The budget would have been presented easily, well-discussed, reviewed and approved.”Even the policies and programmes were delayed and not even discussed, Adhikari said.Economists say that uncertain budget execution dashes hopes of the entire population. Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary probe on the misappropriation of cooperatives savings, particularly pointing the index finger at the incumbent Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, which the ruling alliance is reluctant to initiate. But this is not the first controversy related to corruption and irregularities that has marred ruling-opposition relations.Nepal’s economic reforms in the 1990s promised a liberal market-based economy, but even after three and a half decades, successive governments have shown little favour towards private businesses.“Crony capitalism distorts the efficiency of a free market. Yet Nepal is in the clutches of crony capitalism where limited people, families and communities benefit,” said Adhikari. Protecting them will only stir up power struggles in politics, bulldozing the hopes and aspirations of the people, he said. Economist Keshav Acharya said that when the budget comes under political pressure, nobody will take its ownership. Past experiences have shown that the budget undergoes numerous revisions with each new government coming to power. “The ongoing politics is weighing heavily on the economy. On the eve of the budget presentation, we are uncertain how it is coming. Will it be through ordinances or common consensus?” Acharya said. “Such uncertainty is not helpful when it comes to meeting the budget’s objectives.” Nepal's private sector contributes over 80 percent to the GDP, making it a crucial driver of economic growth. However, due to the fragile political system, investors have pulled back on investment.The annual spending of the three tiers of government stands at a combined Rs500 billion. The private sector pumps four times more into the national economy. Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, recently told a press conference that under the current investment model, the total investment amounts to Rs2.5 trillion. “At this investment rate, Nepal’s economic growth will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static.”He said that without encouraging private investment, Nepal will not be able to achieve double-digit economic growth. “We need to increase expenditure. We need to encourage the private sector to invest.”Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, said the private sector wants the bureaucracy and the policies to be stable. “Governments changing every six months will not be a problem if policies remain constant.”“The fiscal budget is a policy document to drive the economy. The private sector mainly looks for stable policies and their implementation.”The Nepali economy has historically been stuck in a low-growth trap in the past decades due to a decade-long Maoist insurgency followed by strikes, shutdowns, load-shedding, and earthquakes.Nepal in 2015 was struck by two powerful earthquakes of magnitudes 7.8 and 7.3 on April 25 and May 12, respectively, killing 8,790 people and injuring 22,300. The economic loss was estimated at $7 billion, out of which 76 percent was in the private sector.Following the disaster, Nepal’s economic growth rate plunged to 3.98 percent in the fiscal year 2014-15 and decelerated further to 0.43 percent in 2015-16.But since then, a flurry of post-disaster activities led to a breakneck speed of growth. The Nepali economy grew by 8.98 percent in the fiscal year 2016-17, the highest growth rate since the fiscal year 1993-94.In 2017-18, the economy grew by 7.62 percent and 6.66 percent in 2018-19, according to the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, the main government body that deals with the country's vital statistics.The worst came in 2019-20 when the world was hit by the Covid pandemic. The pandemic-induced supply and demand shock on the global economy caused Nepal's economy to plunge to a negative 2.37 percent.According to the World Bank, this was Nepal's first annual negative growth rate since 1982-1983, when its economic growth rate plummeted to -2.97 percent.The statistics office then attributed the negative growth rate to a drought in 1980-81, which in turn led to a severe food crisis.Nepal’s economy, which rebounded strongly after Covid, has been marred by political instability and haphazard decisions to gain short-term benefits, economists say.“There is politics everywhere, but that hardly affects most of the country’s economy. In Nepal, if the politics is unstable, the bureaucracy follows suit. That’s a bane for Nepalis and the economy,” said Acharya, the economist.  \nNepal’s cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane still has a chance to join Nepal’s squad in the United States and the West Indies for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup if he obtains a visa from the United States.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has submitted the list of only 14 players to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the World Cup, leaving one slot for leg spinner Lamichhane.All 20 participating teams had a May 25 deadline to submit their 15-man squad for the World Cup, including change in the provisional 15-member squad.“We have sent a list of only 14 players to the ICC for now because we still hope Lamichhane will get a visa from the US Embassy,” CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand told the Post.Last week, the US Embassy in Nepal denied a visa to Lamichhane which has jeopardised his hopes to participate in the World Cup.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments by the country’s cricket governing body, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.Nepal had already announced their provisional squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.“The ICC has already approved our request to include Lamichhane in the final 15-member World Cup squad,” Chand added. “If Lamichhane receives a visa in a few days, he will be included in the squad.”CAN will required approval from ICC’s event technical committee to make changes in Nepal’s squad.However, CAN has not yet revealed the name of the player who was not included in the list of the 14 players submitted to the ICC.If Lamichhane does not get a US visa, the 15 players currently in the team will play the World Cup, according to Chand.“We have requested the government to clarify the situation regarding Lamichhane to the US Embassy and make the environment favourable to Lamichhane,” Chand further said. “We hope he gets a visa because it is what our cricket fans want.”Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York, while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nKantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was flown to Kathmandu on Tuesday for further treatment.Sirohiya, who was admitted to the Kavya Hospital in Janakpur after experiencing heart-related problems on May 25, was brought to the Capital at around 3:30 pm and has been taken to the Nepal Mediciti Hospital, Lalitpur. The KMG Chair, who had fallen sick since last Thursday, was admitted to the Janakpur-based hospital after he had a headache, high blood pressure and fluctuating heartbeat.According to Navin Kumar, a member of the board of advisors for Nepal Mediciti Hospital, Sirohiya is in the emergency ward and his essential tests are being conducted.“The doctors will brief him on his condition once the test reports come,” Kumar said.Sirohiya is in police custody in connection with the investigation after a cadre of Rastriya Swatantra Party of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane filed a complaint stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.The Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended his remand by three more days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.Previously on Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma had extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after RSP cadre Indrajit Mahato filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person Shivaji Sahu Teli’s citizenship certificate.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own. \nThe House of Representatives on Tuesday formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperative fraud.Speaker Devraj Ghimire announced the formation of the committee at the meeting of the lower house.The committee is headed by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa.Members include Sarita Bhusal of UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Nepali Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.Earlier today, the task force formed to draft the terms of reference (ToR) for a parliamentary probe panel on cooperative scams agreed on the panel’s jurisdiction.The committee was formed as per the demand of the main opposition Nepali Congress that had been demanding such a committee to probe cooperative fraud and had even been obstructing parliamentary proceedings demanding the same. The parliament had seen prolonged deadlock as the ruling and opposition parties had differing views over the jurisdiction of the committee.The main opposition party demanded that the name of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane should be mentioned in the committee’s jurisdiction as he was allegedly involved in the embezzlement of millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before joining the politics. But the ruling parties, mainly the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane and the CPN-UML, strongly opposed the proposal to specifically mention his name. After weeks-long negotiations, the two sides agreed to mention the name of the media company and remain silent about his name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. \nThe government has announced to prioritise reservoir-based hydroelectric projects.Presenting the budget for the upcoming fiscal year in Parliament, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said that construction of hydropower projects with large generation capacity will be started. He said the construction of the 1200 MW Budhigandaki Hydropower Project and the 1061 MW Upper Arun Hydropower Project would be started. He also said the government would start construction of the Nalagad, Jagdulla, and Naumure multipurpose hydropower projects.The minister said the construction of 77.5 MW Ghunsa and 70 MW Ghunsa Khola hydropower projects would be funded with the investment from the Nepalis in foreign employment.He announced that the government would start the construction of the 783 MW Sunkoshi III hydropower project.The government aims to connect 100 MW of solar projects from the private sector to the national grid. \nThe government has allocated almost Rs12 billion for the tourism sector.Unveiling the budget for fiscal 2024-25, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said that a budget of Rs11.91 billion has been earmarked for the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.Pun also said that the government aims to welcome 1.6 million tourists in the upcoming fiscal year.The finance minister also announced plans to facilitate foreign tourists who come to Nepal for wedding ceremonies in a bid to promote various cultural and tourist destinations within the country as wedding destinations.The government will also lease government lands to the private sector for hotel construction to increase the number of tourists.Roadways, electricity and water facilities will be provided to such buildings via cooperation between the local and provincial governments, Pun added.A budget of Rs5.46 billion has also been allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, such as repairing roadways and establishing tourist rescue centres in potential risk-prone areas, among others. The amount will be spent through the Tourism Department. \nFinance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday announced a Rs1.86 trillion budget estimate for the fiscal year 2024-25.The budget size for the next fiscal year 2024-25, beginning mid-July, is 6.2 percent more than the unrevised budget of the current fiscal year. The government had allocated Rs1.75 trillion budget for the fiscal year 2023-24.Addressing a joint session of the Parliament on Tuesday, Minister Pun said that the recurrent expenditure has been estimated to be Rs1.14 trillion, which is 61.31 percent of the total budget.Likewise, the capital expenditure has been estimated to be Rs352 billion, which is 18.94 percent of the budget, and the expenditure for financial management has been estimated at Rs367 billion, 19.74 percent of the budget.According to Pun, the source of financing will be Rs1.26 trillion from revenue, Rs330 billion from internal loans, Rs217 billion from external loans, and Rs52.3 billion from foreign grants. \nDeveloping infrastructure in remote parts of Nepal has historically been a neglected issue. Things were expected to improve after the introduction of the federal system. The new system came into full-fledged implementation after the first elections of federal, provincial and local units in 2017. One of the major objectives for adopting the federal system was to devolve powers to sub-national governments and strengthen them in terms of easing people’s daily lives, cutting red tape and taking state facilities closer to their doorsteps. After seven years of execution of the three-tier federal system, the sub-national authorities, however, couldn’t bring about expected improvement—bar some exceptions.Even now people in far-flung villages across the country are compelled to struggle for basic facilities. A recent report from our local correspondent in Panchthar narrates the plight of Hilihang villagers’s struggles for drinking water due to acute water shortage. People there have to make an hour-long journey to fetch water. On Monday, a report from Achham offered a glimpse of people’s struggle even to draw their social security allowances: the government provides certain amounts to single women, elderly and disabled on a monthly basis to help with their livelihoods. But folks in remote villages including those from the Turmakhand Rural Municipality have to trek for up to three days to reach the administrative centre of the rural municipality to collect their allowances. These representative cases show how people in Nepal’s villages are falling far behind in terms of enjoying even basic amenities.Nepal can’t develop without improving the status of its villages. Of the 753 local units, 460 are rural municipalities, 276 are municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan and six are metropolitan cities. This classification shows the vast majority of our local units are still poor in infrastructure. To lift the status of people in the villages, the first need is to ensure roads, telephone and internet connectivity, which are basic needs in this day and age—besides the all-important facilities like health, education and drinking waterElderly people in Turmakhand of Achham district need to trek for days to reach the municipality’s administrative centre to get their allowances. Often, the municipalities centralise most facilities at the administrative centres. In many local units, a ward now covers an area that used to be an entire village development committee (VDC), a local body before adoption of the federal system. So, in terms of providing basic services, wards should be developed as a base station and be better equipped, resourceful and efficient to accomplish basic tasks on their own.The local units too need to explore alternatives to help people get quick and efficient services. For instance, they can mobilise mobile government teams, comprising officials from all agencies concerned, to tour villages and provide allowances and other services periodically. This in turn calls for better planning and coordination among local administrations. Moreover, provincial governments and representatives need to work harder in terms of making service delivery more efficient as well. Such initiatives have become imperative to retain people in the fast-emptying villages across the country due to the increasing trend of internal as well as external migration.  \n“Harvard, do you hear us?” Shruthi Kumar, a graduating student, raised this poignant question during her off-script speech at the Harvard University Commencement on May 23. She furiously upbraided the elite school (like many other college campuses in the US) for trying to silence pro-Palestine voices on campus. Protesting against what many consider the excesses of this government on the owner of Kantipur Media Group, Kailash Sirohiya, I want to ask: Prime Minister, do you hear us?Whack one to silence allSadly, the crackdown on the KMG publisher on May 21, 2024, resembles the action of the then autocratic King Gyanendra Shah in early June 2001. Sirohiya, Editor-in-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire and director Binod Raj Gyawali were detained for nine days and charged with sedition after Kantipur Daily published Baburam Bhattarai’s article. Bhattarai was the principal ideologue of the armed Maoist insurgency—which was then raging across the country—led by none other than the incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.If Dahal still has any sense of honesty and morality left in him, he should feel humiliated to have the same KMG owner booked, king-style, on some flimsy allegations of acquiring fake or multiple citizenships decades ago. Even the monarchist forces hadn’t quite harassed and intimidated the publishing house and its chief executive like this. Most observers, including reputed international bodies like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Journalists, smell a rat in this incident. Although Sirohiya has been arrested ostensibly for allegedly falsifying his citizenship certificate, the real purpose seems to be to silence the criticism of the government’s important ministers and curb press freedom. The government appears to think that once you whack the main guy hard, all the group members will automatically fall in line. The amount of success this endeavour will gain is for the future to tell. However, the potential repercussions may outweigh its achievements. Defence of democracyIt is widely suspected that the arrest is more of a personal vengeance, of a nasty vendetta by the irritated rulers. KMG seems to have been punished by the authorities for conducting deep research on Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of large sums of funds from various cooperatives in many towns. This made KP Oli and Dahal uncomfortable as their defence for Lamichhane appeared increasingly untenable, which meant the coalition’s future became uncertain.I have nothing to do with personal tussles amongst people in power; Sirohiya, too, is not without access to power. Nevertheless, I am concerned by the latest developments because I greatly value press freedom. Independent media is a pillar of democracy. Democracy suffers damage once that independent space shrinks. It doesn’t matter whether one loves or hates KMG. I have my grievances against it and have publicly expressed some of them. I want it to be more inclusive and accommodating of diverse voices. It should do more to support the cause of lower classes, castes and neglected regions and religions. However, this is not the time, as some people are doing, to vilify and pour anger at KMG and discuss its weaknesses and limitations. This would only serve the purpose of the parties and leaders in power who are intent on sapping the freedom of expression for their own vested interests. I warn people against the coalition leadership’s potentially dangerous road towards greater intolerance and authoritarianism. I think the opposition’s—Nepali Congress party—assertion along this line is timely and appropriate. We need to be vigilant about the communists and the populists colluding to shrink the democratic space. Responsible citizens should always put their finger in the dyke. Demoralising businesses The rulers’ ultimate gain from this undue punishment of Nepal’s top media entrepreneur is unknown, but they have already alarmed the business community. This is particularly not good in a persistently failing economy. Lowering businesspeople’s morale is the last thing we need right now when small and medium businesses are rapidly shutting down and thousands of citizens are flying abroad to work in the sweatshops of Malaysia and the Gulf states every day to keep their families alive. Does this latest action encourage people to invest or divest from the country? Doesn’t the scandalous affair of harassing a long-established and esteemed businessman based on his citizenship potentially repel possible investors from non-resident Nepali (NRN) communities? Is the government aware of this potential fallout now and in the future? Offensive to Madheshis The government has not only arrested Kailash Sirohiya but also made a deliberate attempt to create a narrative that somehow he’s a potential foreigner illegally running media companies in Nepal. This has sent a wrong signal to the public and deeply offended the Madheshi community. Nepal is highly casteist and racist. People of the southern plains bear the brunt of hill racism. They are often seen as outsiders. This stems from a longstanding policy of the ruling elites over a long period. Hundreds of thousands of Madhesis, many of them Dalits, are not only landless but also stateless. They’ve been denied citizenship even after living in the country for many generations. Frustratingly, even those Madheshis who have lived here for long and significantly contributed to society, find their belonging to the land constantly questioned. If someone like Sirohiya, who owns the largest media house in the country, and has worked to restore democracy and human rights for decades, finds himself suspected as an illegal alien, can anyone imagine the plight of ordinary Madheshis? Isn’t this shameless behaviour of the Nepali state? Has the hill racism become worse in the republican era? Concerned leaders and their blind supporters may pretend not to know anything, but people are keenly watching. Such a racist attitude of the state expressed overtly or covertly, does not bode well for our peaceful and prosperous future. Today, social media is abuzz with highly critical and racist comments against Sirohiya. The smear campaign against him has peaked. Even some Dalits have criticised me for supporting whom they say is a member of the “media mafia”, of an “Indian agent”. This is deeply disturbing. To conclude, I don’t know Kailash Sirohiya personally, but I don’t need to know him. Nor do I declare him guilty or innocent of the charges; that’s for the judges to decide. In any case, my observations don’t change as my worry is only about the attack on press freedom for narrow political interests and the implicit racist attitude of the ruling elites. I’d be equally outraged if an owner, editor, or journalist of any other media corporation were similarly targeted. Sirohiya, mentioned in this article, is the publisher of the Post. The views expressed are the author’s own. \nDisaster risk refers to exposure to hazards and vulnerability to exposed elements. The same event can impact people differently due to their pre-existing conditions, including economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age, disability, and gender. Marginalised and minority groups are generally more vulnerable and are disproportionately affected by disasters. A 2007 study, “The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981–2002”, shows that the mortality rates of women during a disaster are several times higher than that of men. Moreover, even though the life expectancy of women is higher than that of men, natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women. This suggests that women are more vulnerable than men. Such vulnerability is not based on biological or physiological differences but rather due to the socially constructed unequal gender norms that govern what roles women and men should play and how they should behave.More often than not, women are caregivers of the household. They are responsible for domestic tasks, child-bearing/rearing and caring for the elderly, sick or dependent family members. In addition, they may also be balancing work and community management roles. These roles receive little value as they do not generate income and leave women little time for income-generating activities. Consequently, women may have limited access and control over resources, undermining their decision-making power. Furthermore, social roles dictate social behaviour, such as not being able to leave home without the permission of a male family member and failing to learn or perform so-called masculine skills such as swimming or climbing trees. Due to these socially constructed constraints, women are inept and less willing to save themselves.Nepal's disaster risk reduction (DRR) and management systems have come a long way from the early reactive response-centric approaches to the current proactive approach, emphasising prevention and preparedness and increasing attention to gender-specific needs in the disaster context. Yet, they fall short of addressing vulnerabilities arising from pre-existing gendered social structures and unequal power relations, which affect people’s ability to respond to disaster and their lives in post-disaster contexts.Post-disaster, most of the relief and assistance provided to women is concerned with addressing the needs of pregnant and lactating women, distributing menstruation hygiene kits and establishing safe spaces. While these forms of relief are necessary and even life-saving, they reduce the needs of women to simply the needs associated with their reproductive and caregiving role and do not address the needs of women who do not fall under the category of being either pregnant, lactating, or menstruating.A study analysing the gendered impact of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake found that many women could not access relief or reconstruction aid because they were unable to provide the documentation (proof of citizenship, title to house/land). Similarly, many women, having been displaced by the earthquake and without any support to re-establish their livelihood, entered the entertainment sector, resorting to work in cabin restaurants and dance bars where they may be subject to sexual abuse. This notable rise in women seeking work in this sector results from conditions after the earthquake, but planners and policymakers do not generally consider it. As most support provided post-disaster is response-oriented and relief-focused and envisioned to achieve only short-term goals, this leaves out many other issues, such as access to general health care, food, shelter, livelihood opportunities and citizenships.Gender issues are considered an afterthought to the current DRR policies and practices. These policies add to the prevailing unequal institutional structure and do not challenge unequal gender relations and power structures, which is the root cause of the issue. Furthermore, DRR policies and practices are still imagined within traditionally defined gender roles, which promote and reinforce gender stereotypes.DRR policies and frameworks primarily view women as a monolithic identity, and the intersectionality within gendered experiences is largely ignored. Vulnerability is affected by many other factors, such as economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age and disability. Analysing vulnerability by considering these multiple factors and how they inter-relate reveals that not all women are equally vulnerable and that some are multiple burdened.Furthermore, DRR strategies proposed to reduce disaster risk may serve to subject women and girls to increased hardships, harassment and exploitation. A study on the impact of Covid-19 on Nepali Women reports that due to women’s role as caregivers and their overrepresentation in service and care-oriented fields, they were more vulnerable to infection. Women were also at higher risk of falling into extreme poverty during the pandemic as they were more likely than men to be working informally. Furthermore, the lockdowns added extra childcare and domestic workload, which women mostly took up. This forced women to either quit their jobs or permanently drop out of the labour force, and it most likely decreased the participation of girls in online classes and increased the rate at which girls drop out in rural areas. The lockdowns also brought about a surge in gender-based violence cases. However, due to increased attention to the pandemic, many who sought to report incidents of abuse or seek support could not access those services promptly.Similarly, a survey by WOREC found that during the pandemic, returning migrant workers were seen as transmitters of disease and faced exclusion. Moreover, women migrant workers were negatively portrayed in social media and online news portals as promiscuous, due to which they were subject to further psychological and physical harassment from their families. Even within detention centres where returning migrants were to quarantine, women were not safe from sexual assault.Even when DRR programmes in good faith recognise women’s potential to respond to disasters, this adds more responsibility to women who now, in addition to fulfilling their caregiver, reproductive and productive roles, must also act as responders to disasters or as participants in processes of reconstruction, spending time rebuilding homes, livelihoods, and communities. This additional responsibility can negatively impact their health and well-being and create a knock-on effect on their daughters’ well-being if they have to step in to help their mothers.In the article, “Sex disaggregation alone will not energize equality”, Sarah Bradshaw argues that instead of policies serving women, women now serve policy agendas where the feminisation of responsibility is a tactic to achieve multiple goals with a single project. “The ‘solution’ involves women, but it is not about women or improving women’s welfare”. Such superficial inclusion of women may improve disaster response and reduce disaster risk. However, they will not change women’s risk of disaster. Therefore, to reduce disaster risk for women, we must focus on reducing gender inequalities. \nIf you don’t have children, you are not necessarily infertile. Perhaps you don’t want one, for whatever reason. Yet the Nepali society continues to treat couples without children as odd, and somehow medically defective. And in a still highly patriarchal setup like Nepal’s, the blame for childlessness invariably falls on women. They get asked intrusive questions about their reproductive health. Often, men in such childless unions are asked to remarry so that they can have babies and take the family lineage forward. According to a 2020 study, Nepali couples are often put under pressure into having a child in the first year of their marriage, even when both husband and wife don’t want a baby. Even if one or the other member of a couple is infertile, another research in West Africa suggests, infertility in itself is not a cause for women’s anguish, it's also what is known as the Social Pressure for Pregnancy (SSP). Most women who failed to conceive cited external pressure from families and society as the main cause of their distress.As is the case in much of the world, the fertility rate in Nepal has been on a steady decline. For instance, in the two decades since 2002, there was a 50 percent dip in the country’s fertility rate. Greater awareness on family planning, increasing literacy and the rise in the number of families where both partners earn are responsible for this decline. So, again, many couples are not having children mostly out of choice. Yet women in particular continue to be under incredible social pressure to have babies, with women’s agency over their own bodies constantly undermined by their larger family and friend circles. Let’s face it, Nepal is still a men’s country where women and girls are routinely abused, verbally if not physically. When they face sexual assault, it becomes the women’s responsibility to establish guilt, even as the idea of consent is broadly defined in favour of the male perpetrator. There are far fewer women in decision-making roles, both in public and private sectors, again because of entrenched bias against women’s leadership qualities. It is hardly a surprise that whenever the chhaupadi huts are brought down in western Nepal, they come right back up. There could be no better example of society's attempt to control women, including their sexual and reproductive lives. Things are not so bad for women in urban parts of Nepal, but it is far from satisfactory. Women are expected to have more children, yet most organisations offer little in terms of maternity leave. It is good that the government is preparing to extend maternity leave to six months from the current provision of 14 weeks. Such progressive policies will help women better juggle work and family. They should also help Nepal avert the kind of sharp decline in population fast-ageing countries like Japan and China are now witnessing. But, at the end of the day, it is the women who should decide whether or not they want to have babies and how many. In a progressive society, they should get the environment to do so.   \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nIsraeli tanks advanced to the centre of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground offensive in the southern Gaza city that has stirred global condemnation for its continued civilian toll.Tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.Overnight, its forces battered the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing the offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a massive blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly.Global leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated “humanitarian zone” where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order for a halt to Israel’s assault.In another move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway were to officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday.The three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.Residents said Rafah’s Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday’s night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.“Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,” one resident told Reuters via a chat app.Around one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.A video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah’s shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.“There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We’re tired,” said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.ISRAEL SAYS IT’S IN COMBAT NEAR EGYPT BORDERSince Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet moved into the city in full force.In recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.Witnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.The Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt “based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets”.Israeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.Israel has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the top UN court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.Since Sunday’s strike on the tent camp, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said.In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.In some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins. \nThe government has outlined five key strategies and priorities for the upcoming fiscal year's budget, alongside five strategies for economic reforms.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said increasing production, productivity, and employment; increasing investment and growth and accelerating economic activities by boosting the morale of the private sector; human resource development; alleviating economic disparities and poverty through the balanced and just mobilisation of resources; and increasing the effectiveness of the public service delivery have been presented as the five objectives of the budget for the new fiscal year. Similarly, economic reforms and promotion of the private sector; building industrial infrastructure in agriculture, energy information technology sectors; promotion of social sectors such as education and health; promotion of inclusion and social security; and improvement in good governance and service delivery are declared as the five priorities of the government for the upcoming fiscal year.The five strategies for economic reforms are structural reforms; improvement in the business environment; reforms in the public finance system; financial sector reforms; and reforms in public administration. \nThe federal government is to allocate Rs567 billion to the provincial and local governments in the coming financial year 2024-25. This will be made through fiscal transfer and revenue sharing from the federal budget.According to the budget statement read out by Finance Minister Barsh Man Pun in the Parliament today, on the recommendation of the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission, the federal government has allocated Rs60 billion for the provinces and Rs88 billion for the local level towards the fiscal equalization grants.Likewise, a conditional grant worth Rs25.84 billion has been earmarked for the provinces and Rs28.88 billion for the local level.Another Rs6.2 billion has been allocated to the province and Rs7 billion rupees to the local level towards supplementary grants. In addition, Rs4.4 billion has been allocated for the province and Rs8.5 billion for the local level as a special grant.Finance Minister Pun said that arrangements will be made to transfer conditional, supplementary and special grants based on performance. The government estimates that 159 billion rupees will be transferred to the provincial and local levels as part of revenue sharing. \nTorrential rains brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's state of Mizoram, killing 15 people and trapping seven, while eight more died in landslides and other accidents elsewhere in the remote region, officials said.Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, when it killed at least 16 and cut power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.But harsh weather was hampering efforts on Tuesday to rescue at least seven people trapped in the quarry on the outskirts of Aizawl, the capital of northeastern Mizoram, disaster management officials said.“There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,” one of them told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.Seven more people were killed in landslides in Mizoram, which shares a border with Bangladesh, while a falling tree killed one person in nearby Assam, officials said, as schools and colleges shut.Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.Remal is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbours this year as climate change drives up sea surface temperatures.Many parts of coastal Bangladesh have no electricity and telecoms links, officials said, but crews were working to restore power as soon as possible.“Mass evacuations significantly reduced potential casualties, but the storm left a trail of destruction,” said disaster management chief Mijanur Rahman, adding that damages cannot be fully estimated unless communications are restored. \nThe government has allocated a Rs9.28 billion budget for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.Presenting the budget for the fiscal year 2024/25 in the joint meeting of the federal parliament on Tuesday, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the budget to the ministry has been reduced by Rs180 million.The government allocated Rs9.46 billion to the ministry's budget for the current fiscal year, and Rs10.48 billion was allocated in the earlier fiscal year.  \nThe government has announced establishing a consumer court.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun made the announcement on Tuesday while unveiling the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25. He said the necessary budget has been allocated to establish the court.“Activities like black-marketing and syndicate in the market will be controlled,” Pun said while presenting the budget, “Consumer court will also be formed. I have allocated a budget for the purpose.” \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe task force, formed to draft the terms of reference (ToR) for a parliamentary probe panel on the cooperative scams, on Tuesday agreed on the jurisdiction of the panel.The four-member task force led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri agreed on a four-point ToR for the probe committee, which will comprise seven members and has been given a three-month tenure.As per the agreement, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolution of legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision and transparency of their financial system. Likewise, the panel will also make recommendations on safeguarding the savings of the depositors, and quick and easy refunds for the victims whose deposits have been embezzled. The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.Those cooperatives that have been linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The fourth point of the agreement reads, “study on the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.”The panel will also make recommendations for appropriate disciplinary actions against all those found guilty of the crime and for the recovery of the misused deposits.According to a member of the task force, the parliamentary committee will be announced in a meeting of the House of Representatives. \nLast week, the Agriculture and Livestock Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City advised the general public to make sure that their bottled and jarred water is safe to drink. The warning was issued after municipal inspectors found algae and other particles in bottled water.“Our inspectors sent back bottled water delivery vehicles to their companies after finding issues with the water, containers, and labels,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, the chief of the department. “We will also inspect water in shops in the coming days.”The city office has no immediate plans to test the quality of water supplied to households by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, as the metropolis itself is responsible for that supply. Neupane said that his office will prioritise monitoring bottled and jar water first.Bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe. However, tests show the presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors say it is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved much.Other local units in the Valley said that they do not have the budget to regularly test the quality of water being supplied to households in their jurisdictions.“We had tested samples of drinking water collected from various sources in the past and found some problems,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “But all the budget allocated for water testing has already been used up. We can resume testing drinking water quality only after a new budget is allocated.”The Health Office Lalitpur tested the drinking water samples collected from ward 6 of Godawari Municipality in March and found them contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water used by locals of the Godawari ward is contaminated with sewage.The Lalitpur district includes the rural municipalities of Mahalaxmi, Godawari, Konjyoson, Bagmati, and Mahankal, along with Lalitpur Metropolitan City.The Nagarjun Municipality in Kathmandu also said that it does not have the budget to carry out quality testing of drinking water in the current fiscal year.“We had done water testing in the past with help from the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited,” said Krishna Bahadur Kunwar, an information officer of the municipality. “We can resume water testing only after we receive a new budget in the next fiscal year.”Although testing the drinking water used by the public is a regular responsibility of health agencies at the local level, most such agencies are unable to conduct regular testing due to insufficient budgets.Hospitals in the Valley have reported a surge in cases of diarrhoea and food poisoning recently, and contaminated water and food have been identified as the main causes. As the pre-monsoon rainfall has started, health workers say the risk of contamination has gone up.Doctors said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.Experts advise the public to ensure their water is safe for drinking. They say consuming contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera, but also increases the chances of contracting diseases like dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.According to them, launching awareness drives and ensuring access to safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases.  \nAmid the ongoing cooperative sector crisis and political turmoil, the Nepal government presents the 2024-25 budget, addressing concerns about the sustainability of the three-pillar economic model and public dissatisfaction with government performance.\nParliamentary committee's ToR remains unresolved as ruling and opposition parties clash over investigating Deputy PM Lamichhane in cooperative scam probe.\nNepali Congress and Rastriya Prajatantra Party launch protests demanding parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for alleged misuse of cooperative funds and media suppression.\nTensions escalate between ruling and opposition parties over investigation into cooperatives scam, with personal accusations being made by Rastriya Swatantra Party and Nepali Congress leaders, leading to uncertainty in the vote of trust motion for Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.\nPolitical deadlock intensifies as ruling and opposition parties clash over parliamentary probe into cooperative scam, escalating tensions over budget announcement.\nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Saturday dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Road Division Kathmandu office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work, Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media. Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The widening of the 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be carried out by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start from early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.Earlier, in January 2019, the Chinese government had handed over the 10.5 km eight-lane Koteshwar-Kalanki section of the Ring Road to the Nepal government.This is not the first time Mayor Shah has issued such a warning to the federal government and other state agencies.In April last year, the metropolis office stopped collecting garbage from Singha Durbar, the central secretariat of the federal government, and other VIP addresses such as the Office of the President at Sheetal Niwas and prime minister’s residence at Baluwatar. At the time, he had said that wasn’t a decision made on a whim but was rather a result of the “neglect, lack of responsibility and carelessness shown by the federal government”. \nAmid a rise in pre-monsoon rainfall activities, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have reported a surge in snakebites, fever, diarrhoea and jaundice cases.Doctors anticipate more cases of the ailments in the coming days, as the monsoon is about to start. This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nOver 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 will be inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) during a nationwide immunisation drive starting next Sunday.Officials said, children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.“All necessary preparations regarding IPV vaccination to the children deprived of the vaccine are being completed,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The vaccine will be administered in schools, booths and health posts.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type -2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in the South Asia region to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN Health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Gautam said that due to global shortages of the IPV vaccine, children born between April 13, 2016, and October 18, 2018, were inoculated only with the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine.“Children who missed the IPV vaccine will be at high risk of poliovirus infection,” warned Gautam. “So we are launching a campaign to inoculate them.”Health Officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.Childhood immunisation is the number one priority of the government, under which 13 types of vaccines are given against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis and typhoid under the regular immunisation programme, free of cost.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, however, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016.The Ministry of Health and Population said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. \nIndia's West Nile virus outbreak prompts Nepal to assess risk, raising concerns due to high risk of vector-borne diseases, rising temperatures, prevalence of vectors, and cross-border movement.\nRespiratory illnesses surge due to polluted air, becoming a leading global disease burden, particularly in Nepal where it shortens life expectancy by 5 years.\nNepali chef Aditya Mishra, inspired by his culinary journey and New York's Michelin-starred restaurants, established 'The Sewing Tin' supper club to elevate Nepali cuisine globally, sharing authentic dishes like kachaila and chatamari while addressing challenges and advocating for creativity in the culinary industry.\nCeleus Baral, an environmental science student, started baking during lockdown and now runs an online shop \"Bakeleus\" while promoting zero waste practices.\nPotato is a widely consumed and versatile crop in Nepal, providing essential nutrients and health benefits, though fried potato products can lead to weight gain and reduced nutritional value.\nEggs are a nutritious, protein-rich superfood with multiple health benefits, including weight loss, reduced blood pressure, and protection against infections.\nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nClimbing Nepal's towering mountains requires mental and physical resilience, proper preparation, expert guidance, and attention to safety for a successful ascent.\nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nKolkata Knight Riders lifted their third Indian Premier League (IPL) title with an eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in a lop-sided final in Chennai on Sunday.Kolkata, who topped the group stage of the 10-team league, had beaten Hyderabad in the first qualifier on Tuesday and were even more dominant in the summit clash, which lasted 29 overs.Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins was left to rue his decision to bat first as his side got skittled out for 113 runs in 18.3 overs.Player-of-the-match Mitchell Starc produced a double strike while his new ball partner Vaibhav Arora dismissed the dangerous Travis Head for a first ball duck to rattle Hyderabad.Kolkata’s talismanic all-rounder Andre Russell claimed three crucial wickets, including those of South African Aiden Markram and rival captain Cummins, as Hyderabad wilted inside 19 overs.Defending the lowest total in an IPL final, Cummins removed Sunil Narine in the second over but the miracle they needed did not materialise.Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed an unbeaten 52 off 26 balls, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39) helped Kolkata romp home in 10.3 overs in front of a sea of purple jerseys that included franchise co-owner and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.“No words to describe (the feeling). It means so much,” West Indies stalwart Russell said wiping away tears.“I am happy that all of us were very disciplined and worked towards one goal. This franchise has done a lot for me. It's a big gift from all of us to them.”It was a special night for Kolkata mentor Gautam Gambhir, who captained the franchise to IPL titles in 2012 and 2014.“I thought they (Kolkata) bowled fantastically. Obviously not enough (from Hyderabad) tonight... They didn’t give us anything,” Cummins said of his side’s batting effort.“It was a tricky wicket. I didn’t feel it was like a 200-plus wicket. I think 160 would have given us a chance.”Royal Challengers Bengaluru crashed out in the playoffs but stalwart Virat Kohli won the orange cap as the league’s leading scorer with 741 runs from 15 matches.Punjab Kings seamer Harshal Patel won the purple cap for the league’s most successful bowler with 24 wickets from 14 matches even though his team did not make the playoffs.Kolkata’s Narine was adjudged the season’s Most Valuable Player for his all-round brilliance. \nThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday said it has requested the prime minister and the foreign ministry to take initiatives to help Sandeep Lamichhane get a US visa.The Embassy of the United States of America in Nepal had denied visa to Lamichhane, who is preparing to travel to the country and the West Indies to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.Lamichhane took to social media to to say his visa application had been rejected.“And the US Embassy, Nepal did it again like they did back in 2019, they denied my visa for the T20 World Cup happening in the US and the West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well wishers of Nepal Cricket,” Lamichhane wrote.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments as the country’s cricket governing body lifted his suspension, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape conviction by a district court.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.The Kathmandu District Court on December 29, 2023 convicted Lamichhane of raping a girl and sentenced him to eight years in prison on January 11.He was cleared to play following the verdict.“We have already requested the prime minister, the foreign ministry and other stakeholders to take initiatives in getting Lamichhane a visa for the US,” Chatur Bahadur Chand, the CAN president, told the Post.“The visa was rejected despite the application being attached with the high court’s order and letters from the International Cricket Council and CAN,” Chand added.“It is a matter of concern for the country. But we are hopeful he will get a visa.”The US Embassy said they could not comment on individual visa cases.“The US Embassy is extremely excited to have Nepal's men’s national cricket team, the Rhinos, participating in the T20 World Cup in the United States and, in fact, a few Embassy officials met with them a few weeks ago to appreciate and encourage them before they headed out. We are wishing the entire team the best in the coming games,” the US Embassy said.“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”CAN has reached out to the ICC to include Lamichhane in Nepal’s T20 World Cup squad.Lamichhane has been training regularly at the TU Cricket Ground.It is not the first time the US has denied him a visa. Lamichhane’s visa application was rejected by the US in 2019 for the Caribbean Premier League. He had taken the issue to Twitter (now X) to express his dissatisfaction over the visa denial. However, a few hours after his post, the embassy had called Lamichhane and given him a visa.Nepal had already announced their provisional 15-man squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.The Nepali team are already in the West Indies and have been training in St Vincent. ICC allows all 20 participating teams of the global showpiece to make changes and submit their final squad until May 25.The Rhinos played a three-match T20 practice series against Windwards Volcanoes, which they won 2-1. They will play warm-up matches against Canada and the US on May 27 and May 30 before launching their World Cup campaign against the Netherlands on June 4.Nepal are making their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nUS Embassy in Kathmandu denies visa to Nepal cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane, preventing him from participating in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup despite his acquittal in a rape case.\nAmidst a heatwave likely worsened by climate change, Pakistan's Sindh province recorded the summer's highest temperature of 52.2°C, approaching the country's record and significantly impacting daily life and businesses.\nIsraeli airstrike kills 35 in Gaza, sparking condemnation as Israel maintains offensive despite international outcry and UN ruling demanding halt.\nA massive landslide in Papua New Guinea has buried over 2,000 people, with treacherous terrain and instability hindering rescue efforts and raising concerns about survivor prospects.\nUnauthorized translations and pirated books by renowned authors, including Taslima Nasrin, are prevalent in Nepal's book market, raising concerns about copyright infringement, poor quality translations, and the harm to authors, readers, and the publishing industry.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn our previous article, \"Regulatory gaps in Nepal’s fintech\" (March 14, 2024), we discussed some regulatory gaps in fintech. In this piece, we will focus on the regulatory gaps primarily related to cybersecurity and data protection that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must quickly address. The fintech ecosystem in Nepal is growing, but it remains fragile in terms of cybersecurity and data protection. The NRB regulation should promote fintech innovation while also considering the importance of data protection and security.Technology is evolving, and so are cyber-attacks. In 2019, hackers stole almost Rs18.9 million from 13 Nepali banks using ATM terminals. They spoofed the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Limited (NEPS) link using fake cards, which enabled them to take money from the ATMs by independently verifying all the information of the Nepal bank's clients. This incident was one of the most prominent cases of cross-banking transactions via ATM cash-out hack and could happen again. Hence, the NRB should be aware of such incidents. The court decided to punish the perpetrators; however, as it wasn’t physical loot, a detailed investigation to find out the root cause would have been an appropriate step by the central bank. Such investigations could provide insights and further strengthen the system security of such companies and bank and financial institutions in Nepal.Clause 44 of the Payment and Settlement Bylaw, 2077 (First Amendment, 2080) addresses the liability of the payment system operators (PSO)/payment service providers (PSP) in case of any disputes or any other loss arising from incidents such as cyber-attacks. However, the absence of explicit guidance regarding the extent of liability raises concerns. For instance, a PSO with a paid-up capital of Rs50 million must be given clear guidelines on their liability in the worst-case scenario, or there must be a limit on how much of their customers’ funds they can retain. Additionally, it is the right time to introduce a government guarantee fund, like the deposit and credit guarantee fund (DCGF), to protect the public from loss arising from data breaches and other cyber incidents. If the government had set up such funds, it would have been more vigilant and strict on cybersecurity measures. This would be a win-win situation for all parties.Furthermore, no insurance products are available in Nepal to hedge companies against any loss due to data breaches or similar security incidents. The lack of insurance coverage leaves companies vulnerable to hacking and losses. It might be appropriate for the regulator to open a pathway for companies in Nepal to obtain cyber insurance, even from foreign companies, until insurance companies in Nepal launch such products.Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw and Directive No. 3 of the NRB Unified Directive Related to Payment Systems, 2079, discusses the security policies and practices for PSO/PSP. Implementing a uniform requirement for payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27,000 certifications across all financial institutions involved in payment processing would ensure a data protection baseline, mitigating the risks of cyber threats. The language of the Directive is clear: A licensed institution shall adhere to the standards of PCI DSS, Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) Standard, EMV Contactless Standard, etc. However, a mechanism to ensure that these standards are followed is unclear. Had it been mentioned that certification like PCI DSS is mandatory, it would have made more sense since an independent third party always issues a certification. Similarly, regulatory requirements always act as the baseline for security, and these NRB guidelines are the minimum requirements spread across the industry. Further, data security is not a matter of securing them for a point of time only; it is a regular, ongoing activity that needs the attention of the stakeholders. Similarly, if we look through most payment-related companies’ websites, except for a few big players, we don’t find much information related to their security and related certifications.A provision requiring each licensed institution to disclose its licenses and certifications, commitment to data security, and other related matters on its website and update it regularly must be introduced to increase public awareness and invoke dialogues between the stakeholders. Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw contains a provision for system audit while it also mentions a provision for an annual system audit. In contrast, the Directive states that a system audit is mandatory after a year of operation and every two years when there are no changes in the existing system. These two provisions contradict each other, and the regulator must provide clarification on the same. Two years to conduct a system audit is pretty long, and so payment-related institutions must conduct at least an annual system audit in light of the rise of cyber threats in the present context.Awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity is a pressing need today since most occur due to human negligence. Social engineering is the most common way through which intruders can gather data and find loopholes in a payment system. To improve cyber risk measures, visibility is required on the organisation's risk dashboard, covering all inherent risk levels to provide a picture of what is being defended. Lastly, continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to risk management is the only way against cyber-attacks. The country’s payment industry is still in its infancy, and before something worse happens, all the stakeholders must join hands to protect the public’s interest. \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe emergence of a leader is possible through hard work, confidence, determination, ideas and identification with issues. Leaders are created by movements, long democratic practices and immediate events triggered by people’s frustration and anger. However, instant leaders are short-lived and fade away after they fail to imbibe perseverance, commitment and the qualities of being patient. Such leaders are soon seduced by power and privileges as their role is made for the time being. In Nepal, many ambitious youth have shown the characteristics of instant leaders who are easily exposed and stigmatised. Watching the Indian political scene for the last few years, it seems that it is the coming of age of Rahul Gandhi. Sooner or later, he will likely play a crucial role in Indian politics. Rahul’s rise is possible not because he happened to be a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family but because of his dedication, perseverance, hard work and the ability to be closer to the people of India. Rather than being elitist, he is perceived as people-centred and egalitarian in his mission and actions, contrary to his aristocratic family background. Rahul is evolving as a leader despite the humiliation and insinuation hurled at him by his opponents.His mission to unify India, accept unity in the diversity of Indian society and polity, and his steadfast commitment to safeguarding the Republican constitution by finding suitable guardrails have paid him rich dividends in recent elections. Whatever the results, he has surpassed all other country leaders, endearing himself to ordinary people. Born with a silver spoon, Rahul has unique personality traits. He has the knack of being humble; sometimes, he finds himself in ordinary train compartments, travelling with fellow travellers, shaving his beard in an ordinary salon in Rae Bareli, eating chhole-bhature in Delhi street, mixing with kids while undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra, or taking sweets in an ordinary shop somewhere in South India. These activities make him the darling of the masses. Narendra Damodar Modi, now the Prime Minister, by contrast, also has the humble background of being the son of a tea-seller at the Gujrat railway station and has emerged as a charismatic leader over time. Nevertheless, the taste of power that he enjoyed as a long-time chief minister of Gujrat and later as the country leader for over a decade seems to have transformed him into an elitist leader with a disposition for a luxurious life. However, Modi continues to be popular among his colleagues and has become the only star campaigner for his party during the three parliamentary elections in 2014, 2019 and 2024. Weary and exhausted, Modi’s charisma is declining due to his age and failure to deliver on the people’s basic needs. Moreover, India today is a highly polarised country, as the BJP government is criticised for using religion as a weapon to scare minorities, especially Muslims. The Hindutwa agenda is interpreted as the divisive doctrine propounded and practised by orthodox BJP leaders. Contrarily, Rahul has taken up this agenda, arguing that he wants to propagate love, not hatred, as he has been repeating since his long march from the deep South to Kashmir and Manipur to Maharastra. He has assured the people that he would not allow the constitution, which embraces the “unity in diversity” principle, to be destroyed. Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    \nNepal on Wednesday and Thursday held an international dialogue on climate issues of mountainous countries. Titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change,” it saw the participation of representatives from 23 countries gathered to strengthen coordination among mountain countries on climate change-related issues. The dialogue has been instrumental in positioning mountains at the centre of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On Thursday itself, 22 people from Madhesh reached Kathmandu after a 25-day walk, calling for saving the Chure mountains. They have come with a 12-point charter of demands, which include saving the water sources, jungles and mountains in the Chure region apart from protecting the land itself.One of the most fragile mountain ranges in South Asia, the Chure range consists of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. Around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long, the range is a lifeline for the Madhesh region, providing water, minerals and vegetation. However, the water sources originating from the foothills of Chure have dried up in recent years due to exploitation, leading to the depletion of the first layer of the underground water in the Bhawar and Madhesh regions. The depletion of water has already impacted people in Madhesh, with ponds, tube wells and hand pumps running dry.The culprits of the degradation of Chure are all too familiar: The sand, land and timber mafia that is only interested in making a profit and the three tiers of government that have no regard for the present and future of the nation and its citizens. But there has been little effort to stop the exploitation of the fragile mountains. As the Chure continues to turn into a desert, we are staring at a significant crisis of water and food scarcity.The President Chure-Tarai Madhes Conservation Area Programme has been making some significant interventions, especially related to water conservation, building ponds and irrigation channels. But these efforts have been too slow and inadequate considering the rapid deforestation and extraction in the region. The campaigners who have marched to Kathmandu say the foremost work the governments of all levels must do is to shut down the crusher and sand mining industries in the region. Moreover, they demand that the government declare Dilip Mahato, an activist who was killed by illegal sand miners, as the “First environmental martyr” of Nepal. What is significant about these campaigners is that they are not just activists speaking for an environmental cause, but victims of the impacts of environmental damage and face risks to their lives. The government must, therefore, listen to their demands and act to fulfil them.The campaigners for saving the Chure plan sit-ins at different places in Kathmandu—the common protest site at Maitighar as well as the offices of various political parties. The central government in Kathmandu, which is often too quick in manhandling protesters of all kinds, would do well to listen to the campaigners this time. They have come up with a message that is important not only for themselves but for the entire nation. The degradation of Chure impacts us all, and if we do not listen to the campaigners and act on time, we will be staring at a bleak future. \nAir pollution has plunged the world into a global public health crisis, and Nepal is no exception. The air we inhale for survival is one of the leading causes of illness, as reported by The Lancet, a medical journal. Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have become all too common now. Besides these, ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases, heart problems, and so on are attributed to bad air. The vulnerability of children, women, the elderly and underrepresented groups to air pollution adds to the urgency of its mitigation.The impact of toxic air is particularly harsh on Nepalis as our federal capital, Kathmandu, often tops the list of most polluted cities globally. Only a few weeks ago, Pokhara Metropolitan City’s air was unbreathable for several days. The southern plains met the same fate. This poor air quality has reduced our life expectancy by a staggering 4.6 years, as per the report by the Air Quality Life Index of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The situation is worse in nine southern districts (Mahottari, Rautahat, Dhanusha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha and Rupandehi). These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  \nHome Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Tuesday committed a gross abuse of his authority by sending Nepal Police to have Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which publishes The Kathmandu Post, arrested. Sirohiya was at work as police officers barged into his office at the KMG headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu.We have no objection with law enforcement officers fulfilling their duty as per the law of the land, and are committed to fully supporting the state in an impartial investigation on the alleged discrepancies in Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate. However, we are also cognisant of the politics of vendetta being pursued against Sirohiya by Home Minister Lamichhane, who has been riled by the consistent, fact-based reporting of Kantipur, our sister publication, on his alleged involvement in cooperative frauds.Coming on the heels of the persistent calls for a parliamentary probe into his alleged frauds, Lamichhane has made no secret of his intention to play the politics of vendetta against the KMG. This is not the first time Lamichhane has launched an attack against the group. Over a year ago, as he struggled to salvage his image in the wake of the case against dual citizenship, Lamichhane opened a barrage of unsubstantiated allegations against KMG. That Lamichhane has a grudge against the group for fulfilling its duty of fearless, factual reporting is thus well-documented.But the home minister’s action against KMG should not be taken as a singular event. It is, rather, an attack on press freedom through the misuse of state machinery, and it is going to set a dangerous precedent. It is ironic that Lamichhane, a former mediaperson, has taken an authoritarian approach of punishing another mediaperson for unfavourable reporting about him. In having Sirohiya arrested, Lamichhane has exposed his undemocratic character as a politician.Sirohiya’s arrest takes us back to the early 2000s, when press freedom was at an awfully low point. In 2001, the then government had arrested Kantipur Publications publishers Kailash Sirohiya and Binod Raj Gyawali as well as Kantipur Editor-In-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire on the grounds of publishing an opinion article that it considered “objectionable”. Later, in 2005, when King Gyanendra Shah imposed dictatorial rule, he sent the country's army and police forces to the newsrooms of Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, along with dozens of other newsrooms in the Kathmandu valley and elsewhere in the country to ensure that no negative news about the government could be published. Over almost three decades of its service to the nation, the private media houses in Nepal, with Kantipur Publications at its head, have repeatedly stood up to injustices and defended the rights of the citizens—and they will continue to report on corruption cases such as the one the home minister is embroiled in. The politics of vendetta and fear has never worked in favour of authoritarian regimes, and it will not work this time around. The Nepali media has never bowed down to the politics of fear and, rest assured, we will continue to fulfil our duty of informing the citizens without fear or favour.  \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nThe government and the main opposition Nepali Congress have reached an understanding on the terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary probe panel on the cooperatives scam. They came to an agreement during a meeting of the leaders of four major parties on Monday evening.Though three parties—the Congress, the CPN-UML and the Rastriya Swatantra Party—had agreed to constitute a parliamentary committee on May 18 and formed a task force to draft the panel’s terms of reference (TOR), the task force struggled to finalise the terms due to conflicting stances of the ruling and opposition parties. Now the Rastriya Prajatantra Party has also come on board. While the party is not represented in the task force, it will have representation in the parliamentary probe committee. According to the members of the task force, with Monday’s understanding, the government will be able to present the annual budget on Tuesday. “We have agreed, in principle, on the terms of reference for the parliamentary committee,” said Ramesh Lekhak, chief whip of the Nepali Congress. “The House will also resume Tuesday.”The understanding comes on the eve of the budget presentation day. Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun will present the annual budget for 2024-25 at a joint session of Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. The main opposition Congress, which has been obstructing the House to put pressure on the government to form the parliamentary panel, had earlier threatened to obstruct budget presentation on Tuesday if the ruling parties continued to ignore its demand.“Some details of the TOR will be discussed and agreed on during a meeting tomorrow morning,” Sishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, who represents the party in the task force, told the Post.Jeevan Pariyar and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki from the Nepali Congress; Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri and Mahesh Bartaula of the CPN-UML, and Khanal from the RSP are the members of the task force mandated to chart out the parliamentary committee’s terms of reference. According to Congress sources, there has been an agreement to form a seven-member parliamentary committee to look into the misuse of funds in several cooperatives including those based in Pokhara, Butwal and Bharatpur (Chitwan). The Nepali Congress has been accusing Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane of obtaining loans illegally from three cooperatives based on these cities to fund his television channel, Gorkha Media Network, which is now defunct. “We are very close to an agreement that we will make it public tomorrow,” said Padam Giri, minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs. “A meeting of the task force will sit tomorrow morning and give final touches to the ToR.”As agreed among the parties, the ToR will specifically mention the names of Surya Darshan Cooperatives of Kaski, Sahara Cooperatives of Chitwan and Supreme Cooperatives of Butwal, all of which have been linked to the home minister Lamichanne but are owned by GB Rai, who used to run the Gorkha Media Network.  “Then we will initiate a probe into the financial embezzlement in these cooperatives and a few others,” said a Nepali Congress leader. “Home Minister Lamichhane’s name will not be mentioned in the ToR. But the parties have agreed to probe financial embezzlement that took place in the Gorkha Media Network.” The home minister had reportedly drawn millions of rupees in loans from three cooperatives while he served as the managing director of the Gorkha Media Network.Parties had agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives, and financial embezzlement in the three cooperatives, but the ruling parties emphatically rejected the opposition’s demand for inclusion of the home minister’s name in the TOR.Billions of rupees were illegally transferred from several cooperatives to fund the Gorkha Media Network. The funds were syphoned off by GB Rai, who used to run the three cooperatives based in Pokhara, Chitwan and Butwal and ran the now defunct Galaxy 4K television. “Although no names will be mentioned in the TOR,” said Giri, “if any financial foul play is discovered in the running of the Gorkha Media Network, legal action will be recommended for the culprit.” According to the Nepali Congress and UML’s leaders, the seven-member task force will initially be given at least three months to complete the investigation, subject to renewal if it cannot complete its task on time.As per the understanding, two members each from the Congress and the UML and one each from the CPN (Maoist Centre), the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party will be members of the parliamentary panel. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was active throughout Monday in order to find common ground and was busy meeting leaders from both ruling and opposition parties. In case there was no agreement, the Congress leaders had threatened to obstruct the house and disturb the finance minister’s budget presentation. It was the Congress that first raised the demand for the formation of the parliamentary committee after Rabi Lamichhane was appointed deputy prime minister and home minister on March 6. \nThe Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended the remand of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya by three days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.On Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own.On Saturday, police in Dhanusha interrogated Kashiraj Dahal, who was an administrative officer in the district 24 years ago, on the issue. During the interrogation, Dahal said the sign on Sirohiya’s citizenship copy was his own and was issued based on the original document.The extension of judicial custody comes despite national and international media organisations, rights bodies, business fraternity and leaders condemning the arrest. Protest programmes have been organised in various districts of Madhesh Province, including Dhanusha, demanding Sirohiya’s immediate release.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after Indrajit Mahato, a cadre of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s Rastriya Swatantra Party, filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.Sirohiya is currently undergoing treatment at the Janakpur-based Kavya Hospital following heart-related problems.Police arrested Sirohiya and started investigation stating that another person Shivaji Sahu Teli also has a citizenship certificate with the same number.Chief District Officer Ramuraj Kadariya and Superintendent of Police Bhuwaneshwar Tiwari have allegedly kept Teli, who ekes out a living as a rickshaw puller, under pressure. They have instructed him not to meet anyone or talk to them. The local administration has deployed some detectives to monitor Teli's activities.The investigation officers reached Teli’s residence and quizzed him a few days ago. He was also summoned to the District Police Office for inquiry.Earlier, the Post had made several attempts to meet Teli for reporting, but was unsuccessful. The Post was finally able to meet a panic-stricken Teli, along with his wife Pawandevi Sahu, on Monday.“Police have told me not to meet or talk to anyone. I am under stress. My health has worsened and I have been suffering from anxiety,” said Teli, an asthma patient. Teli said that in the past few days he had been unable to go to the city to operate his rickshaw.  \nEight of 10 local units of Achham, a remote hill district in Sudurpaschim Province, laid foundations for the construction of basic hospitals four years ago as part of the federal government’s ambitious plan to build a hospital in every local unit across the country.The local people were hopeful of receiving quality health services in their own local units. However, four years on, the federal project remains incomplete in the district.Ramaroshan Rural Municipality has not yet initiated the construction work to build the hospital building. Deepak Khanal, the information officer at the rural municipality, said that the rural municipality failed to proceed with any work for the hospital construction due to a dispute regarding the construction site.“The rural municipality had invited a tender for hospital construction before the local elections of 2022 but nobody submitted a bid then,” Khanal said. “New people’s representatives were elected soon after that. The rural municipality has not taken any decision regarding the construction of the hospital building.”With an objective of providing basic health services to the people, the federal government in the annual budget for the fiscal year 2019-20 had announced plans to construct one hospital each in all 753 local units of the country. On November 30, 2020, the people’s representatives had laid the foundation stones to construct five- to 15-bed hospitals in 396 local units simultaneously across the country with a plan to complete the project within two years.There already are two hospitals in the district—the district hospital in Mangalsen Municipality and the Bayalpata Hospital in Sanphebagar Municipality.For the construction of a basic hospital at a local level, the approval of that local unit concerned and the recommendation of the district coordination committee is required. For the construction of a five-bed hospital, 5.6 ropani [0.28 hectares] of land and 7.2 ropani [0.37 hectares] of land for the construction of a 10-bed and 15-bed hospital are needed, with a clear description of that land in the land ownership certificate.After the land is secured, the detailed project report for the hospital should be prepared and submitted to the Ministry of Health and Population, and a budget is only allocated after the ministry approves the initial report.The construction of a 10-bed hospital, which has been started in Turmakhand Rural Municipality, has not yet been completed.Ekendra Bayak, head of the health unit at Turmakhand Rural Municipality, said that an agreement was signed with a construction company. But despite multiple deadline extensions, the construction remains incomplete. The last deadline expires at the end of the current fiscal year.“It seems impossible to complete the construction by the end of the current fiscal year, and locals are outrageous about it,” said Bayak. “There is a dire need for a hospital in the rural municipality because the existing Turmakhand Health Post is in a dilapidated condition.”Jhanakraj Dhungana, head of the Achham Health Office, said that the hospitals are being built from federal government funds, and once the construction contract is issued, it is the responsibility of the local unit concerned to monitor and regulate the work.“The local units are the ones that awarded the contracts and are responsible for starting the work. If anything goes wrong, it is the local unit’s responsibility,” said Dhungana.Nandaram Budha, a local of ward 4 of Turmakhand Rural Municipality, said that local officials complain that the construction company does not work on time, while the construction company blames the local unit. And as such, locals who will benefit from it are puzzled as to whose fault exactly it is.“After hearing that there is going to be a hospital in our local unit, all the locals were thrilled because we only have a health post, and sick people were forced to make an arduous journey on foot to the district hospital,” Budha said. “But now I doubt our dream will come true.”The 15-bed hospital in Chaurpati Rural Municipality has also not been completed.Dhan Bahadur Thapa, chief administrative officer of the Chaurpati Rural Municipality, said that an agreement was signed with a construction company at a cost of Rs120 million three years ago to complete the work within two years of time.“We already gave the construction company one extension, and as per the government regulations, we can grant another if needed. So far, the groundwork and foundation have been completed, and the deadline will end on May 28,” said Thapa. “A meeting will soon be held with the company to discuss the issue.”Hikmat Bahadur Budha, chief administrative officer of Mellekh Rural Municipality, said that the construction of the hospital will be completed, but the real challenge will come after that.“Although the federal government has provided the budget for the construction, the government has not said anything about essential manpower and equipment, among other things,” Budha said. \nThe floor of Parliament during the budget presentation has been a perennial battleground of Nepali politics.In recent years, the budget presentation has been chaotic including some instances of physical altercations. To announce the budget, the lawmakers have had to be controlled by marshals. And this drama may play out this year too.The ongoing feud between the ruling and opposition parties over forming a parliamentary inquiry committee on the misappropriation of cooperative savings may have spillover effects on the budget, which once again may be introduced through ordinances on Tuesday.Nepal’s economy, still reeling from the fallout of the pandemic and global geopolitics, is facing an increasingly gloomy and uncertain outlook due to frequent government changes, rampant corruption and irregularities, and the exodus of youths who see no future in the country.Many of the downside risks flagged by economists have begun to materialise.Experts say that aside from economic considerations, Nepal’s unstable national politics could also cause problems for the economy.Some key data released a few weeks ago confirm that Nepal’s construction and manufacturing sector is still in recession. The wholesale and retail sector has avoided the recession while tourism and agriculture have grown slightly. Economists say the country’s economy is doing badly. As industries are producing less, more people are going jobless. “If lawmakers give low or no priority to bringing the annual budget in the current situation, it will further drag down economic growth,” said Chandramani Adhikari, an economist.“What is happening currently is not healthy politics. In Parliament, the ongoing politics is more centred on individual interest.” “If political parties were serious about the country, the principles and priorities of the budget would have been discussed,” Adhikari said. “The budget would have been presented easily, well-discussed, reviewed and approved.”Even the policies and programmes were delayed and not even discussed, Adhikari said.Economists say that uncertain budget execution dashes hopes of the entire population. Opposition parties have demanded a parliamentary probe on the misappropriation of cooperatives savings, particularly pointing the index finger at the incumbent Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, which the ruling alliance is reluctant to initiate. But this is not the first controversy related to corruption and irregularities that has marred ruling-opposition relations.Nepal’s economic reforms in the 1990s promised a liberal market-based economy, but even after three and a half decades, successive governments have shown little favour towards private businesses.“Crony capitalism distorts the efficiency of a free market. Yet Nepal is in the clutches of crony capitalism where limited people, families and communities benefit,” said Adhikari. Protecting them will only stir up power struggles in politics, bulldozing the hopes and aspirations of the people, he said. Economist Keshav Acharya said that when the budget comes under political pressure, nobody will take its ownership. Past experiences have shown that the budget undergoes numerous revisions with each new government coming to power. “The ongoing politics is weighing heavily on the economy. On the eve of the budget presentation, we are uncertain how it is coming. Will it be through ordinances or common consensus?” Acharya said. “Such uncertainty is not helpful when it comes to meeting the budget’s objectives.” Nepal's private sector contributes over 80 percent to the GDP, making it a crucial driver of economic growth. However, due to the fragile political system, investors have pulled back on investment.The annual spending of the three tiers of government stands at a combined Rs500 billion. The private sector pumps four times more into the national economy. Hem Raj Regmi, the deputy chief statistician at the National Statistics Office, recently told a press conference that under the current investment model, the total investment amounts to Rs2.5 trillion. “At this investment rate, Nepal’s economic growth will neither slow down nor grow. It will remain static.”He said that without encouraging private investment, Nepal will not be able to achieve double-digit economic growth. “We need to increase expenditure. We need to encourage the private sector to invest.”Rajesh Kumar Agrawal, president of the Confederation of Nepalese Industries, said the private sector wants the bureaucracy and the policies to be stable. “Governments changing every six months will not be a problem if policies remain constant.”“The fiscal budget is a policy document to drive the economy. The private sector mainly looks for stable policies and their implementation.”The Nepali economy has historically been stuck in a low-growth trap in the past decades due to a decade-long Maoist insurgency followed by strikes, shutdowns, load-shedding, and earthquakes.Nepal in 2015 was struck by two powerful earthquakes of magnitudes 7.8 and 7.3 on April 25 and May 12, respectively, killing 8,790 people and injuring 22,300. The economic loss was estimated at $7 billion, out of which 76 percent was in the private sector.Following the disaster, Nepal’s economic growth rate plunged to 3.98 percent in the fiscal year 2014-15 and decelerated further to 0.43 percent in 2015-16.But since then, a flurry of post-disaster activities led to a breakneck speed of growth. The Nepali economy grew by 8.98 percent in the fiscal year 2016-17, the highest growth rate since the fiscal year 1993-94.In 2017-18, the economy grew by 7.62 percent and 6.66 percent in 2018-19, according to the National Statistics Office, formerly the Central Bureau of Statistics, the main government body that deals with the country's vital statistics.The worst came in 2019-20 when the world was hit by the Covid pandemic. The pandemic-induced supply and demand shock on the global economy caused Nepal's economy to plunge to a negative 2.37 percent.According to the World Bank, this was Nepal's first annual negative growth rate since 1982-1983, when its economic growth rate plummeted to -2.97 percent.The statistics office then attributed the negative growth rate to a drought in 1980-81, which in turn led to a severe food crisis.Nepal’s economy, which rebounded strongly after Covid, has been marred by political instability and haphazard decisions to gain short-term benefits, economists say.“There is politics everywhere, but that hardly affects most of the country’s economy. In Nepal, if the politics is unstable, the bureaucracy follows suit. That’s a bane for Nepalis and the economy,” said Acharya, the economist.  \nNepal’s cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane still has a chance to join Nepal’s squad in the United States and the West Indies for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup if he obtains a visa from the United States.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) has submitted the list of only 14 players to the International Cricket Council (ICC) for the World Cup, leaving one slot for leg spinner Lamichhane.All 20 participating teams had a May 25 deadline to submit their 15-man squad for the World Cup, including change in the provisional 15-member squad.“We have sent a list of only 14 players to the ICC for now because we still hope Lamichhane will get a visa from the US Embassy,” CAN President Chatur Bahadur Chand told the Post.Last week, the US Embassy in Nepal denied a visa to Lamichhane which has jeopardised his hopes to participate in the World Cup.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments by the country’s cricket governing body, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.Nepal had already announced their provisional squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.“The ICC has already approved our request to include Lamichhane in the final 15-member World Cup squad,” Chand added. “If Lamichhane receives a visa in a few days, he will be included in the squad.”CAN will required approval from ICC’s event technical committee to make changes in Nepal’s squad.However, CAN has not yet revealed the name of the player who was not included in the list of the 14 players submitted to the ICC.If Lamichhane does not get a US visa, the 15 players currently in the team will play the World Cup, according to Chand.“We have requested the government to clarify the situation regarding Lamichhane to the US Embassy and make the environment favourable to Lamichhane,” Chand further said. “We hope he gets a visa because it is what our cricket fans want.”Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York, while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nKantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya was flown to Kathmandu on Tuesday for further treatment.Sirohiya, who was admitted to the Kavya Hospital in Janakpur after experiencing heart-related problems on May 25, was brought to the Capital at around 3:30 pm and has been taken to the Nepal Mediciti Hospital, Lalitpur. The KMG Chair, who had fallen sick since last Thursday, was admitted to the Janakpur-based hospital after he had a headache, high blood pressure and fluctuating heartbeat.According to Navin Kumar, a member of the board of advisors for Nepal Mediciti Hospital, Sirohiya is in the emergency ward and his essential tests are being conducted.“The doctors will brief him on his condition once the test reports come,” Kumar said.Sirohiya is in police custody in connection with the investigation after a cadre of Rastriya Swatantra Party of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane filed a complaint stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person’s citizenship certificate.The Dhanusha District Court on Monday extended his remand by three more days.A single bench of Judge Yaduraj Sharma allowed the district police office to keep Sirohiya in custody until Wednesday for further investigation.Previously on Friday, the court had extended his remand for three days. Police presented him before the court on Monday to have his remand extended. After an hours-long hearing, Judge Sharma had extended the remand by three days.The police asked the court to extend the remand, saying the signature on Sirohiya’s citizenship mentioning the date of birth has been sent for forensic test and the report is awaited.Police on May 21 arrested Sirohiya, weeks after RSP cadre Indrajit Mahato filed a complaint at the District Police Office in Dhanusha stating that the number on Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate was the same as that on another person Shivaji Sahu Teli’s citizenship certificate.The then administrative officer of the Dhanusha District Administration Office has said the signature on the copy of the citizenship certificate is authentic and his own. \nThe House of Representatives on Tuesday formed a seven-member parliamentary committee to investigate cooperative fraud.Speaker Devraj Ghimire announced the formation of the committee at the meeting of the lower house.The committee is headed by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa.Members include Sarita Bhusal of UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Nepali Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.Earlier today, the task force formed to draft the terms of reference (ToR) for a parliamentary probe panel on cooperative scams agreed on the panel’s jurisdiction.The committee was formed as per the demand of the main opposition Nepali Congress that had been demanding such a committee to probe cooperative fraud and had even been obstructing parliamentary proceedings demanding the same. The parliament had seen prolonged deadlock as the ruling and opposition parties had differing views over the jurisdiction of the committee.The main opposition party demanded that the name of Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane should be mentioned in the committee’s jurisdiction as he was allegedly involved in the embezzlement of millions of rupees from multiple cooperatives while he headed the Gorkha Media Network before joining the politics. But the ruling parties, mainly the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane and the CPN-UML, strongly opposed the proposal to specifically mention his name. After weeks-long negotiations, the two sides agreed to mention the name of the media company and remain silent about his name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. \nThe government has announced to prioritise reservoir-based hydroelectric projects.Presenting the budget for the upcoming fiscal year in Parliament, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said that construction of hydropower projects with large generation capacity will be started. He said the construction of the 1200 MW Budhigandaki Hydropower Project and the 1061 MW Upper Arun Hydropower Project would be started. He also said the government would start construction of the Nalagad, Jagdulla, and Naumure multipurpose hydropower projects.The minister said the construction of 77.5 MW Ghunsa and 70 MW Ghunsa Khola hydropower projects would be funded with the investment from the Nepalis in foreign employment.He announced that the government would start the construction of the 783 MW Sunkoshi III hydropower project.The government aims to connect 100 MW of solar projects from the private sector to the national grid. \nThe government has allocated almost Rs12 billion for the tourism sector.Unveiling the budget for fiscal 2024-25, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said that a budget of Rs11.91 billion has been earmarked for the Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation.Pun also said that the government aims to welcome 1.6 million tourists in the upcoming fiscal year.The finance minister also announced plans to facilitate foreign tourists who come to Nepal for wedding ceremonies in a bid to promote various cultural and tourist destinations within the country as wedding destinations.The government will also lease government lands to the private sector for hotel construction to increase the number of tourists.Roadways, electricity and water facilities will be provided to such buildings via cooperation between the local and provincial governments, Pun added.A budget of Rs5.46 billion has also been allocated to improve tourism infrastructure, such as repairing roadways and establishing tourist rescue centres in potential risk-prone areas, among others. The amount will be spent through the Tourism Department. \nFinance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Tuesday announced a Rs1.86 trillion budget estimate for the fiscal year 2024-25.The budget size for the next fiscal year 2024-25, beginning mid-July, is 6.2 percent more than the unrevised budget of the current fiscal year. The government had allocated Rs1.75 trillion budget for the fiscal year 2023-24.Addressing a joint session of the Parliament on Tuesday, Minister Pun said that the recurrent expenditure has been estimated to be Rs1.14 trillion, which is 61.31 percent of the total budget.Likewise, the capital expenditure has been estimated to be Rs352 billion, which is 18.94 percent of the budget, and the expenditure for financial management has been estimated at Rs367 billion, 19.74 percent of the budget.According to Pun, the source of financing will be Rs1.26 trillion from revenue, Rs330 billion from internal loans, Rs217 billion from external loans, and Rs52.3 billion from foreign grants. \nDeveloping infrastructure in remote parts of Nepal has historically been a neglected issue. Things were expected to improve after the introduction of the federal system. The new system came into full-fledged implementation after the first elections of federal, provincial and local units in 2017. One of the major objectives for adopting the federal system was to devolve powers to sub-national governments and strengthen them in terms of easing people’s daily lives, cutting red tape and taking state facilities closer to their doorsteps. After seven years of execution of the three-tier federal system, the sub-national authorities, however, couldn’t bring about expected improvement—bar some exceptions.Even now people in far-flung villages across the country are compelled to struggle for basic facilities. A recent report from our local correspondent in Panchthar narrates the plight of Hilihang villagers’s struggles for drinking water due to acute water shortage. People there have to make an hour-long journey to fetch water. On Monday, a report from Achham offered a glimpse of people’s struggle even to draw their social security allowances: the government provides certain amounts to single women, elderly and disabled on a monthly basis to help with their livelihoods. But folks in remote villages including those from the Turmakhand Rural Municipality have to trek for up to three days to reach the administrative centre of the rural municipality to collect their allowances. These representative cases show how people in Nepal’s villages are falling far behind in terms of enjoying even basic amenities.Nepal can’t develop without improving the status of its villages. Of the 753 local units, 460 are rural municipalities, 276 are municipalities, 11 sub-metropolitan and six are metropolitan cities. This classification shows the vast majority of our local units are still poor in infrastructure. To lift the status of people in the villages, the first need is to ensure roads, telephone and internet connectivity, which are basic needs in this day and age—besides the all-important facilities like health, education and drinking waterElderly people in Turmakhand of Achham district need to trek for days to reach the municipality’s administrative centre to get their allowances. Often, the municipalities centralise most facilities at the administrative centres. In many local units, a ward now covers an area that used to be an entire village development committee (VDC), a local body before adoption of the federal system. So, in terms of providing basic services, wards should be developed as a base station and be better equipped, resourceful and efficient to accomplish basic tasks on their own.The local units too need to explore alternatives to help people get quick and efficient services. For instance, they can mobilise mobile government teams, comprising officials from all agencies concerned, to tour villages and provide allowances and other services periodically. This in turn calls for better planning and coordination among local administrations. Moreover, provincial governments and representatives need to work harder in terms of making service delivery more efficient as well. Such initiatives have become imperative to retain people in the fast-emptying villages across the country due to the increasing trend of internal as well as external migration.  \n“Harvard, do you hear us?” Shruthi Kumar, a graduating student, raised this poignant question during her off-script speech at the Harvard University Commencement on May 23. She furiously upbraided the elite school (like many other college campuses in the US) for trying to silence pro-Palestine voices on campus. Protesting against what many consider the excesses of this government on the owner of Kantipur Media Group, Kailash Sirohiya, I want to ask: Prime Minister, do you hear us?Whack one to silence allSadly, the crackdown on the KMG publisher on May 21, 2024, resembles the action of the then autocratic King Gyanendra Shah in early June 2001. Sirohiya, Editor-in-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire and director Binod Raj Gyawali were detained for nine days and charged with sedition after Kantipur Daily published Baburam Bhattarai’s article. Bhattarai was the principal ideologue of the armed Maoist insurgency—which was then raging across the country—led by none other than the incumbent Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.If Dahal still has any sense of honesty and morality left in him, he should feel humiliated to have the same KMG owner booked, king-style, on some flimsy allegations of acquiring fake or multiple citizenships decades ago. Even the monarchist forces hadn’t quite harassed and intimidated the publishing house and its chief executive like this. Most observers, including reputed international bodies like Amnesty International and the International Federation of Journalists, smell a rat in this incident. Although Sirohiya has been arrested ostensibly for allegedly falsifying his citizenship certificate, the real purpose seems to be to silence the criticism of the government’s important ministers and curb press freedom. The government appears to think that once you whack the main guy hard, all the group members will automatically fall in line. The amount of success this endeavour will gain is for the future to tell. However, the potential repercussions may outweigh its achievements. Defence of democracyIt is widely suspected that the arrest is more of a personal vengeance, of a nasty vendetta by the irritated rulers. KMG seems to have been punished by the authorities for conducting deep research on Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in the embezzlement of large sums of funds from various cooperatives in many towns. This made KP Oli and Dahal uncomfortable as their defence for Lamichhane appeared increasingly untenable, which meant the coalition’s future became uncertain.I have nothing to do with personal tussles amongst people in power; Sirohiya, too, is not without access to power. Nevertheless, I am concerned by the latest developments because I greatly value press freedom. Independent media is a pillar of democracy. Democracy suffers damage once that independent space shrinks. It doesn’t matter whether one loves or hates KMG. I have my grievances against it and have publicly expressed some of them. I want it to be more inclusive and accommodating of diverse voices. It should do more to support the cause of lower classes, castes and neglected regions and religions. However, this is not the time, as some people are doing, to vilify and pour anger at KMG and discuss its weaknesses and limitations. This would only serve the purpose of the parties and leaders in power who are intent on sapping the freedom of expression for their own vested interests. I warn people against the coalition leadership’s potentially dangerous road towards greater intolerance and authoritarianism. I think the opposition’s—Nepali Congress party—assertion along this line is timely and appropriate. We need to be vigilant about the communists and the populists colluding to shrink the democratic space. Responsible citizens should always put their finger in the dyke. Demoralising businesses The rulers’ ultimate gain from this undue punishment of Nepal’s top media entrepreneur is unknown, but they have already alarmed the business community. This is particularly not good in a persistently failing economy. Lowering businesspeople’s morale is the last thing we need right now when small and medium businesses are rapidly shutting down and thousands of citizens are flying abroad to work in the sweatshops of Malaysia and the Gulf states every day to keep their families alive. Does this latest action encourage people to invest or divest from the country? Doesn’t the scandalous affair of harassing a long-established and esteemed businessman based on his citizenship potentially repel possible investors from non-resident Nepali (NRN) communities? Is the government aware of this potential fallout now and in the future? Offensive to Madheshis The government has not only arrested Kailash Sirohiya but also made a deliberate attempt to create a narrative that somehow he’s a potential foreigner illegally running media companies in Nepal. This has sent a wrong signal to the public and deeply offended the Madheshi community. Nepal is highly casteist and racist. People of the southern plains bear the brunt of hill racism. They are often seen as outsiders. This stems from a longstanding policy of the ruling elites over a long period. Hundreds of thousands of Madhesis, many of them Dalits, are not only landless but also stateless. They’ve been denied citizenship even after living in the country for many generations. Frustratingly, even those Madheshis who have lived here for long and significantly contributed to society, find their belonging to the land constantly questioned. If someone like Sirohiya, who owns the largest media house in the country, and has worked to restore democracy and human rights for decades, finds himself suspected as an illegal alien, can anyone imagine the plight of ordinary Madheshis? Isn’t this shameless behaviour of the Nepali state? Has the hill racism become worse in the republican era? Concerned leaders and their blind supporters may pretend not to know anything, but people are keenly watching. Such a racist attitude of the state expressed overtly or covertly, does not bode well for our peaceful and prosperous future. Today, social media is abuzz with highly critical and racist comments against Sirohiya. The smear campaign against him has peaked. Even some Dalits have criticised me for supporting whom they say is a member of the “media mafia”, of an “Indian agent”. This is deeply disturbing. To conclude, I don’t know Kailash Sirohiya personally, but I don’t need to know him. Nor do I declare him guilty or innocent of the charges; that’s for the judges to decide. In any case, my observations don’t change as my worry is only about the attack on press freedom for narrow political interests and the implicit racist attitude of the ruling elites. I’d be equally outraged if an owner, editor, or journalist of any other media corporation were similarly targeted. Sirohiya, mentioned in this article, is the publisher of the Post. The views expressed are the author’s own. \nDisaster risk refers to exposure to hazards and vulnerability to exposed elements. The same event can impact people differently due to their pre-existing conditions, including economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age, disability, and gender. Marginalised and minority groups are generally more vulnerable and are disproportionately affected by disasters. A 2007 study, “The Gendered Nature of Natural Disasters: The Impact of Catastrophic Events on the Gender Gap in Life Expectancy, 1981–2002”, shows that the mortality rates of women during a disaster are several times higher than that of men. Moreover, even though the life expectancy of women is higher than that of men, natural disasters lower the life expectancy of women. This suggests that women are more vulnerable than men. Such vulnerability is not based on biological or physiological differences but rather due to the socially constructed unequal gender norms that govern what roles women and men should play and how they should behave.More often than not, women are caregivers of the household. They are responsible for domestic tasks, child-bearing/rearing and caring for the elderly, sick or dependent family members. In addition, they may also be balancing work and community management roles. These roles receive little value as they do not generate income and leave women little time for income-generating activities. Consequently, women may have limited access and control over resources, undermining their decision-making power. Furthermore, social roles dictate social behaviour, such as not being able to leave home without the permission of a male family member and failing to learn or perform so-called masculine skills such as swimming or climbing trees. Due to these socially constructed constraints, women are inept and less willing to save themselves.Nepal's disaster risk reduction (DRR) and management systems have come a long way from the early reactive response-centric approaches to the current proactive approach, emphasising prevention and preparedness and increasing attention to gender-specific needs in the disaster context. Yet, they fall short of addressing vulnerabilities arising from pre-existing gendered social structures and unequal power relations, which affect people’s ability to respond to disaster and their lives in post-disaster contexts.Post-disaster, most of the relief and assistance provided to women is concerned with addressing the needs of pregnant and lactating women, distributing menstruation hygiene kits and establishing safe spaces. While these forms of relief are necessary and even life-saving, they reduce the needs of women to simply the needs associated with their reproductive and caregiving role and do not address the needs of women who do not fall under the category of being either pregnant, lactating, or menstruating.A study analysing the gendered impact of the 2015 Gorkha earthquake found that many women could not access relief or reconstruction aid because they were unable to provide the documentation (proof of citizenship, title to house/land). Similarly, many women, having been displaced by the earthquake and without any support to re-establish their livelihood, entered the entertainment sector, resorting to work in cabin restaurants and dance bars where they may be subject to sexual abuse. This notable rise in women seeking work in this sector results from conditions after the earthquake, but planners and policymakers do not generally consider it. As most support provided post-disaster is response-oriented and relief-focused and envisioned to achieve only short-term goals, this leaves out many other issues, such as access to general health care, food, shelter, livelihood opportunities and citizenships.Gender issues are considered an afterthought to the current DRR policies and practices. These policies add to the prevailing unequal institutional structure and do not challenge unequal gender relations and power structures, which is the root cause of the issue. Furthermore, DRR policies and practices are still imagined within traditionally defined gender roles, which promote and reinforce gender stereotypes.DRR policies and frameworks primarily view women as a monolithic identity, and the intersectionality within gendered experiences is largely ignored. Vulnerability is affected by many other factors, such as economic status, occupation, literacy, ethnicity, caste, age and disability. Analysing vulnerability by considering these multiple factors and how they inter-relate reveals that not all women are equally vulnerable and that some are multiple burdened.Furthermore, DRR strategies proposed to reduce disaster risk may serve to subject women and girls to increased hardships, harassment and exploitation. A study on the impact of Covid-19 on Nepali Women reports that due to women’s role as caregivers and their overrepresentation in service and care-oriented fields, they were more vulnerable to infection. Women were also at higher risk of falling into extreme poverty during the pandemic as they were more likely than men to be working informally. Furthermore, the lockdowns added extra childcare and domestic workload, which women mostly took up. This forced women to either quit their jobs or permanently drop out of the labour force, and it most likely decreased the participation of girls in online classes and increased the rate at which girls drop out in rural areas. The lockdowns also brought about a surge in gender-based violence cases. However, due to increased attention to the pandemic, many who sought to report incidents of abuse or seek support could not access those services promptly.Similarly, a survey by WOREC found that during the pandemic, returning migrant workers were seen as transmitters of disease and faced exclusion. Moreover, women migrant workers were negatively portrayed in social media and online news portals as promiscuous, due to which they were subject to further psychological and physical harassment from their families. Even within detention centres where returning migrants were to quarantine, women were not safe from sexual assault.Even when DRR programmes in good faith recognise women’s potential to respond to disasters, this adds more responsibility to women who now, in addition to fulfilling their caregiver, reproductive and productive roles, must also act as responders to disasters or as participants in processes of reconstruction, spending time rebuilding homes, livelihoods, and communities. This additional responsibility can negatively impact their health and well-being and create a knock-on effect on their daughters’ well-being if they have to step in to help their mothers.In the article, “Sex disaggregation alone will not energize equality”, Sarah Bradshaw argues that instead of policies serving women, women now serve policy agendas where the feminisation of responsibility is a tactic to achieve multiple goals with a single project. “The ‘solution’ involves women, but it is not about women or improving women’s welfare”. Such superficial inclusion of women may improve disaster response and reduce disaster risk. However, they will not change women’s risk of disaster. Therefore, to reduce disaster risk for women, we must focus on reducing gender inequalities. \nIf you don’t have children, you are not necessarily infertile. Perhaps you don’t want one, for whatever reason. Yet the Nepali society continues to treat couples without children as odd, and somehow medically defective. And in a still highly patriarchal setup like Nepal’s, the blame for childlessness invariably falls on women. They get asked intrusive questions about their reproductive health. Often, men in such childless unions are asked to remarry so that they can have babies and take the family lineage forward. According to a 2020 study, Nepali couples are often put under pressure into having a child in the first year of their marriage, even when both husband and wife don’t want a baby. Even if one or the other member of a couple is infertile, another research in West Africa suggests, infertility in itself is not a cause for women’s anguish, it's also what is known as the Social Pressure for Pregnancy (SSP). Most women who failed to conceive cited external pressure from families and society as the main cause of their distress.As is the case in much of the world, the fertility rate in Nepal has been on a steady decline. For instance, in the two decades since 2002, there was a 50 percent dip in the country’s fertility rate. Greater awareness on family planning, increasing literacy and the rise in the number of families where both partners earn are responsible for this decline. So, again, many couples are not having children mostly out of choice. Yet women in particular continue to be under incredible social pressure to have babies, with women’s agency over their own bodies constantly undermined by their larger family and friend circles. Let’s face it, Nepal is still a men’s country where women and girls are routinely abused, verbally if not physically. When they face sexual assault, it becomes the women’s responsibility to establish guilt, even as the idea of consent is broadly defined in favour of the male perpetrator. There are far fewer women in decision-making roles, both in public and private sectors, again because of entrenched bias against women’s leadership qualities. It is hardly a surprise that whenever the chhaupadi huts are brought down in western Nepal, they come right back up. There could be no better example of society's attempt to control women, including their sexual and reproductive lives. Things are not so bad for women in urban parts of Nepal, but it is far from satisfactory. Women are expected to have more children, yet most organisations offer little in terms of maternity leave. It is good that the government is preparing to extend maternity leave to six months from the current provision of 14 weeks. Such progressive policies will help women better juggle work and family. They should also help Nepal avert the kind of sharp decline in population fast-ageing countries like Japan and China are now witnessing. But, at the end of the day, it is the women who should decide whether or not they want to have babies and how many. In a progressive society, they should get the environment to do so.   \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nIsraeli tanks advanced to the centre of Rafah for the first time on Tuesday, witnesses said, three weeks into a ground offensive in the southern Gaza city that has stirred global condemnation for its continued civilian toll.Tanks and armoured vehicles mounted with machineguns were spotted near Al-Awda mosque, a central Rafah landmark, the witnesses told Reuters. The Israeli military said its forces continued to operate in the Rafah area, without commenting on reported advances into the city centre.Overnight, its forces battered the city with airstrikes and tank fire, residents said, pressing the offensive despite an international outcry over an attack on Sunday that sparked a massive blaze in a tent camp, killing at least 45 Palestinians, more than half of them children, women and the elderly.Global leaders voiced horror at the fire in a designated “humanitarian zone” where families uprooted by fighting elsewhere in Gaza had sought shelter, and urged the implementation of a World Court order for a halt to Israel’s assault.In another move purportedly aimed at reining in the violence, Spain, Ireland and Norway were to officially recognise a Palestinian state on Tuesday.The three countries have said they hope their decision will accelerate efforts towards securing a ceasefire in Israel’s war against Hamas militants, now in its eighth month, that has reduced much of the densely populated territory to rubble.Residents said Rafah’s Tel Al-Sultan neighbourhood, the scene of Sunday’s night-time strike in which tents and shelters were set ablaze as families settled down to sleep, was still being bombarded.“Tank shells are falling everywhere in Tel Al-Sultan. Many families have fled their houses in western Rafah under fire throughout the night,” one resident told Reuters via a chat app.Around one million people - many repeatedly displaced by shifting waves of the war - have fled the Israeli offensive in Rafah since early May, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA) reported on Tuesday.A video obtained by Reuters showed families on the move again, carrying their belongings through Rafah’s shattered streets, their weary children trailing behind them.“There are a lot of attacks, smoke and dust. It is death from God...The (Israelis) are hitting everywhere. We’re tired,” said Moayad Fusaifas, pushing along belongings on two bicycles.ISRAEL SAYS IT’S IN COMBAT NEAR EGYPT BORDERSince Israel launched its incursion by taking control of the Rafah border crossing with Egypt three weeks ago, tanks had probed around the outskirts and entered some eastern districts but had not yet moved into the city in full force.In recent days, Israeli tanks have thrust towards western neighbourhoods and taken up positions on the Zurub hilltop in western Rafah. On Tuesday, witnesses reported gunbattles between Israeli troops and Hamas-led fighters in the Zurub area.Witnesses in central Rafah said the Israeli military appeared to have brought in remote-operated armoured vehicles and there was no immediate sign of personnel in or around them. An Israeli military spokesperson had no immediate comment.The Israeli military said it operated overnight along the Philadelphi Corridor that separates Gaza from Egypt “based on intelligence indicating the presence of terror targets”.Israeli troops were engaged in close-quarter combat and were locating tunnel shafts, weapons and militant infrastructure, it said in a statement.Israel has kept up attacks despite the ruling by the International Court of Justice on Friday ordering it to stop, arguing that the top UN court’s ruling grants it some scope for military action there.More than 36,000 Palestinians have been killed in Israel’s offensive, Gaza’s health ministry says. Israel launched its air and ground war after Hamas-led militants attacked southern Israeli communities on Oct. 7, killing around 1,200 people and seizing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies.Israel says it wants to root out Hamas fighters holed up in Rafah and rescue hostages it says are being held in the area.Since Sunday’s strike on the tent camp, at least 26 more people have been killed by Israeli fire in Rafah, health officials in the Hamas-run enclave said.In Jabalia in the northern Gaza Strip, one of the largest of the enclave’s eight historic refugee camps, Israeli forces have been engaged in fierce fighting with Hamas and Islamic Jihad fighters, residents said.In some residential districts from which Israeli forces have retreated, civil emergency teams said they were recovering bodies from the ruins. \nThe government has outlined five key strategies and priorities for the upcoming fiscal year's budget, alongside five strategies for economic reforms.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said increasing production, productivity, and employment; increasing investment and growth and accelerating economic activities by boosting the morale of the private sector; human resource development; alleviating economic disparities and poverty through the balanced and just mobilisation of resources; and increasing the effectiveness of the public service delivery have been presented as the five objectives of the budget for the new fiscal year. Similarly, economic reforms and promotion of the private sector; building industrial infrastructure in agriculture, energy information technology sectors; promotion of social sectors such as education and health; promotion of inclusion and social security; and improvement in good governance and service delivery are declared as the five priorities of the government for the upcoming fiscal year.The five strategies for economic reforms are structural reforms; improvement in the business environment; reforms in the public finance system; financial sector reforms; and reforms in public administration. \nThe federal government is to allocate Rs567 billion to the provincial and local governments in the coming financial year 2024-25. This will be made through fiscal transfer and revenue sharing from the federal budget.According to the budget statement read out by Finance Minister Barsh Man Pun in the Parliament today, on the recommendation of the National Natural Resources and Fiscal Commission, the federal government has allocated Rs60 billion for the provinces and Rs88 billion for the local level towards the fiscal equalization grants.Likewise, a conditional grant worth Rs25.84 billion has been earmarked for the provinces and Rs28.88 billion for the local level.Another Rs6.2 billion has been allocated to the province and Rs7 billion rupees to the local level towards supplementary grants. In addition, Rs4.4 billion has been allocated for the province and Rs8.5 billion for the local level as a special grant.Finance Minister Pun said that arrangements will be made to transfer conditional, supplementary and special grants based on performance. The government estimates that 159 billion rupees will be transferred to the provincial and local levels as part of revenue sharing. \nTorrential rains brought by cyclone Remal caused a collapse in a stone quarry in India's state of Mizoram, killing 15 people and trapping seven, while eight more died in landslides and other accidents elsewhere in the remote region, officials said.Weather authorities said the powerful cyclone had weakened into a depression after devastating regional coastlines the previous day, when it killed at least 16 and cut power to millions in parts of eastern India and neighbouring Bangladesh.But harsh weather was hampering efforts on Tuesday to rescue at least seven people trapped in the quarry on the outskirts of Aizawl, the capital of northeastern Mizoram, disaster management officials said.“There have been incessant rains in the wake of cyclone Remal, which led to the quarry collapse,” one of them told Reuters, speaking on condition of anonymity.Seven more people were killed in landslides in Mizoram, which shares a border with Bangladesh, while a falling tree killed one person in nearby Assam, officials said, as schools and colleges shut.Authorities in India's eastern state of West Bengal were working to restore electricity in the worst-affected areas, after Remal stripped power lines and uprooted trees.Remal is the first of the frequent storms expected to pound the low-lying coasts of the South Asian neighbours this year as climate change drives up sea surface temperatures.Many parts of coastal Bangladesh have no electricity and telecoms links, officials said, but crews were working to restore power as soon as possible.“Mass evacuations significantly reduced potential casualties, but the storm left a trail of destruction,” said disaster management chief Mijanur Rahman, adding that damages cannot be fully estimated unless communications are restored. \nThe government has allocated a Rs9.28 billion budget for the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies.Presenting the budget for the fiscal year 2024/25 in the joint meeting of the federal parliament on Tuesday, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said the budget to the ministry has been reduced by Rs180 million.The government allocated Rs9.46 billion to the ministry's budget for the current fiscal year, and Rs10.48 billion was allocated in the earlier fiscal year.  \nThe government has announced establishing a consumer court.Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun made the announcement on Tuesday while unveiling the budget for the fiscal year 2024-25. He said the necessary budget has been allocated to establish the court.“Activities like black-marketing and syndicate in the market will be controlled,” Pun said while presenting the budget, “Consumer court will also be formed. I have allocated a budget for the purpose.” \nThe Speaker of the House of Representatives is expected to run parliamentary proceedings impartially following democratic norms. In parliamentary tradition, after being elected, the Speaker dissociates himself or herself from the party that gave the election ticket to maintain neutrality.Speakers in Nepal, however, have often run into controversies. They have also been accused of failing to maintain neutrality while conducting parliamentary business. At times, they are accused of working at the behest of the mother party.The Speaker’s role becomes crucial in minimising inter-party rivalry that often leads to a political deadlock. Some Speakers such as Daman Nath Dhungana and Subas Nembang have successfully played that role as well.The incumbent Speaker Devraj Ghimire also faces the charge of failing to demonstrate an impartial role.On Saturday, Ghimire addressed a gathering organised by a provincial chapter of the Federation of Nepali Journalists where he said since Parliament had been held hostage, “some measures may need to be taken”. He went on to say that the government may be forced to introduce the fiscal budget through an ordinance should the House deadlock prolong.His controversial statement came ahead of political leaders’ consultations on the day as they tried to find a way out of the impasse. Soon afterwards, Ghimire attended a meeting convened by Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal with CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, and Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the Rastriya Swatantra Party chief.The opposition leaders have fiercely criticised the Speaker mainly after the May 16 incident when the Congress and the UML lawmakers had a scuffle during the House meeting. A UML lawmaker, Ghimire formally disassociated himself from the party after being elected the Speaker in early 2023.Experts on parliamentary affairs say Speaker candidates must be picked carefully, analysing if they can do justice to the top position of the legislature. When the Speakers are selected on the basis of their relations with party leaders, they often take decisions to suit the leaders they are grateful to.Speaker is a crucial constitutional position, former Speaker Daman Nath Dhungana told the Post. But political parties often give the post to someone from the party so as to satisfy their aspirations.On May 15, UML chair Oli hinted that as Congress lawmakers had continuously been barring Home Minister Lamichhane from speaking in the House, the situation would be changed. Congress, the main opposition party, has been disrupting the House proceedings, demanding a parliamentary inquiry against Lamichhane in his alleged connections with cooperative funds embezzlement. \"It is unacceptable to us that only the Congress speaks in the meeting. Congress is not the only party in Parliament,” Oli said at the UML parliamentary party meeting on May 15. “Home Minister Lamichhane will speak at the parliament meeting tomorrow; if not, our party will speak.”The next day, Speaker Ghimire allowed Home Minister Lamichhane to go to the rostrum and make his statement while Congress lawmakers were already chanting slogans. Then the situation turned tense and resulted in a scuffle.Though Congress allowed President Ramchandra Paudel to present the government’s policies and programmes on May 14, it obstructed the motion to thank the head of state for the task, as per the parliamentary tradition.After the May 16 incident, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa criticised Speaker Ghimire for his role in Parliament. “Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened in the House is unfortunate, and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.” However, former Speaker Taranath Ranabhat, also a former general secretary of the Congress, does not agree with Thapa. Speakers should not be held squarely responsible for their role in Parliament, said Ranabhat.“Parliamentarians represent their parties, but the Speaker's role is like a referee,” Ranabhat told the Post. “When trying to bring everyone together, sometimes the Speaker might try to favour some parties to win their confidence which might be uncomfortable for others. However, the Speaker's role should not be questioned on that basis alone.”Earlier, the roles played by former Speakers Agni Prasad Sapkota and Krishna Bahadur Mahara—both from the Maoist Centre—became controversial too. Then-finance minister Janardan Sharma, a Maoist Centre leader, tabled the substitution bill related to budget ordinances in Parliament in September 2021, amid protests of the main opposition UML. Speaker Sapkota had allowed Sharma to table the bill amid obstruction from the UML.The UML also accused Speaker Sapkota of aiding the party’s split. The UML at the time had urged the Speaker to sack 14 UML lawmakers, who defected to form the CPN (Unified Socialist) under Madhav Kumar Nepal. However, the Speaker refused to formalise the UML’s decision. The UML persistently protested in Parliament demanding Sapkota’s resignation as Speaker.In January 2019, Speaker Mahara was accused of siding with the ruling party during the passage of the National Medical Education Bill, even though the Congress had contested some of the bill's clauses. Additionally, he came under fire for not allowing Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba to voice his opinion in the House before inviting then-prime minister Oli to speak on the contentious Guthi Bill. Ramchandra Paudel, a former Congress leader who became the Speaker after the 1996 midterm election, even faced impeachment for his role in Parliament. An impeachment motion was registered against him on September 23, 1998, for aiding the passage of a bill amid obstructions from the main opposition UML.In principle, the Speaker shouldn’t carry forward the House business even if a single parliamentarian raises his hand, says Hari Bahadur Thapa, a senior journalist who has followed Parliament for more than two decades.The Speaker has the right to marshal security personnel against a parliamentarian if they disrupt the House proceedings, but s/he cannot carry forward the House business when there is an obstruction, Thapa told the Post. \nThe current key financial indicators in Nepal are highly paradoxical and worrisome. According to the latest data released by the Nepal Rastra Bank, the central bank of Nepal, deposits in banks and financial institutions (BFIs) have crossed the Rs6.16 trillion mark, while credit disbursement is Rs5.12 trillion. These two figures are 108 and 92 percent of Nepal's estimated Rs5.7 trillion gross domestic product (GDP), respectively. This means that even after maintaining mandatory cash ratios with the central bank—which amounts to around Rs3.6 trillion in aggregate—about Rs6.5 trillion is available as loanable liquidity in the banking system. This, indeed, should have been a god-sent historical opportunity to catapult Nepal to the next level of economic activities and growth. Sadly, that does not seem to be on the anvil.Now, the loan uptake by the entrepreneurs and investors is very slow. The credit growth is 2 percent slower than the deposit growth. The effective interest rate is still in double digits, hovering between 10 to 12 percent. For small borrowers who generally rely on microfinance institutions and credit cooperatives, the cost of funds is at least 20 percent. High interest rate is apparently one of the key deterrents to potential borrowers. Also, a higher amount of deposit collection compared to loan disbursement is taking a toll on the profitability of the BFIs.On one hand, despite most BFIs’ favourable loanable liquidity position, they are unwilling to cut the interest rate for fear of a further decline in profitability. Such practices blatantly compromise the principle of price determination in a free and complete market based on the quantity of funds demanded and supplied. On the other hand, non-performing loans (NPL) of the BFIs are rapidly growing. The total NPL was 3.6 percent of the total loan disbursement last January, which has now risen to 4.8 percent. In nominal terms, approximately Rs250 billion worth of loans is slipping into the risky zone. As its obvious aftermath, the number of borrowers blacklisted for their default on timely repayment is reported to be about 200 per day. This inescapable trap to businesses is created due to the growing number of business closures and increasing financial losses in those businesses struggling to survive. Economy in recessionTechnically, a recession is defined as a decline in GDP growth for two consecutive quarters. However, to the great relief of the ruling political leaders and bureaucracy, Nepal does not produce quarterly GDP growth data. If the annual growth forecasts like the recent ones from the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank, which predicted Nepal's growth rate to be no more than 4 percent in 2024, are to be trusted, Nepal is clearly in a recessionary trajectory. Other disappointing trends in real income, industrial output, employment rate, wholesale and retail sales and overall service sector performance confirm that the economy went downhill in several successive quarters to arrive at this stage.Other rather subjective but evident recession traits are manifested in the form of pervasive plummeting of the consumers' confidence, investors' confidence, overall market confidence, and trust deficit on the incumbent government's sincerity as the principal agent supposed to work for the economic betterment of the country.The gapsThe economic revival looks challenging even in several years if the government fails to take bold countercyclical measures, mainly in revenue collection, capital expenditure and implementing fiscal federalism. And the monetary policy must improve corporate governance in the banking sector, which private sector players dominate by more than 90 percent. This is exactly where effective coordination between fiscal and monetary policies is indispensable.On the fiscal policy side, if the tax policy to find new revenue sources is not comprehensively recalibrated, the collected revenue, like in recent years, will continue to fall short of even meeting the current expenditures, let alone augmenting the capital expenditure and saving the country from default on sovereign debt servicing. The capital allocation in the federal budget is pathetic, persistently at less than 20 percent of total earmarks. Worse, the spending capacity has effectively come down to about 40 percent of even such a low allocation.Despite federalism devolving the constitutional authority to sub-national levels to devise 'their own' public procurement laws, timely completion of contractual procedures of the projects has been extremely tardy. The complications are added by the vested interests of the people in executive power in awarding contracts with apparent conflict of interest. When the government, as the single largest procurer, fails to spend its capital budget transparently, the cash flow in the financial market is bound to shrink. This has direct ramifications on the liquidity positions of the BFIs. The persistent failure of the governments at all three tiers to carry out the capital expenditure as outlined has a cumulative adverse impact.Trust the systemA sincere effort to put fiscal federalism into practice in the true spirit of the federal polity and state architecture will certainly solve several critical issues related to fiscal resource management at the provincial or municipal levels. For instance, reasonably effective management of the bond market at the centre helps generate resources for development expenditure. In allocation, the disbursement may be proportionate to the absorption capacity of an individual administrative unit like a ministry or a federal unit like a municipality. This would ameliorate a number of pending constraints faced by the entire financial system of the country. It is already too late to consider the legislation to empower competent municipalities to issue their own development bonds so as to enhance the fiscal policy independence of the local governments and increase the stakeholder ownership of the executed projects.To conclude, two critical steps are inevitable to rescue the economy from the brink of a deeper recession. One, a stimulus package with an amalgam of fiscal and monetary incentives is necessary. The business-as-usual budget will not solve new challenges to the economy, like the rapidly depleting base of state income. Two, the impending credit risk in BFIs will be far larger if the businesses are not put back on track by enabling them to unlock their full potential, now an existential threat due to the engulfing recession. \nSunday marked the seventh year of the signing of the Belt and Road Initiative between Nepal and China yet the two sides are still struggling to finalise the implementation plan of the BRI that China proposed in early 2020.Nepal and China signed a memorandum of understanding on the One Belt One Road, later known as BRI, a flagship initiative of Chinese President Xi Jinping, on May 12, 2017, subject to renewal every three years.Still, there is a divergence of views on whether Nepal needs a dedicated BRI implementation plan to execute the projects under the Chinese initiative, senior government leaders and officials told the Post. Hence there is no clarity over when and how the implementation plan will be signed.The draft titled “Implementation Plan on Jointly Building the Belt and Road Initiative between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Nepal” is currently under the purview of the National Planning Commission for its redrafting/processing.There was a general understanding between Nepal and China to sign the BRI implementation plan during the China visit of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal in September last year as well as during the visit of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, in March this year. But there was little progress on both the visits and the signing was indefinitely postponed.The draft of the BRI implementation plan is not ready yet, DPM Shrestha said. It is said to be in the final stage of completion. Shrestha says he tried to push the plan in his interactions with the Chinese side but there has been no progress.One senior government official told the Post that the elections in India are the primary reason the plan has not made headway in China.No sensitive decision that may hurt relations with India and China will be taken around election time, said an official at the prime minister’s office who is privy to the issue.Shrestha said that projects under the BRI will be selected only after the plan’s signing.“It is our position that we will select a new set of projects only after signing the BRI implementation plan,” Shrestha told the Post.Asked about the nine projects selected during the tenure of KP Sharma Oli as the prime minister in 2019-20, Shrestha said they now have only referential value.The text of the BRI implementation plan, which Nepal first received in early 2020 after Chinese President Xi Jinping’s Nepal visit, is a comprehensive document that outlines nine clusters: economic cooperation, agriculture, education, connectivity, trade, investment, tourism, culture, and people-to-people cooperation.It said that the two sides would identify projects, discuss the investment modality and the way to execute it. After several rounds of exchanging text and comments, the Chinese side in October 2021 sent their draft to the Sher Bahadur Deuba government.After Deuba became the prime minister, China’s State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi came to Nepal on an official visit. He then shared that Beijing has reservations over the financing modality of the projects to be undertaken under the BRI; Nepal had made it clear that it cannot afford loans with over 1 percent interest to implement the projects, and the country prioritised grants and concessional loans.“The country’s economic situation has not improved. We are not in a position to take loans from anywhere including China as they would increase pressure on the weak Nepali economy,” said an official at the Prime Minister’s Office.Amid the delays, China last year started the “Silkroad Roadster” in Nepal, focusing on some small-scale projects.Nepal gave continuity to its old position when Prime Minister Dahal visited China in September-October last year.“When the issue of BRI was discussed in Beijing during the prime minister’s trip, we told the Chinese authorities that we will sign the implementation plan at an ‘appropriate’ time,” former foreign minister NP Saud, a Nepali Congress leader, said. “We also conveyed to the Chinese officials and leaders that our preference is grant, not loan.”The Congress and other political parties have called for a national consensus on vital issues like the BRI or any other development or economic vehicle with far-reaching consequences for the country. Apart from the investment modality, Nepal also has reservations over a clause of the BRI implementation plan dealing with security concerns.A former minister familiar with the plan expresses reservations over the text handed over by the Chinese, which Nepal wants to amend before signing or avoid. The document’s sub-section 12 titled ‘Other Areas’ under section 3 named ‘Cooperation Priorities’ mentions that “the two sides will strengthen legal cooperation and actively carry out diverse legal exchanges and capacity building in order to facilitate B&R [belt and road] cooperation”.It also says “the two sides will implement relevant agreements on law enforcement cooperation and strengthen security cooperation through joint training, information exchange, and capacity building, including for disaster management”.Beijing accords the BRI top foreign policy priority. In every high-level visit and meeting between Nepal and China, the initiative gets traction.Although there is no clear provision on whether the two sides should renew the agreement by exchanging correspondence, officials at the finance ministry said that would be the diplomatically correct way to go about it.There are concerns over the BRI’s stalled momentum in Nepal. The initiative’s stated focus is connectivity, trade, development strategies, and policy dialogues for cooperation in the fields of economy, environment, technology and culture.The agreement also aims to facilitate transit transport, logistics, transport network security and related infrastructure development through joint study and promote cross-border projects including railway, road, civil aviation, power grid, information and communication. The MoU also states that the two sides would conclude the joint feasibility study of China-Nepal Free Trade Agreement shortly and, if viable, start negotiations on a Free Trade Agreement to open up more markets and expand bilateral trade.Other stated areas of agreed cooperation are establishing cross-border economic cooperation zones at the existing ports, and improving the investment landscape with a view to developing mega projects in the areas of power generation, water conservation, road, railway line, cross-border transmission line, information and communication technology and infrastructure, besides customs and quarantine.Nepal also had a shaky position on the BRI in the past. After signing the deal in 2017, the government formed two committees headed by the foreign and finance secretaries to negotiate with China on the projects selected under the initiative. The finance secretary was tasked with project selection.As per the Cabinet’s mandate, the finance secretary-led committee picked 35 projects to be funded under the BRI. Then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli read out this list during his meeting with Chinese counterpart Li Keqiang. Later, the Chinese side urged Kathmandu to cut the number of projects to a single digit, whereupon the list was pared down to nine projects.A former finance ministry official who was involved in several negotiations with the Chinese side said most of the nine projects were related to connectivity and infrastructure. In 2019, during the second BRI Conference in China, its outcome document listed Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network under the BRI. (Former President Bidya Devi Bhandari had attended the conference.) Then, when Chinese President Xi visited Kathmandu in October 2019, the two sides agreed to enhance cooperation under the BRI.They agreed “to intensify implementation of the Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation under the Belt and Road Initiative to enhance connectivity, encompassing such vital components as ports, roads, railways, aviation and communications within the overarching framework of the Trans-Himalayan Multi-Dimensional Connectivity Network with a view to significantly contributing to Nepal’s development agenda of graduating from a Least Developed Country,” according to a joint statement issued after Xi’s visit to Kathmandu.The Chinese side was keen to carry out the feasibility study of Kerung-Kathmandu railway under the BRI, the former finance ministry official said. “But we have shifting priorities on selecting and negotiating other projects.”The feasibility study of the Kerung-Kathmandu railway has already begun with a Chinese grant and it is expected to conclude by 2026 June, said Rohit Kumar Bisural, director general at Department of Railways.“As per our agreement, the feasibility study of the cross border railway should be completed by 2026 June. There are various studies on the ground. Nepali engineers and technical staff are not directly involved but they are supporting the Chinese technicians as required. There are no glitches. Once the study is complete, we will jointly write a report,” said Bisural.A joint secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs told the Post that no tangible progress has been made in the past seven years in implementing the BRI plan and no agreement is likely anytime soon either.“This calls for consensus among the political parties as it is not just a matter of the government or one party,” said the joint-secretary. “The BRI is unlikely to move forward in Nepal anytime soon because there is no discussion, consultation and consensus among the major parties.”Mahendra Bahadur Pandey, former foreign minister and Nepal’s ex-ambassador to China, said many leaders and officials have blamed high-interest loans for not taking the BRI forward but that is not the reason.“We do not complete projects on time. If we did, we could easily pay back the loan and interest to China and other lending countries. Our leaders also fear the reaction of other countries [to accepting any kind of Chinese help],” said Pandey.“We have ‘fear psychosis’ while taking economic support,” he said. “Nepalis are scared that India, China or the United States will be angry if the country takes support from any one of them.” “We have to accept foreign support by taking neighbours and major powers into confidence,” Pandey said. \nNepal’s judiciary is often accused of engaging in judicial activism.The latest episode came on May 3. A division bench of justices Sapana Pradhan Malla and Saranga Subedi, while passing a verdict in a writ petition challenging government formation in Gandaki Province, said the Speaker should not be counted as a member of the provincial assembly in government formation.Khagaraj Adhikari of the CPN-UML became the chief minister presenting a list of 31 members, including the Speaker, in the 60-strong provincial assembly. The decision was challenged, saying it was unconstitutional. However, the court said the assembly’s strength is 59, excluding the Speaker, and 30 members make a majority. “The ruling alliance has the support of 30 provincial assembly members without counting the Speaker, which is the majority of 59,” said the ruling.Not everyone agreed. A section of constitutional experts and politicians said it was wrong to exclude the Speaker while determining the total strength of the assembly.In March 2021, passing a verdict about the Election Commission’s decision to award Nepal Communist Party (NCP) to KP Sharma Oli and Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Supreme Court reinstated CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) to their pre-merger state. The decision was widely criticised, shown as it was an example of judicial activism. The verdict went beyond what the petitioner had demanded.In a democracy, different state organs have their own jurisdictions and limits under the principle of separation of power. The different state organs have the power for checks and balances as defined by the constitution. However, when one state organ fails to perform its expected role, it gives room for another state organ to overstep its jurisdiction, observers say.They say the practice of taking every contentious political issue to the court has naturally increased the judiciary’s ambition. “We have seen judicial activism for a long time,” Vijay Kant Karna, a professor of political science at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post, blaming the political parties for it. “Setting the tenure of the Constituent Assembly was one of its extreme examples. Sadly, such incidents have become more frequent over time.”He said political leadership has the prime responsibility to strengthen democratic practice where all state mechanisms perform their defined roles.Unfortunately, the political parties and their leadership are the most “anarchist” and can play any card to remain in power, he said. Seeking the judiciary’s intervention on every contentious issue that can have political solutions is a sign of a deteriorating political culture, Karna added. “I see a gradual shift towards judicial supremacy over constitutional supremacy,” he said.Currently, the fate of three provincial governments is in the hands of the Supreme Court. The top court has directed the Gandaki government not to discharge activities with long term consequences. Similarly, writ petitions challenging the formation of the governments in Koshi and Sudurpaschim are under consideration in the apex court.Whether these governments will remain intact will depend on the court’s ruling. If there was a sound political culture among the parties, the issue of Koshi and Gandaki would have never reached the court, observers the Post talked to said.They said the judiciary must be the last resort to decide the political course, but the current practice is the other way round.The political leadership has surrendered not just inter-party feuds but also intra-party ones to the court. Petitions regarding the leadership dispute within the Nagarik Unmukti Party are sub judice in the top court. Similarly, on Monday, Upendra Yadav, the chairman of the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal, knocked the top court’s door against the Election Commission’s move to register a new party under the leadership of Ashok Rai.On May 6, the commission registered a splinter faction of Yadav's party as a new party—Janata Samajbadi Party. Yadav has termed the move unconstitutional.Observers say inter- and intra-party differences could have been sorted out through political negotiations. But several cases have landed in the court without any prior attempts to resolve them through dialogue. “In principle, the court has a role in settling cases with complex legal and constitutional questions,” Raju Prasad Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer, told the Post. “Cases of the political nature unnecessarily drag the judiciary into controversy as the defending side always criticises it.”When the Supreme Court overturned the twin decisions of then KP Sharma Oli government to dissolve the House, the CPN-UML had publicly criticised the decision. Similarly, the court’s order to dissolve the Nepal Communist Party was termed as politically motivated and intended to favour Oli.In the views of the experts, such political cases are also wasting crucial time of the court. As such cases are given priority, decisions on other cases are delayed. “It is not the judiciary that should be determining the political order. The political leadership should be doing so,” Balaram KC, a former justice, told the Post. “The court should refrain from intervening in every political development. It must demarcate its jurisdiction.”KC says using the court to determine the political order is like taking paracetamol for a chronic disease; it may lower the fever and relieve the pain, but doesn’t cure the disease. “Political problems should be resolved politically for a long-term solution,” he said.Observers say the way political parties are delegating responsibilities to the judiciary could spell disaster for democracy.“Pakistan is a good example of what happens when the court’s ambitions grow,” Karna, the political science professor, said. “Why not correct it before it is too late?”Legal experts, however, do not see any threat of judicial supremacy. “The court passes a verdict based on the law and constitution. I, therefore, don’t see threat from the judiciary,” said Chapagain, the constitutional lawyer. “However, I see a need for a decision from the Supreme Court on setting demarcations on which types of cases it should consider.”  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nThe task force, formed to draft the terms of reference (ToR) for a parliamentary probe panel on the cooperative scams, on Tuesday agreed on the jurisdiction of the panel.The four-member task force led by Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri agreed on a four-point ToR for the probe committee, which will comprise seven members and has been given a three-month tenure.As per the agreement, the probe panel will conduct a study and make recommendations on resolution of legal and institutional issues faced by cooperatives and on regulations, supervision and transparency of their financial system. Likewise, the panel will also make recommendations on safeguarding the savings of the depositors, and quick and easy refunds for the victims whose deposits have been embezzled. The panel also agreed to probe crisis-ridden cooperatives and fast-track the refund process for the depositors of the cooperatives concerned.Those cooperatives that have been linked with the funding of the now-defunct Gorkha Media Network will also be probed.The fourth point of the agreement reads, “study on the status of the funds transferred to various organisations, including Gorkha Media Network Pvt Ltd, whether the funds were obtained legally or illegally, and how the funds were put to use will be conducted.”The panel will also make recommendations for appropriate disciplinary actions against all those found guilty of the crime and for the recovery of the misused deposits.According to a member of the task force, the parliamentary committee will be announced in a meeting of the House of Representatives. \nLast week, the Agriculture and Livestock Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City advised the general public to make sure that their bottled and jarred water is safe to drink. The warning was issued after municipal inspectors found algae and other particles in bottled water.“Our inspectors sent back bottled water delivery vehicles to their companies after finding issues with the water, containers, and labels,” said Nurnidhi Neupane, the chief of the department. “We will also inspect water in shops in the coming days.”The city office has no immediate plans to test the quality of water supplied to households by the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited, as the metropolis itself is responsible for that supply. Neupane said that his office will prioritise monitoring bottled and jar water first.Bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe. However, tests show the presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors say it is not the first time that the water used by people in the Valley was found contaminated with potentially deadly microbes. What concerns them more is that water quality has not improved much.Other local units in the Valley said that they do not have the budget to regularly test the quality of water being supplied to households in their jurisdictions.“We had tested samples of drinking water collected from various sources in the past and found some problems,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Health Office Lalitpur. “But all the budget allocated for water testing has already been used up. We can resume testing drinking water quality only after a new budget is allocated.”The Health Office Lalitpur tested the drinking water samples collected from ward 6 of Godawari Municipality in March and found them contaminated with faecal coliform.Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or their faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform means that the drinking water used by locals of the Godawari ward is contaminated with sewage.The Lalitpur district includes the rural municipalities of Mahalaxmi, Godawari, Konjyoson, Bagmati, and Mahankal, along with Lalitpur Metropolitan City.The Nagarjun Municipality in Kathmandu also said that it does not have the budget to carry out quality testing of drinking water in the current fiscal year.“We had done water testing in the past with help from the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited,” said Krishna Bahadur Kunwar, an information officer of the municipality. “We can resume water testing only after we receive a new budget in the next fiscal year.”Although testing the drinking water used by the public is a regular responsibility of health agencies at the local level, most such agencies are unable to conduct regular testing due to insufficient budgets.Hospitals in the Valley have reported a surge in cases of diarrhoea and food poisoning recently, and contaminated water and food have been identified as the main causes. As the pre-monsoon rainfall has started, health workers say the risk of contamination has gone up.Doctors said there are chances of outbreaks of diarrheal infections in multiple places where water from contaminated sources is being distributed.Experts advise the public to ensure their water is safe for drinking. They say consuming contaminated water not only causes diarrheal infections and deadly cholera, but also increases the chances of contracting diseases like dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.According to them, launching awareness drives and ensuring access to safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases.  \nAmid the ongoing cooperative sector crisis and political turmoil, the Nepal government presents the 2024-25 budget, addressing concerns about the sustainability of the three-pillar economic model and public dissatisfaction with government performance.\nParliamentary committee's ToR remains unresolved as ruling and opposition parties clash over investigating Deputy PM Lamichhane in cooperative scam probe.\nNepali Congress and Rastriya Prajatantra Party launch protests demanding parliamentary investigation against Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane for alleged misuse of cooperative funds and media suppression.\nTensions escalate between ruling and opposition parties over investigation into cooperatives scam, with personal accusations being made by Rastriya Swatantra Party and Nepali Congress leaders, leading to uncertainty in the vote of trust motion for Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal.\nPolitical deadlock intensifies as ruling and opposition parties clash over parliamentary probe into cooperative scam, escalating tensions over budget announcement.\nThe main opposition, Nepali Congress, has questioned the constitutional role and the impartiality of Speaker Devraj Ghimire following a scuffle between ruling and opposition lawmakers in the House of Representatives.After Thursday’s incident, relations between the ruling CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the main opposition, Nepali Congress, could get more sour.“The Speaker should take the main responsibility for today’s incident,” Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said during a news conference after the scuffle between the opposition and ruling lawmakers. “The Speaker was following a leader’s order.” Thapa hinted that the Speaker was guided by the ruling CPN-UML. Ghimire was elected to the House from Jhapa on a UML ticket. Though a lawmaker formally disassociates him/herself from the party, their independence in running the House is often questioned.“Why did the Speaker take the House proceedings ahead forcefully when the main opposition was protesting?” Thapa said. “Whatever happened today in the House is unfortunate and the Speaker should bear the responsibility.”He also hinted that UML chairman KP Sharma Oli had instigated Thursday’s tensions. While speaking at a function on Wednesday, Oli had stated that Thursday’s Parliament meeting would proceed despite obstruction by the Nepali Congress. “Today we saw that happen,” said Thapa. “This means the Speaker was taking orders from the leader [Oli].”Thapa claimed that when his party’s vice-president, Dhanraj Gurung, was chanting slogans demanding a parliamentary probe, Oli approached and provoked him. Then the scuffle ensued, said Thapa.Thapa also declared that the Congress will not sit for talks with anyone until a parliamentary committee is formed. Some Congress leaders were earlier in talks with their Rastriya Swatantra Party counterparts and had exchanged terms of reference of the proposed parliamentary committee, but there was no further development due to their differences. Leaders said that Thursday’s scuffle has added to the uncertainty of the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate the cooperatives scam and Lamichhane’s alleged involvement.“We were about to agree on the terms of reference [ToR] of the proposed parliamentary committee with the Rastriya Swatantra Party,” said a Nepali Congress office bearer. “But there was a disagreement after the RSP refused to include the home minister’s name in the draft.”The ToR proposed by the Congress explicitly called for probing the role of the home minister in the cooperatives scam. But the RSP has been insisting on a probe into the entire cooperatives sector and not Lamichhane.   \nOver 7,000 children between six and eight years of age are out of school in the Kathmandu district and could miss the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) in the ongoing immunisation drive, health authorities estimate.Officials said they only have an estimation of the number of children in that age bracket but do not know their whereabouts.“Children in the floating population, of parents working in construction sectors and factories or of those residing in slum settlements, who do not go to school, are the high-risk groups but they could be deprived of the vaccination programme,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of the Health Office, Kathmandu.“We will run a vaccination programme in health facilities on the last day of the campaign, but we are unsure if all the children missing the vaccine will get inoculated.”The Ministry of Health and Population launched a nationwide immunisation drive on Sunday, targeting over 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 who have missed the inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) due to a global shortage. Those children were administered only Type-1 and Type-3 polio oral vaccines and had missed the Type-2 polio vaccine.Officials at the Immunisation Section of the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services estimated that thousands of children throughout the country neither go to school nor participate in health care programmes.“Providing health care services, including routine vaccines, to those populations is the most challenging task,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, the section chief. “Chances of those groups missing the services, including the routine vaccines, are always there. We will send health workers to the at-risk areas to find such children.”Healthworkers found over 74,000 children out of school nationwide during the measles-rubella campaign launched in February. “We are aware of the children who are out of school,” said Gautam. “Floating population, scattered slums, working-class people, lack of awareness and poor access to health workers are major challenges to health workers. We will send health workers to the areas designated as risk zones.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but the World Health Organisation officially gave the status on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV). The trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine contains all three types of poliovirus: Type-1, Type-2, and Type-3. The current oral poliovirus vaccine is made up of live, attenuated poliovirus. The trivalent poliovirus vaccine was effective against all three types of poliovirus. However, the Type-2 component of this vaccine can lead to the circulation of vaccine-derived viruses. Its use was linked to a vaccine associated with paralytic polio, a condition in which children develop paralysis.Nepal became the first country in South Asia to incorporate the IPV vaccine in its routine immunisation programme in line with the UN health body’s endgame strategic plan to eliminate the risk of vaccine-derived poliovirus and phase out all oral polio vaccines in the routine immunisation programme.IPV consists of inactivated poliovirus strains of all three poliovirus types.Health officials say that children should continuously receive the bivalent poliovirus vaccine, even if they are administered the IPV vaccine, as the bivalent poliovirus vaccine is also necessary for intestinal immunity, while IPV provides mucosal immunity.The government's number one priority is childhood immunisation, under which 13 types of vaccines are given free of charge against a range of diseases, including measles-rubella, pneumonia, tuberculosis, diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, hepatitis B, rotavirus, Japanese encephalitis, and typhoid, under the regular immunisation programme.Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, with a high coverage rate. The country has demonstrated remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programme is credited with that.However, the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of the children aged between 12 and 23 months received no vaccine at all. This figure was one percent in 2016. The Ministry of Health and Population said that the nationwide vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 percent. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City on Saturday dumped a truckload of dirt and trash outside the Road Division Kathmandu office, claiming that the delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work, Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media. Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The widening of the 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be carried out by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start from early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.Earlier, in January 2019, the Chinese government had handed over the 10.5 km eight-lane Koteshwar-Kalanki section of the Ring Road to the Nepal government.This is not the first time Mayor Shah has issued such a warning to the federal government and other state agencies.In April last year, the metropolis office stopped collecting garbage from Singha Durbar, the central secretariat of the federal government, and other VIP addresses such as the Office of the President at Sheetal Niwas and prime minister’s residence at Baluwatar. At the time, he had said that wasn’t a decision made on a whim but was rather a result of the “neglect, lack of responsibility and carelessness shown by the federal government”. \nAmid a rise in pre-monsoon rainfall activities, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley have reported a surge in snakebites, fever, diarrhoea and jaundice cases.Doctors anticipate more cases of the ailments in the coming days, as the monsoon is about to start. This is considered an epidemic season, in which hundreds of thousands of people get infected with water-borne and vector-borne diseases and snakebites.“Over six to eight snakebite victims seek treatment in our hospital daily,” said Dr Bimal Sharma Chalise of Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “Number of patients seeking snakebite treatment has gone up after a rise in rainfall activities.”Along with water-borne and vector-borne diseases, snakebites and resulting deaths are common in Nepal during the rainy season.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snake bites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.Along with snakebite cases,the number of patients infected with diarrheal ailments, fever and jaundice has also risen in the hospital.“Most of the snakebite victims seeking care at our hospital are either from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from the districts adjoining the Valley,” said Chalise. “Most of the snakebite victims are farmers, women and children who work or play in the fields or go to the jungle to collect fodder for their cattle.”Diarrhoeal disease is a common and seasonal public health issue usually triggered by food and water safety or hygiene issues. The disease, which has been associated with higher temperatures, is one of Nepal’s leading causes of morbidity and mortality.Doctors at the hospital say around half a dozen diarrheal patients are also seeking treatment every day. Similarly, patients having jaundice and fever due to typhoid are also seeking care at the hospital.Typhoid fever, usually called typhoid, is a highly contagious disease caused by Salmonella typhi, which spreads through contaminated food or water. Studies have shown that the disease can be fatal in up to 10 percent of the reported cases.Typhoid fever has been found throughout the world, but the problem is acute in areas without safe drinking water and sanitation. Nepal has also recorded major typhoid outbreaks in the past, but very few cases have been reported in the last few years.Nepal introduced the typhoid vaccine in the routine vaccination programme in 2022.The Ministry of Health and Population launched a month-long nationwide vaccination campaign against typhoid, during which around seven million children between the ages of 15 months and 15 years were inoculated.“Cases of water-borne diseases and snakebite have started to spike of late,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Hospital. “We should all be cautious about the food and water we eat and drink. We must ensure that food and water is safe before eating.”Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive against the risks. They say that people living in thatched-roof houses are also highly vulnerable to snakebite, as snakes visit such homes in search of rats. They say that people should be asked to keep their houses and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in the bush, avoid walking at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.“Most of the water resources get contaminated during monsoon season, as rainwater gets mixed in the water resources,” Pun said. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City said it has been verifying new names proposed to be adopted by private schools known by foreign names.Officials at the Education Department of the metropolis said that at least 128 schools have proposed new names and sought the department’s approval to be renamed.“Some of the schools have also changed names through the Office of the Company Registrar and requested us to approve the new name,” said Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the metropolis. “Other schools, too, are ready to change their names but are unable to decide due to some technical problems.”The City office had issued an ultimatum in the last week of March to 324 institutional schools operating within its jurisdiction to change their foreign names within 35 days. As per Rule 154 (1) of the Education Regulations, 2059 (2002), and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018, schools must adopt names that reflect the Nepali identity.The City office had asked the schools to choose names of renowned persons who have contributed significantly to the country, popular cultural icons, historical places and deities, and from religious mythology and pilgrimage sites.According to Manandhar, schools running +2 and bachelor programmes have not been able to decide on the new names, as they are confused about what to do with certificate-missing students [issue duplicate documents in the old names or new ones].“We will hold a meeting of all stakeholders, including representatives of schools and experts, and decide on solutions to the problems,” said Manandhar. “As all schools operating in the metropolis are ready to abide by the rules, we will help them sort out their problems.”Officials said that all schools operating in the KMC with foreign names had contacted them and expressed their readiness to rename.They had warned that the metropolis would not dispatch school inspectors during board examinations to those schools that failed to change their foreign names within the deadline. This could make the examinations conducted by such schools invalid.The metropolis said that out of the over 850 schools operating in the metropolis, 324 have foreign names. Enforcing the Education Regulations 2002 and Rule (70) of the KMC School Education Management Regulations 2018 is part of the municipal effort to improve school education. The metropolis has also started training over 2,000 teachers of government schools within its area of scope.Officials hope that the skill training for teachers will help improve the quality of education and the learning outcome in government schools and make the students there more competent.The City office has already started book-free Fridays in schools. People’s representatives from many local governments have shown interest in the initiative. Under the programme, students from grades 9 to 12 are taught optional short-term courses covering topics including agriculture and urban farming, cosmetology, carpentry and wood-carving, culinary arts, fashion design and clothing, electrical wiring, disaster preparedness, mobile and electronics repair, plumbing, stitching, and sculpture.The metropolis has also introduced an integrated curriculum for grades 1 to 3, under which interlinked subjects are taught. Officials said they are also incorporating extracurricular activities—music, poem recitation, essay writing, growing plants, and waste management, among other skills—into the curricula of grades 4 to 8 for the mental and physical growth of students. \nNepal Police has busted a gang allegedly involved in swindling youths of Rs55 million promising to send them to the United States and Canada through illegal routes.Kathmandu Valley Crime Investigation Office made them public amidst a press conference in Kathmandu on Friday.The arrestees have been identified as Tashi Sherpa, 47, Dimbuti Sherpa, 42, and Nima Sherpa, 19, of Sindhupalchok, according to Senior Superintendent of Police Sanuram Bhattarai.According to him, they allegedly duped ten people of Rs55 million.Meanwhile, a total of 15 Nepalis have been held hostage in different countries including Kenya on their way to the US and it has come to light that the gang took around Rs75 million from them as well. \nNepal on Friday confirmed the spread of the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4 in the country.All the sub-variants are offshoots of the Omicron variant, which is considered responsible for the surge in new cases of coronavirus in the last few weeks.The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of coronavirus-infected persons, said that 31 out of 42 swab samples tested positive for different sub-lineages.According to a statement issued by the laboratory, the KP.2 sub-variant was confirmed in 17 swab samples, KP.1 in 12, and KP.3 and KP.4 in one sample each. Similarly, Omicron’s JN.1 was detected in 7 swab samples, and BA.2 was detected in 2 swab samples.“The Omicron’s variants JN.1 and KP.2 have high prevalence, which accounts for nearly 40 percent of samples run for sequencing,” reads the statement.The KP.2 is a member of a group of SARS-CoV-2 variants, also called “FliRT” variants.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe that whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus's severity and properties.Nepal confirmed the spread of the JN.1 sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country in January. Given its rapid spread around the globe, the World Health Organisation classifies JN.1 as a separate ‘variant of interest’. However, the UN health body said that based on available data, “the additional public health risk posed by JN.1 is currently evaluated as low”.The UN health body has classified KP.2 as a variant under monitoring. There is no indication that KP.1 and KP.2 are more transmissible or cause more severe disease than other circulating variants. Swab samples were collected from Covid-infected persons in April and May, according to the laboratory.Hospitals in Kathmandu had reported a surge in serious cases of Covid infection in April. Doctors attending the infected patients had said that elderly people and those with underlying conditions were getting severe.Health authorities nationwide have stopped active case findings, including contact tracing and free testing for all, after the second wave of the pandemic subsided in 2021. Hospitals have been carrying out tests only on those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing to go abroad or seriously ailing patients with respiratory illness. Several countries, including India and Singapore, have reported infection with the KP.2 and KP.1 sub-variants of the coronavirus. According to media reports, India has recorded 324 cases of Covid, including 290 cases of KP.2 and 34 cases of KP.1.Experts say almost all variants of the coronavirus present in India have found their way into Nepal. Even if the JN.1 sub-variant is not as deadly as the Delta variant, the virus still poses a serious threat to the elderly and people with compromised immunity.Over 12,000 people died, and hundreds of thousands were infected in the first, second and third waves of the Covid pandemic. \nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nOver 1.46 million children born between April 2016 and October 2018 will be inoculated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV) during a nationwide immunisation drive starting next Sunday.Officials said, children who missed the IPV vaccine during the routine immunisation programme will be administered the vaccine, as they are at risk of getting infected with Type-2 polio.“All necessary preparations regarding IPV vaccination to the children deprived of the vaccine are being completed,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The vaccine will be administered in schools, booths and health posts.”Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After introducing the IPV vaccine in September 2014, the country switched to the bivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (bOPV0) from the trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (tOPV).

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nClimbing Nepal's towering mountains requires mental and physical resilience, proper preparation, expert guidance, and attention to safety for a successful ascent.\nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nKolkata Knight Riders lifted their third Indian Premier League (IPL) title with an eight-wicket thrashing of Sunrisers Hyderabad in a lop-sided final in Chennai on Sunday.Kolkata, who topped the group stage of the 10-team league, had beaten Hyderabad in the first qualifier on Tuesday and were even more dominant in the summit clash, which lasted 29 overs.Hyderabad captain Pat Cummins was left to rue his decision to bat first as his side got skittled out for 113 runs in 18.3 overs.Player-of-the-match Mitchell Starc produced a double strike while his new ball partner Vaibhav Arora dismissed the dangerous Travis Head for a first ball duck to rattle Hyderabad.Kolkata’s talismanic all-rounder Andre Russell claimed three crucial wickets, including those of South African Aiden Markram and rival captain Cummins, as Hyderabad wilted inside 19 overs.Defending the lowest total in an IPL final, Cummins removed Sunil Narine in the second over but the miracle they needed did not materialise.Venkatesh Iyer, who smashed an unbeaten 52 off 26 balls, and Rahmanullah Gurbaz (39) helped Kolkata romp home in 10.3 overs in front of a sea of purple jerseys that included franchise co-owner and Bollywood star Shah Rukh Khan.“No words to describe (the feeling). It means so much,” West Indies stalwart Russell said wiping away tears.“I am happy that all of us were very disciplined and worked towards one goal. This franchise has done a lot for me. It's a big gift from all of us to them.”It was a special night for Kolkata mentor Gautam Gambhir, who captained the franchise to IPL titles in 2012 and 2014.“I thought they (Kolkata) bowled fantastically. Obviously not enough (from Hyderabad) tonight... They didn’t give us anything,” Cummins said of his side’s batting effort.“It was a tricky wicket. I didn’t feel it was like a 200-plus wicket. I think 160 would have given us a chance.”Royal Challengers Bengaluru crashed out in the playoffs but stalwart Virat Kohli won the orange cap as the league’s leading scorer with 741 runs from 15 matches.Punjab Kings seamer Harshal Patel won the purple cap for the league’s most successful bowler with 24 wickets from 14 matches even though his team did not make the playoffs.Kolkata’s Narine was adjudged the season’s Most Valuable Player for his all-round brilliance. \nThe Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) on Wednesday said it has requested the prime minister and the foreign ministry to take initiatives to help Sandeep Lamichhane get a US visa.The Embassy of the United States of America in Nepal had denied visa to Lamichhane, who is preparing to travel to the country and the West Indies to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup.Lamichhane took to social media to to say his visa application had been rejected.“And the US Embassy, Nepal did it again like they did back in 2019, they denied my visa for the T20 World Cup happening in the US and the West Indies. Unfortunate. I am sorry to all the well wishers of Nepal Cricket,” Lamichhane wrote.Lamichhane was cleared to participate in domestic and international cricket tournaments as the country’s cricket governing body lifted his suspension, hours after the Patan High Court acquited him of rape conviction by a district court.CAN had suspended Lamichhane from both domestic and international cricket after initially being found guilty of raping a girl.The Kathmandu District Court on December 29, 2023 convicted Lamichhane of raping a girl and sentenced him to eight years in prison on January 11.He was cleared to play following the verdict.“We have already requested the prime minister, the foreign ministry and other stakeholders to take initiatives in getting Lamichhane a visa for the US,” Chatur Bahadur Chand, the CAN president, told the Post.“The visa was rejected despite the application being attached with the high court’s order and letters from the International Cricket Council and CAN,” Chand added.“It is a matter of concern for the country. But we are hopeful he will get a visa.”The US Embassy said they could not comment on individual visa cases.“The US Embassy is extremely excited to have Nepal's men’s national cricket team, the Rhinos, participating in the T20 World Cup in the United States and, in fact, a few Embassy officials met with them a few weeks ago to appreciate and encourage them before they headed out. We are wishing the entire team the best in the coming games,” the US Embassy said.“US Embassy Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”CAN has reached out to the ICC to include Lamichhane in Nepal’s T20 World Cup squad.Lamichhane has been training regularly at the TU Cricket Ground.It is not the first time the US has denied him a visa. Lamichhane’s visa application was rejected by the US in 2019 for the Caribbean Premier League. He had taken the issue to Twitter (now X) to express his dissatisfaction over the visa denial. However, a few hours after his post, the embassy had called Lamichhane and given him a visa.Nepal had already announced their provisional 15-man squad for the World Cup when Lamichhane’s rape conviction was quashed.The Nepali team are already in the West Indies and have been training in St Vincent. ICC allows all 20 participating teams of the global showpiece to make changes and submit their final squad until May 25.The Rhinos played a three-match T20 practice series against Windwards Volcanoes, which they won 2-1. They will play warm-up matches against Canada and the US on May 27 and May 30 before launching their World Cup campaign against the Netherlands on June 4.Nepal are making their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nUS Embassy in Kathmandu denies visa to Nepal cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane, preventing him from participating in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup despite his acquittal in a rape case.\nAmidst a heatwave likely worsened by climate change, Pakistan's Sindh province recorded the summer's highest temperature of 52.2°C, approaching the country's record and significantly impacting daily life and businesses.\nIsraeli airstrike kills 35 in Gaza, sparking condemnation as Israel maintains offensive despite international outcry and UN ruling demanding halt.\nA massive landslide in Papua New Guinea has buried over 2,000 people, with treacherous terrain and instability hindering rescue efforts and raising concerns about survivor prospects.\nUnauthorized translations and pirated books by renowned authors, including Taslima Nasrin, are prevalent in Nepal's book market, raising concerns about copyright infringement, poor quality translations, and the harm to authors, readers, and the publishing industry.\nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nIn our previous article, \"Regulatory gaps in Nepal’s fintech\" (March 14, 2024), we discussed some regulatory gaps in fintech. In this piece, we will focus on the regulatory gaps primarily related to cybersecurity and data protection that the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) must quickly address. The fintech ecosystem in Nepal is growing, but it remains fragile in terms of cybersecurity and data protection. The NRB regulation should promote fintech innovation while also considering the importance of data protection and security.Technology is evolving, and so are cyber-attacks. In 2019, hackers stole almost Rs18.9 million from 13 Nepali banks using ATM terminals. They spoofed the Nepal Electronic Payment Systems Limited (NEPS) link using fake cards, which enabled them to take money from the ATMs by independently verifying all the information of the Nepal bank's clients. This incident was one of the most prominent cases of cross-banking transactions via ATM cash-out hack and could happen again. Hence, the NRB should be aware of such incidents. The court decided to punish the perpetrators; however, as it wasn’t physical loot, a detailed investigation to find out the root cause would have been an appropriate step by the central bank. Such investigations could provide insights and further strengthen the system security of such companies and bank and financial institutions in Nepal.Clause 44 of the Payment and Settlement Bylaw, 2077 (First Amendment, 2080) addresses the liability of the payment system operators (PSO)/payment service providers (PSP) in case of any disputes or any other loss arising from incidents such as cyber-attacks. However, the absence of explicit guidance regarding the extent of liability raises concerns. For instance, a PSO with a paid-up capital of Rs50 million must be given clear guidelines on their liability in the worst-case scenario, or there must be a limit on how much of their customers’ funds they can retain. Additionally, it is the right time to introduce a government guarantee fund, like the deposit and credit guarantee fund (DCGF), to protect the public from loss arising from data breaches and other cyber incidents. If the government had set up such funds, it would have been more vigilant and strict on cybersecurity measures. This would be a win-win situation for all parties.Furthermore, no insurance products are available in Nepal to hedge companies against any loss due to data breaches or similar security incidents. The lack of insurance coverage leaves companies vulnerable to hacking and losses. It might be appropriate for the regulator to open a pathway for companies in Nepal to obtain cyber insurance, even from foreign companies, until insurance companies in Nepal launch such products.Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw and Directive No. 3 of the NRB Unified Directive Related to Payment Systems, 2079, discusses the security policies and practices for PSO/PSP. Implementing a uniform requirement for payment card industry data security standard (PCI DSS) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 27,000 certifications across all financial institutions involved in payment processing would ensure a data protection baseline, mitigating the risks of cyber threats. The language of the Directive is clear: A licensed institution shall adhere to the standards of PCI DSS, Europay, Mastercard and Visa (EMV) Standard, EMV Contactless Standard, etc. However, a mechanism to ensure that these standards are followed is unclear. Had it been mentioned that certification like PCI DSS is mandatory, it would have made more sense since an independent third party always issues a certification. Similarly, regulatory requirements always act as the baseline for security, and these NRB guidelines are the minimum requirements spread across the industry. Further, data security is not a matter of securing them for a point of time only; it is a regular, ongoing activity that needs the attention of the stakeholders. Similarly, if we look through most payment-related companies’ websites, except for a few big players, we don’t find much information related to their security and related certifications.A provision requiring each licensed institution to disclose its licenses and certifications, commitment to data security, and other related matters on its website and update it regularly must be introduced to increase public awareness and invoke dialogues between the stakeholders. Similarly, Clause 45 of the Bylaw contains a provision for system audit while it also mentions a provision for an annual system audit. In contrast, the Directive states that a system audit is mandatory after a year of operation and every two years when there are no changes in the existing system. These two provisions contradict each other, and the regulator must provide clarification on the same. Two years to conduct a system audit is pretty long, and so payment-related institutions must conduct at least an annual system audit in light of the rise of cyber threats in the present context.Awareness of cyber threats and cybersecurity is a pressing need today since most occur due to human negligence. Social engineering is the most common way through which intruders can gather data and find loopholes in a payment system. To improve cyber risk measures, visibility is required on the organisation's risk dashboard, covering all inherent risk levels to provide a picture of what is being defended. Lastly, continuous monitoring and a proactive approach to risk management is the only way against cyber-attacks. The country’s payment industry is still in its infancy, and before something worse happens, all the stakeholders must join hands to protect the public’s interest. \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nThe emergence of a leader is possible through hard work, confidence, determination, ideas and identification with issues. Leaders are created by movements, long democratic practices and immediate events triggered by people’s frustration and anger. However, instant leaders are short-lived and fade away after they fail to imbibe perseverance, commitment and the qualities of being patient. Such leaders are soon seduced by power and privileges as their role is made for the time being. In Nepal, many ambitious youth have shown the characteristics of instant leaders who are easily exposed and stigmatised. Watching the Indian political scene for the last few years, it seems that it is the coming of age of Rahul Gandhi. Sooner or later, he will likely play a crucial role in Indian politics. Rahul’s rise is possible not because he happened to be a member of the Nehru-Gandhi family but because of his dedication, perseverance, hard work and the ability to be closer to the people of India. Rather than being elitist, he is perceived as people-centred and egalitarian in his mission and actions, contrary to his aristocratic family background. Rahul is evolving as a leader despite the humiliation and insinuation hurled at him by his opponents.His mission to unify India, accept unity in the diversity of Indian society and polity, and his steadfast commitment to safeguarding the Republican constitution by finding suitable guardrails have paid him rich dividends in recent elections. Whatever the results, he has surpassed all other country leaders, endearing himself to ordinary people. Born with a silver spoon, Rahul has unique personality traits. He has the knack of being humble; sometimes, he finds himself in ordinary train compartments, travelling with fellow travellers, shaving his beard in an ordinary salon in Rae Bareli, eating chhole-bhature in Delhi street, mixing with kids while undertaking the Bharat Jodo Yatra, or taking sweets in an ordinary shop somewhere in South India. These activities make him the darling of the masses. Narendra Damodar Modi, now the Prime Minister, by contrast, also has the humble background of being the son of a tea-seller at the Gujrat railway station and has emerged as a charismatic leader over time. Nevertheless, the taste of power that he enjoyed as a long-time chief minister of Gujrat and later as the country leader for over a decade seems to have transformed him into an elitist leader with a disposition for a luxurious life. However, Modi continues to be popular among his colleagues and has become the only star campaigner for his party during the three parliamentary elections in 2014, 2019 and 2024. Weary and exhausted, Modi’s charisma is declining due to his age and failure to deliver on the people’s basic needs. Moreover, India today is a highly polarised country, as the BJP government is criticised for using religion as a weapon to scare minorities, especially Muslims. The Hindutwa agenda is interpreted as the divisive doctrine propounded and practised by orthodox BJP leaders. Contrarily, Rahul has taken up this agenda, arguing that he wants to propagate love, not hatred, as he has been repeating since his long march from the deep South to Kashmir and Manipur to Maharastra. He has assured the people that he would not allow the constitution, which embraces the “unity in diversity” principle, to be destroyed. Though it may appear highly populist, his commitment to providing jobs to the unemployed youths, delivering Rs100,000 to women each year, rescuing the peasants from loans, and rejecting the Agniveer Programme that aims to offer four-year jobs in the army and Rs1.2 million to retire the young soldiers seems to be a daunting task for any government. However, his task force brings such agendas to the fore after careful assessment and thinking. Rahul has revived the moribund Congress Party by single-handedly setting the agendas of rejuvenation and presenting himself as a formidable competitor to Modi, who, to many, is seen as invincible. Many still think Rahul is a weak opponent in the face of the Modi craze, which prevails among elites and commoners alike. Since such a myth has started showing diminishing trends in the wake of the general elections of 2024, electoral predictions may prove wrong, as some election results in the past had nullified. Simmering underground trends cannot be easily fathomed by simple guesswork. It’s better to watch the unfolding developments. Nevertheless, a leader is born. Rahul has no experience in any governmental office except for his short tenure as party president. Even his father, Rajiv, had suddenly been thrown into politics by his mother, following the death of his brother, Sanjay, in a plane crash. But Rajiv’s track record in government was neither dismal nor superb. However, he was the one who initiated dialogues with China, reaching some sort of understanding of the management of the northern borders. Bilateral relations had improved until quite recently. Modi’s long handshake and warm embrace with the Chinese President, Xi Jinping, didn’t prolong due to the increasing tensions developing along the border, including the loss of army personnel. Leadership matters much in politics. A leader’s upbringing is as essential as his intelligence, commitment to values and mission. So, the wrong person in office destroys institutions, as is evident in the Nepali context. If a leader is strong and widespread, having all the traits of a democratic culture, he is destined to be successful. As Henry Kissinger writes, “Without leadership, institutions drift, and nations court growing irrelevance and, ultimately, disaster”. In Nepal, too, young leaders are in the making, and given the opportunity, they would definitely be good at governing the country. Yet, new leaders also need to be good educators, communicators and responsible. Mere procedural leaders have little sense in the dynamic context of politics. Rahul Gandhi has both a good education and a good apprenticeship in democracy, making him sensitive to the needs of the common people.    \nNepal on Wednesday and Thursday held an international dialogue on climate issues of mountainous countries. Titled “Mountains, People, and Climate Change,” it saw the participation of representatives from 23 countries gathered to strengthen coordination among mountain countries on climate change-related issues. The dialogue has been instrumental in positioning mountains at the centre of the global agenda and as a key negotiation block within the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). On Thursday itself, 22 people from Madhesh reached Kathmandu after a 25-day walk, calling for saving the Chure mountains. They have come with a 12-point charter of demands, which include saving the water sources, jungles and mountains in the Chure region apart from protecting the land itself.One of the most fragile mountain ranges in South Asia, the Chure range consists of low hills stretching from Mechi in the east to Mahakali in the west along the south of the Mahabharat hills. Around 20-30 km wide and 1,000 km long, the range is a lifeline for the Madhesh region, providing water, minerals and vegetation. However, the water sources originating from the foothills of Chure have dried up in recent years due to exploitation, leading to the depletion of the first layer of the underground water in the Bhawar and Madhesh regions. The depletion of water has already impacted people in Madhesh, with ponds, tube wells and hand pumps running dry.The culprits of the degradation of Chure are all too familiar: The sand, land and timber mafia that is only interested in making a profit and the three tiers of government that have no regard for the present and future of the nation and its citizens. But there has been little effort to stop the exploitation of the fragile mountains. As the Chure continues to turn into a desert, we are staring at a significant crisis of water and food scarcity.The President Chure-Tarai Madhes Conservation Area Programme has been making some significant interventions, especially related to water conservation, building ponds and irrigation channels. But these efforts have been too slow and inadequate considering the rapid deforestation and extraction in the region. The campaigners who have marched to Kathmandu say the foremost work the governments of all levels must do is to shut down the crusher and sand mining industries in the region. Moreover, they demand that the government declare Dilip Mahato, an activist who was killed by illegal sand miners, as the “First environmental martyr” of Nepal. What is significant about these campaigners is that they are not just activists speaking for an environmental cause, but victims of the impacts of environmental damage and face risks to their lives. The government must, therefore, listen to their demands and act to fulfil them.The campaigners for saving the Chure plan sit-ins at different places in Kathmandu—the common protest site at Maitighar as well as the offices of various political parties. The central government in Kathmandu, which is often too quick in manhandling protesters of all kinds, would do well to listen to the campaigners this time. They have come up with a message that is important not only for themselves but for the entire nation. The degradation of Chure impacts us all, and if we do not listen to the campaigners and act on time, we will be staring at a bleak future. \nAir pollution has plunged the world into a global public health crisis, and Nepal is no exception. The air we inhale for survival is one of the leading causes of illness, as reported by The Lancet, a medical journal. Respiratory diseases like pneumonia, bronchitis, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have become all too common now. Besides these, ulcers, lung and intestine cancer, kidney diseases, heart problems, and so on are attributed to bad air. The vulnerability of children, women, the elderly and underrepresented groups to air pollution adds to the urgency of its mitigation.The impact of toxic air is particularly harsh on Nepalis as our federal capital, Kathmandu, often tops the list of most polluted cities globally. Only a few weeks ago, Pokhara Metropolitan City’s air was unbreathable for several days. The southern plains met the same fate. This poor air quality has reduced our life expectancy by a staggering 4.6 years, as per the report by the Air Quality Life Index of the Energy Policy Institute at the University of Chicago. The situation is worse in nine southern districts (Mahottari, Rautahat, Dhanusha, Sarlahi, Bara, Parsa, Saptari, Siraha and Rupandehi). These areas, where air pollution is cutting lives short by 6.8 years, are affected mainly by India’s heavily polluted northern plains.As we faced yet another air pollution crisis this year, patients with respiratory illnesses flooded the hospitals across the country. For instance, as per a recent report in the Post, in its two days of weekly OPD clinics, more than 600 people with respiratory illness reportedly visit the Teaching Hospital in Maharajgunj, Kathmandu. Despite this, the government’s recent plans and policies didn’t address the crisis. We need not scratch our heads to understand why we still do not have a national standard for annual average particulate matter. Nepal exceeds the World Health Organization’s particulate matter recommendation, i.e., PM2.5, by 15 times, taking a toll on approximately 40,000 lives annually. Countries around the world have been trying their best to curb air pollution. Take our northern neighbour, China, which decreased toxic air by 42.3 percent between 2013 and 2021. A 2023 study by the University of Chicago suggests that if the country continues at the same pace, it will increase the average life expectancy of its people by 2.2 years. If Nepal meets the WHO guidelines and reduces the PM level, it can add 3.5 years to the lives of people living in Kathmandu. Even India and Pakistan are taking this matter seriously. This should inspire our leaders to take immediate national and transboundary actions to prevent deaths related to air pollution.Our current approaches to tackling this crisis are far from adequate. Even when the air pollution level rises, our focus centres mainly on Kathmandu, and we are too myopic to see its effects on the southern plains. Be it the capital or other districts, they should get equal priority, as clean air is a fundamental right of every citizen. We need nationwide awareness campaigns to mitigate the deadly wildfires, toxic air emanating from vehicles and industries, as well as open waste-burning. While we fare better in air quality monitoring than other countries facing this crisis, there is a critical gap in mitigation measures. The policy gap in air pollution should be rectified before it is too late.  \nHome Minister Rabi Lamichhane on Tuesday committed a gross abuse of his authority by sending Nepal Police to have Kailash Sirohiya, the chairman of Kantipur Media Group (KMG), which publishes The Kathmandu Post, arrested. Sirohiya was at work as police officers barged into his office at the KMG headquarters in Thapathali, Kathmandu.We have no objection with law enforcement officers fulfilling their duty as per the law of the land, and are committed to fully supporting the state in an impartial investigation on the alleged discrepancies in Sirohiya’s citizenship certificate. However, we are also cognisant of the politics of vendetta being pursued against Sirohiya by Home Minister Lamichhane, who has been riled by the consistent, fact-based reporting of Kantipur, our sister publication, on his alleged involvement in cooperative frauds.Coming on the heels of the persistent calls for a parliamentary probe into his alleged frauds, Lamichhane has made no secret of his intention to play the politics of vendetta against the KMG. This is not the first time Lamichhane has launched an attack against the group. Over a year ago, as he struggled to salvage his image in the wake of the case against dual citizenship, Lamichhane opened a barrage of unsubstantiated allegations against KMG. That Lamichhane has a grudge against the group for fulfilling its duty of fearless, factual reporting is thus well-documented.But the home minister’s action against KMG should not be taken as a singular event. It is, rather, an attack on press freedom through the misuse of state machinery, and it is going to set a dangerous precedent. It is ironic that Lamichhane, a former mediaperson, has taken an authoritarian approach of punishing another mediaperson for unfavourable reporting about him. In having Sirohiya arrested, Lamichhane has exposed his undemocratic character as a politician.Sirohiya’s arrest takes us back to the early 2000s, when press freedom was at an awfully low point. In 2001, the then government had arrested Kantipur Publications publishers Kailash Sirohiya and Binod Raj Gyawali as well as Kantipur Editor-In-Chief Yubaraj Ghimire on the grounds of publishing an opinion article that it considered “objectionable”. Later, in 2005, when King Gyanendra Shah imposed dictatorial rule, he sent the country's army and police forces to the newsrooms of Kantipur and The Kathmandu Post, along with dozens of other newsrooms in the Kathmandu valley and elsewhere in the country to ensure that no negative news about the government could be published. Over almost three decades of its service to the nation, the private media houses in Nepal, with Kantipur Publications at its head, have repeatedly stood up to injustices and defended the rights of the citizens—and they will continue to report on corruption cases such as the one the home minister is embroiled in. The politics of vendetta and fear has never worked in favour of authoritarian regimes, and it will not work this time around. The Nepali media has never bowed down to the politics of fear and, rest assured, we will continue to fulfil our duty of informing the citizens without fear or favour.  \nAmnesty International’s Secretary General Agnès Callamard was in Nepal last week as a part of her first South Asian tour. During her four-day visit, she interacted with people from all walks of life, including the prime minister, in an attempt to gauge the human rights situation here. In this interview with Binod Ghimire of the Post, Callamard talked about the human rights situation in Nepal and the rest of the world. Excerpts: You have been travelling this part of the world, interacting with people. How do you evaluate the human rights situation here?Human rights are backsliding everywhere. It’s a global phenomenon. There is backsliding on civil and political rights, freedom of expression, press freedom and freedom of peaceful assembly. There is backsliding on women’s rights and non-discrimination on economic rights, and in terms of armed conflicts. The number of people dying in armed conflicts is increasing exponentially. We are in deep trouble as far as human rights protection is concerned. The South Asia region hasn’t been immune to the global trend.For my mission, I am visiting Sri Lanka and Nepal. In the two countries, we observe the shrinking of civic space and greater weaponisation of laws to curtail freedom of expression, particularly online. The digital laws are often overbroad and disproportionate. Banning TikTok in Nepal, for instance, is a disproportionate overbroad measure of the violation of international laws. We are observing a great deal of attacks in protests. The use of lethal force or disproportionate use of force by the police in response to even peaceful protests is increasing. There are incidents where protestors have died after the use of police force. There are issues of impunity for past crimes. A study by a European research centre shows that fewer people live in democracies worldwide in 2024 than in 1986. This is a complete U-turn. What do you see as the reasons for the backsliding? There are several factors that explain the backsliding. One could be growing restlessness and anxiety due to economic downturns. There was a severe financial crisis in 2008, and we didn't really recover from it. The inequalities within states and between states have increased in the last decade. We have seen a sharp increase in the wealth of the super-rich. On the other hand, the poor are getting poorer. This is feeding anger and creating fertile ground for populism. The authoritarian leaders are feeding on that particular ground. The backsliding is also linked to Covid that had a terrible impact on the economy and society. During Covid, the governments adopted different emergency measures but, in many cases, those measures were never lifted. In Europe, refugees, migrants and minorities are viewed as the reasons why the economy is not picking up and they are accused of stealing jobs. In every country, the minorities have been made the scapegoats. There is a resentment that democracy has not delivered for the people. The expectations are high, but the governments have failed to act accordingly. Therefore, the people are prepared to listen to the authoritarian leaders. By authoritarian leaders, I do not mean those who are in power by force but those who are democratically elected. They are elected by the people, but they practise authoritarianism once they get into power. In Nepal, the burning problem of authoritarianism has been reflected even in local politics. For instance, the mayor of Kathmandu has resorted to repeated attacks against street vendors and landless people. These are authoritarian moves. Such leaders target vulnerable groups who cannot protect themselves. You are in Nepal at a time the government has arrested the owner of the largest media house. How does Amnesty International look at this situation?We are very alarmed and upset. We call on the government to release him immediately. Even if the charges are valid, they certainly do not justify imprisoning him. Amnesty International believes that the use of those charges is politically motivated and is an attempt to stifle dissent. It is a response to the professional investigation and reporting about the policies and practices of those in power. This is an attempt to silence him, to silence the news media and to silence journalists. By so doing, the authorities are also violating the rights of the Nepali society to access information at a time when they need that kind of information. The attack on Sirohiya is an act of reprisal, censorship and violation of his own rights and the right of the Nepali people to freedom of information and freedom of press, which is also a collective form of rights.We believe that he might have been arrested in relation to the reporting of financial fraud by people in power. Many people with whom I have interacted say that that safe space of expression is shrinking in Nepal. There are incidents where people have been arrested for criticising people in authority.Unregulated generative artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a big threat. How can it be regulated?Globally, information technology and AI present many opportunities for people. But they also present risks. Amnesty International has focused on the risks. We have identified discrimination and biases. Data upon which some of these AI tools are based are inherently biased. They are based on a sample of a certain group of people, which can not be the ground for effective policy making. We are campaigning against the use of AI for facial recognition for mass surveillance. It is a violation of the freedom of movement and freedom of privacy, and many communities around the world are disproportionately affected.We have done several studies that show that mass surveillance and facial recognition are used in the most impoverished African-American communities in the United States, Muslim communities in India and Palestinian communities in Israel and occupied territories. Cyber surveillance and spyware are other problems which have been widely used to target journalists and human rights defenders, as well as opponents. We have been demanding that spyware be regulated. So far, this has been excluded from different regulations related to information technology.Generative AI has huge implications for the world, societies and human beings. Currently, only the European Union has made attempts to regulate it by adopting an AI Act last December. This is imperfect but is a first step. We have criticised it because it excludes cyber surveillance and the use of AI for security purposes, and it doesn’t stop the use of AI targeted at refugees and migrants. Nevertheless, other aspects of the law are positive. Do you think other countries should follow the European Union’s footsteps?Yes, they can build on it without going below the benchmark. We encourage all countries to prepare and enact better laws. We are calling on governments to take it as an example, but after correcting the shortcomings.Why do you think Nepal’s transitional justice process has been stuck? What can human rights organisations like Amnesty do to push it forward?Sadly, the transitional justice process hasn’t progressed in several countries. I think the leaders are so keen to preserve the peace that they are prepared to give up on justice. They fear that if they open the gate to judicial reparation and investigation, what has been achieved so far will be dismantled. That’s the fear that I have seen everywhere. Everywhere, including in Nepal, the leaders create opposition between peace and justice.You can see many governments are opposing the International Criminal Court prosecutors’ arrest warrant in relation to Gaza, saying it will create problems in agreeing on a ceasefire. This is nonsense.Peace and justice are two sides of the same coin. In fact, peace is not sustainable without justice. When justice is not delivered, the conflict is bound to recur. It is just a matter of time. We often hear the excuse that if a particular leader or a person is prosecuted, that would affect peace. On the contrary, not investigating the perpetrator is a real challenge to peace. Many people who are in power after a peace deal themselves are guilty of war crimes. They don’t want to be held accountable. It is not in their interest to deliver transitional justice. It takes an incredible, highly moral and principled leadership to take the process ahead.We have seen here that the transitional justice process has been paralysed. Successive governments have failed to act on the Comprehensive Peace Accord. They haven’t acted on what the Supreme Court told them in 2015. It had directed them to review, revise and reform the Transitional Justice Act.Here I have seen the categorisation of crimes as serious and non-serious, which is very strange. It is shocking to me that some killings are considered non-serious, and could lead to de facto amnesty for those responsible for them, even though these crimes fall under international law. If someone was killed after torture then two crimes have been committed—torture and killing. Right to life is the most important right. The investigation should be done accordingly. The same is the case with sexual violence with rape and without rape.What is alarming is that people are losing trust. If people do not trust the systems that are supposed to deliver justice, that will cause a big problem. The Truth and Reconciliation Commission and the Commission of Investigation on Enforced Disappeared Persons couldn’t undertake proper investigation and prosecution. Not all have received the government’s relief, which has led to much frustration and animosity. There is political interference on transitional justice, which also lacks independence and transparency.We are calling on the authorities to act as directed by the Supreme Court, ratify the statute on the International Criminal Court as well as the International Convention on Disappearance. Do you see chances of international interference if Nepal continues to delay justice delivery?There is no doubt that some crimes committed during the war fall within universal jurisdiction. If the perpetrators of those crimes travel to countries where a framework of universal jurisdiction has been enacted, they could be arrested there. We are seeing the multiplication of universal jurisdiction cases in Europe.Cases of custodial deaths, torture and extrajudicial killings are common in Nepal. How can they be checked?Different organisations like Amnesty International should be monitoring the abuse of power by the police and state authorities. There must be impartial and fair investigation of such incidents. But there is a regime of impunity. The police are not very keen to investigate themselves. I wanted to mention the case of Ajit Mijar, which is an example of justice being denied. It also shows the complicity of the institution in denying justice.Nepal is ranked the fourth most vulnerable country due to climate change though it contributes negligibly in greenhouse gas emissions. The largest polluters haven't fulfilled their responsibilities towards Nepal. How can organisations like Amnesty advocate for countries like Nepal?Amnesty International has long been advocating for climate justice. We have a set of demands. We are advocating at the United Nations level and also at the COP. We are pushing through COP our message of loss and damage, about the responsibilities of industrialised countries to cut their reliance on fossil fuel industries and so on. The impact of global warming will lead to loss of lives in places like Nepal and Pacific Islands.We saw very timid steps taken in COP in UAE last year. These steps are far from sufficient. We see countries multiplying their investments in fossil fuel while big fossil fuel companies are also violating their written commitment to decrease the reliance on fossil fuels. This is alarming.However, we have made some progress on loss and damage. Governments are recognising the principle of loss and damage for the countries that are least responsible for climate change. They can rely on some kind of global financial system to protect and support them in case of a sudden climate related crisis. We are now advocating for the responsible countries to set aside the necessary funds.Nepal is at the receiving end of climate change though the country is not responsible for it. However, the Nepali government also has a responsibility towards its people. The extreme weather risk faced by Nepal demands urgent acts from the authorities. The most vulnerable communities are at particular risk. The government must have instruments to protect them.  \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), which was fashioned in 2021 by a splinter faction of the CPN-UML, is preparing to hold its first general convention. The party has done poorly in all elections since its establishment. It has also failed in service delivery despite continuously being in the government since its inception. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal caught up with the party’s General Secretary, Ghanashyam Bhusal, for insights about the Unified Socialist’s upcoming general convention and broader political dynamics. Your party is holding its first general convention in a few weeks. What new things does the party have to offer?Our party was born in the context of sharp division between political forces over the issue of Parliament dissolution by then prime minister KP Sharma Oli, chairman of the CPN-UML, which was then also our party. That was the immediate reason for the party split. But there were other disputes within the UML. The differences were about the political line and party orientation. After Oli’s election as the party leader, policy issues were undermined. In fact, we were at odds because of the policy issues.What were those policy disputes?We [our faction] believed that after the establishment of democratic republic system, the fight for a political system was almost over as this is the most progressive political system of our time. We stressed that now the political line and programmes of the party should be updated and the focus shifted to attaining prosperity. Democracy can’t be sustained if we can’t promote industry, create jobs and ensure good governance. So we have to orient our policies to ensure these achievements. In our country, comprador capitalists, who want to earn money without running industries, are dominant. They shift the state’s policies in collusion with politicians, bureaucrats, police and other state agencies. Likewise, the economic policy doesn’t talk about jobs and production but only growth and development. These factors are detrimental to our economy. We wanted to change these policies and dynamics. We had differences on these issues with Oli. When we were debating them with him, the Parliament dissolution created a sort of abnormal situation. We stood against it, defying our party chief Oli. That division eventually led to the party split. Many people, including leaders in our own party, saw Parliament dissolution as the only reason behind the birth of our party. The new party was confused about the way forward. The upcoming general convention will formulate clear policies in this connection. What about the leadership? Will the party get new leadership?For the past two decades, I have been advocating that a communist party should adopt the right programmes to bring about social changes. At the time, the Maoists had a policy of seizing state power through force, and the UML was talking only about transforming society through elections. But the UML was basically engaged only in winning elections. In this context, we [a group of UML leaders] came up with some policies that would make substantive changes in such ritualistic practices.Now, I have been saying that our party should be led by a leader who can internalise and effectively implement those policies. We have almost finalised the party’s policy documents. When the documents are circulated among party workers, the debate about who is eligible to implement these policies will start.You often claim to be the proponent of the CPN (Unified Socialist)’s party line. If so, will you claim party leadership to implement those policies?The first condition to become the party leader is that he/she should internalise the policies and programmes adopted by the party. I shouldn’t say that no one besides me has internalised them. It is true that I have been actively leading the debates and discussions to introduce new policies in the party. Party representatives will debate and decide this at the convention.A large number of senior leaders quit the UML to form this party. But it couldn’t even retain its members let alone further expand.There was a need for radical reforms and restructuring in communist organisations and their policies. This should have been done by the country’s largest communist party—the CPN-UML. But the party leadership and its rank and file didn’t realise the need for it. There was no serious policy discussion in the UML. While the leadership of the CPN (Unified Socialist) and its organisation are oriented in the right direction, it’s not properly trained for such restructuring. Therefore, many even accused the party leadership of being just a follower and subservient to the Nepali Congress and the Maoist Centre. Various sections of society who had praised us for standing against Oli’s wrong decision didn’t appreciate other political moves of our party. Parliament dissolution was a political event. A party needs clear programmes and agenda to keep public support. Unfortunately, we were found wanting in this regard. We should have done something in job creation and increasing production. We will make such things clear at the upcoming convention. Since its formation, the party has been constantly bickered over power sharing with other parties and even party leaders always seem to be wrangling for ministerial berths. Don’t you think such activities weaken the party?This happened as the party lacked clear policies to move ahead. Standing against Oli became sort of its policy as there was deep resentment against him. As far as the leaders’ attachment to power is concerned, the party was born out of power [from Parliament, not from the ground]. So the struggle for power is linked to its genesis. It has been in power ever since its establishment. These allegations were hence natural, and the party leadership couldn’t clarify things. We couldn’t show what we did for the betterment of the society.Party chair Madhav Kumar Nepal and other top leader Jhalanath Khanal seem to be working at cross-purposes. Nepal seems closer to the Congress while Khanal has been consistently lobbying for an alliance with the UML and the Maoist Centre.We have almost resolved this issue in the course of finalising the party’s policy document. Our conclusion is that, in general, the Congress mainly represents neoliberals and comprador capitalists. When we lobby for the country’s independent economic policy, the Congress may not agree. The party tilts more towards pro-western ideas in the name of liberalism. We in our party are in consensus that in the long-run we will compete against the Congress. But we shouldn’t forget that we got the current democratic system and the constitution only after fighting jointly with the Congress. So we have to keep our doors open for collaboration with the Congress in order to safeguard this system and the constitution. It is also historically proven that the Congress and left forces should stand together to safeguard democratic system. Thus we have now made our theoretical standing clearer.But in practical aspects, as you said, there are some differences. Party chair doesn’t want to increase distance with the Congress as he worked closely with Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and other leaders to fight Oli ji. But Jhalanath Khanal ji is for left alliance.While there are already major communist forces such as the CPN-UML and the Maoist Centre, why is one more communist force, CPN (Unified Socialist), needed? How do you prove your relevance?The CPN-UML didn’t follow the right policies, even those endorsed by its general conventions. Party chief Oli wants total control of the party organisation, from the centre to the local units. The entire party is mobilised mainly to realise Oli’s personal ambitions. This party can’t work in favour of the society in the long run. The Maoist Centre hasn’t succeeded in transforming itself from war-era rigidity of Maoism. The Unified Socialist is here to correct these two major deviations of Nepal’s communist movement. Had the party raised this issue prominently right since its formation, people would have understood its relevance. We will do it now. This convention will be a landmark event in this connection as well. Many people think that the Unified Socialist will ultimately merge with the UML.Merger is not a solution. Even if you want to bring two parties together, you have to unify them. A merger brings top leaders together based on power sharing, just like the merger of the UML and Maoist Centre in 2018. Such a merger is guided mainly by the interests of certain leaders. That’s why the merger didn’t last. The need now is unification among communist parties based on policies and programmes. Otherwise, it will be nothing more than a gathering of leaders. There is no point in merging the party to make the UML bigger and make Oli prime minister one more time.As a leader of a ruling coalition partner, how confident are you of the stability of this alliance?Given the composition of the present Parliament, we can’t rule out the making and breaking of different coalitions until the next election. Oli ji used to talk of the Unified Socialist as a tumour removed after a surgery. His mindset that he can do anything in Nepali politics has suffered a setback. Therefore, he became ready for this coalition. If he has realised this change, this coalition will last. But if he again tries to manoeuvre to justify his dissolution of Parliament and serve any other interests, there might even be other coalitions.Why has your party been in a state of disharmony with coalition partners right from the beginning?Initially, the prime minister didn’t consult with us while making this coalition. That created misunderstanding. He eventually admitted his mistake in failing to inform us on time and sought our support. So, that chapter was closed. Now we have no issue at the party’s level, and officially, we are committed to this coalition. \nUnited Nations Resident Coordinator in Nepal Hanaa Singer-Hamdy has worked for close to 30 years across development and humanitarian contexts in senior management and strategic leadership roles. Before coming to Nepal, she served as the UN Resident Coordinator in Sri Lanka from 2018 to 2022. Previously, she also worked as UNICEF Chief in Nepal. She talks about the UN’s evolving role in Nepal’s development and peace endeavours in this extensive interview with the Post’s Anil Giri. You returned to Nepal as the United Nations Resident Coordinator nine years after your previous assignment as the UNICEF Chief. What changes have you found in all these intervening years? It is a pleasure coming back to beloved Nepal, a country that I came to know quite profoundly during my first tenure having travelled over 54 of its districts through the mountains, hills, and the Tarai. I have witnessed firsthand its beautiful landscape and diversity of people, culture, religion, perseverance for prosperity and social justice, openness, and resilience. Therefore, coming back to the country and the people I always loved was an honour and a wish come true. A lot has changed in Nepal in the past decade. Despite the devastating 2015 earthquake, the Covid-19 pandemic, and the impact of the global economic slowdown, Nepal underwent significant social and political changes. Coming out of the peace-building process, Nepal adopted the new constitution in 2015, transitioning to federalism and bringing a shared sense of hope and optimism to its people. Nepal has also achieved remarkable progress in development in recent decades. From a significant reduction in the number of people living in poverty to a decline in maternal and child mortality rates, alongside notable improvements in nutrition and reductions in stunting. Life expectancy, school enrollment rates and access to drinking water and sanitation have also increased. The expansion of roads, communications and air transport infrastructure reflects the country's commitment to increased interconnectedness. These collective advancements have elevated Nepal’s Human Development Index (HDI) to 0.602 from 2021 to 2022 and are preparing Nepal for the LDC graduation.Despite the development gains, the difficult part remains to be achieved: Reducing poverty and inequality among people, climate change, and environmental degradation to successfully meet all the SDGs, generating a high growth rate in the economy for the irreversible graduation from Least Developed Country (LDC) status, building community resilience for disasters risk reduction, among others. You referred to Nepal’s LDC graduation. Nepal is scheduled to graduate from the status of LDCs to a developing nation by 2026. What are the major obstacles that Nepal is facing to achieve its goals? After successfully meeting two of the three criteria—human asset index (HAI) and economic and environmental vulnerability index (EVI)—in the three consecutive triennial reviews, Nepal is scheduled to graduate from LDC in 2026. Nepal has nearly reached the 2024 per capita Gross National Income (GNI) threshold of $1,306, with its per capita GNI of $1,300.Nepal has also been steadily improving across various development indicators. By 2022, it surpassed the LDC average in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development’s (UNCTAD) Productive Capacity Index (PCI), with a score of 40 compared to the LDC average of 31. Nepal has significantly narrowed the gap with the Other Developing Countries (ODC) average, achieving a Human Capital Index of 41 against the ODC average of 44. This impending graduation not only signifies Nepal's progress but also signals to investors the market readiness. The country can further benefit by tapping into its human capital and success stories.Amid these successes, Nepal grapples with a myriad of challenges typical of developing countries. There are significant gaps in critical infrastructures such as energy, transport, and digital technology as well as institutional weaknesses. The country performs weakly in manufacturing with its declining share in the GDP, indicative of an unachieved structural transformation of the economy. These gaps impede Nepal from fully capitalising on its international trade opportunities and abundant natural resources, which could position it as an attractive destination for investments in clean and green initiatives. Realising these aspirations will require continued efforts to create an enabling environment, adopt frontier technologies that can harness resources sustainably, and empower women, girls, and marginalised populations. Nepal also made the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) its aspiration. Do you think that Nepal can meet the SDGs target, mobilise the resources, and monitor them? Nepal’s progress on the SDGs so far is a success story. We are halfway through the SDGs timeline and Nepal has surpassed the global average with a remarkable 42 percent of its indicators on track compared to just 15 percent globally. The credit goes to the proactiveness of the Government of Nepal for its early adoption of the SDGs into the 15th plans, budget, and local governments’ medium-term expenditure frameworks. The National Planning Commission (NPC) has taken strident steps to monitor the progress and assess financing needs for the SDGs through voluntary national reviews and implement its vision to accelerate SDGs. Through a strong partnership with NPC, the UN System has been collaborating with multi-stakeholders in a consultative and inclusive manner to prepare the third Voluntary National Review report. The UN has also been collaborating with the government to identify transformative transitions and catalyse progress towards SDGs, aligning with the Secretary General's six transition approach. Despite the success, challenges persist. Around 20 percent of the national SDG indicators lack data. There is a financing gap of around 11 percent of GDP against the $23 billion annual need to meet the SDG from now until 2030. Achieving the SDGs by 2030 addressing these and other development gaps requires strong partnerships and cooperation among government, private sector, media, academia, development and trade partners, and civil society. You highlighted resource gaps as one of the challenges in achieving SDGs? How did you find the Nepal Investment Summit and how did the United Nations office in Kathmandu support it? How does the UN plan to support the country to reduce financing gaps? First, my heartfelt congratulations to the Government of Nepal for successfully organising the Investment Summit. Organising such a mega event ahead of the 2026 LDC Graduation has reinforced the message that Nepal’s market is open and ready for private investment. The amendment of the nine Acts and commitment to further reforms will facilitate flows of national and international private investments. Political parties’ unified stance on economic development has sent a positive message to the international community.As Nepal’s longstanding development and humanitarian partner, the United Nations in Nepal played an important role in providing policy advice and technical assistance in organising the summit. I joined the UNCTAD Secretary-General Rebeca Grynspan to highlight investment opportunities in Nepal and indicate that multilateral development banks, international financing institutions, and development partners should work together to unlock sustainable investment. The UN Country Team in Nepal has identified finance for development as one of its priority areas for the implementation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) through which the UN System channels all its support to the country. As a part of these priority areas, the UN will support the country to reduce its trade deficit, increase trade competitiveness, catalyse sustainable investments, and increase resource allocation efficiency. This, I hope, will contribute to reducing the financing gaps and supporting the country in materialising its aspiration for sustainable development.Will the United Nations encourage development partners to inject more investment in Nepal and if so, how? Yes, the UN encourages Development Partners (DPs) to invest more in Nepal. We advise focusing the investments in catalytic and impactful sectors that help accelerate SDG achievement. Investment from DPs can be in the form of a grant, loan, equity, or guarantee. These financial instruments have their own characteristics and, therefore, procedures for deployment. They can be mixed, which we call ‘blended finance’.Nepal can explore new blended finance approaches that can crowd into the private sector, multiply developmental impact and create opportunities for the public sector to share risks and rewards fairly. This way, public and private finance together help augment private investments, especially in high-risk and low-return areas.Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), Development Financial Institutions (DFIs), Private Development Banks (PDBs), and development cooperation agencies can work even closer with private partners to leverage resources and increase these investments. Similarly, there are UN agencies that can provide technical assistance to facilitate such financial instruments.The United Nations has its development cooperation framework and engages with the member countries through this special instrument. Could you give some details about how it is engaging with Nepal and what are the positive outcomes? The emphasis of the UN Sustainable Development Cooperation Framework (UNSDCF) is really on the four strategic priorities—sustainable economic transformation, inclusive human development, environmental sustainability, and effective governance with federalism and inclusion— ultimately helping Nepal achieve sustainable and inclusive economic transformation that advances the rights and well-being of all citizens and protects the environment.As the UNSDCF aligns closely with Nepal's national development plans and international commitments, it is highly responsive to Nepal’s evolving needs which now includes successful and irreversible LDC graduation in 2026, attainment of the SDGs by 2030 and post-COVID-19 recovery.Born out of the UN Secretary General’s UN Development System Reform, the UNSDCF ensure coherent delivery of activities by all agencies to address Nepal’s national priorities and gaps to leave no one behind with a strengthened focus on inclusion and tackling inequalities via tangible action for people on the ground, especially those furthest behind. The Cooperation Framework also embodies the spirit of partnerships with host governments and with all stakeholders—civil society, academia, parliaments, the private sector, and bilateral partners to leverage strengths and drive transformative change. A recent example is the UN-Government of Nepal partnership on the Joint Recovery Action Plan for the western Nepal earthquake where one of our bilateral partners FCDO has partially funded the plan to meet the needs and build the resilience of the earthquake-affected population in western Nepal. The UN secretary general also visited Nepal last year and raised the issue of the adverse effects of climate change during the COP-28 as well as the plights of Nepali citizens living across the mountainous regions. How is the UN taking this issue further? The UN Secretary-General’s visit to Nepal last year exposed the country’s vulnerability to climate change before the nation, region and the globe. His personal account of the real impact of climate change in the region followed by his plea to the global community to “stop the madness” had a significant mileage for Nepal, particularly for the 2023 UN climate change conference in November to promote the sustainable mountain agenda in the COP negotiation process.For the UN team in Nepal, environmental sustainability, climate and disaster resilience is one of the strategic priorities. This means we are supporting the government and communities to strengthen the participation of women, socially excluded, and disadvantaged groups in the decision-making process on climate adaptation, mitigation, and disaster risk reduction. This means we are working with all three tiers of government for effective preparedness and response. As more women and marginalised groups are impacted by climate change, we are ensuring the most impacted are also the ones benefiting the most from ecosystem services, alternative and sustainable livelihood opportunities, access to affordable and renewable energy, and employment generation. Another important issue that the UN secretary general raised during his visit was Nepal’s protracted peace process. What is your assessment of how it will be resolved? During his visit, the Secretary-General praised the Nepalese-led peace processes that could serve as an example to the world and urged to conclude the only remaining element—transitional justice—through an inclusive, comprehensive, and victim-centric process. Last year, the transitional justice-related amendment bill gained maximum momentum, when the parliament, government, political actors, civil society as well as conflict victims discussed the contents of the bill aiming to finalise it in a manner that complied with Nepal’s international obligation and the Supreme Court ruling of 2015. Despite some delays, there have been efforts to improve the bill in compliance with national and international obligations. The understanding of the key stakeholders in the process has deepened, and we can see conflict victims of all kinds advocating for themselves.We sincerely hope and encourage the government and the parliament to “leave no stone unturned” to ensure that all victims have access to truth, reparation, and justice that they have been seeking for decades that would eventually heal the wounds of the past, foster reconciliation and ensure non-reoccurrence of violations.Consolidating peace has various dimensions. Longstanding barriers and problems such as violence against women, child marriage and caste-based discrimination, to name a few, hinder the exercise of human rights, and everyone is key to sustainability of peace. Likewise, abiding by the national and international obligations that aim to foster the rule of law and promote human rights is another important element of peace.How do you evaluate Nepal’s role in various UN and other platforms like as a chair of LDC nations, and a member of the Human Rights Council? Nepal has been playing a crucial role in the global forums and processes. It showed exemplary leadership at COP28 last year by championing the Mountain agenda and playing a pivotal role in establishing the Loss and Damage Fund. This included a roundtable featuring high-level delegates in COP28, hosted by the Honourable Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal. Likewise, as a chair of the Global Coordination Bureau of LDCs, in March 2023, Nepal led the organisation of a joint side event along with Bangladesh and Lao PDR calling for action from international partners on successfully managing this transition. Nepal has also been defending the interests of LDCs and articulating their priorities in various forums and platforms in the implementation of the Doha Programme of Actions for LDCs. Nepal’s membership in the Human Rights Council and other multilateral bodies is valuable. At this time of geopolitical polarisation, Nepal can play a bridging role between the big powers and blocs. As one of the three Asia-Pacific Countries in the LGBTI core Group, Nepal has displayed its commitment to the protection and promotion of human rights at the UN General Assembly Third Committee (Social, Humanitarian and Cultural Committee). Nepal co-sponsored the resolution on child early and forced marriage for the first time in 2022. In my recent visit to Madhesh Province, child early marriage and forced marriage were highlighted as the major issues that harmed girls and women as well as the society’s overall development. This leadership at the global level demonstrates the commitment of the country to to end all forms of violence and harmful practices and accelerate equality for every woman and girl, in all their diversity. How is the UN going to cope with issues like the dearth of multilateralism and the growing polarisation between major powers across the globe? The world is facing a troubling lack of cooperation among major powers, but the UN stands as the only largest intergovernmental organisation, uniquely positioned to foster dialogue and diplomacy. By promoting international norms and standards outlined in its Charter and other agreements such as SDGs peace and security, climate action, etc., the UN can encourage member states to prioritise peaceful solutions over conflict and other crises. However, addressing these challenges requires collective action from member states. This year, the UN is preparing for the Summit of the Future by bringing world leaders together to forge a new international consensus on how we deliver a better present and safeguard the future by enhancing cooperation on the current confluence of crises: wars, epidemics, climate change, technological disruptions, and addressing gaps in global governance to meet 21st-century challenges. The summit taking place on September 21–22 in New York aims to enhance cooperation on critical challenges and address gaps in global governance, reaffirm existing commitments, including the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Charter, and move towards a reinvigorated multilateral system that is better positioned to positively impact people’s lives.   \nThe budget session of the federal parliament starts Friday without the resolution of the long-standing differences between the ruling and opposition parties over the formation of a parliamentary committee to investigate alleged cooperative fraud charges against Rabi Lamichhane, deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs. While several bills await parliamentary approval, whether the House will function smoothly is still uncertain. The Post’s Binod Ghimire sat down with Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs, to discuss the government’s plan to make the House productive and its effort to get crucial bills endorsed in the upcoming session. He is also a CPN-UML central committee member. Excerpts:The new session is starting without resolving the old deadlock. How will you ensure its smooth functioning?The Nepali Congress should revisit its demand for the formation of a parliamentary committee targeting a particular person. This is not natural. What are the problems facing the cooperative sector as a whole, which types of fraudulent acts have taken place and who is involved in those cases, however, can be studied. We can constitute a parliamentary committee or other types of panels for such study, which can even recommend actions against those involved in fraud. Why should the main opposition shy away from a detailed study of the entire cooperative sector and want to focus on a particular case and a particular person? I am hopeful the Congress being a responsible democratic party will agree on forming a panel with a broader mandate.The prime minister on Saturday said a probe committee can be formed. What kind of committee is he talking about?He is talking about a committee to study the malpractices prevalent in the cooperative sector, to identify the problems, suggest their solutions while also recommending actions against those involved in fraudulent activities. The main intent behind demanding a probe against a particular person is that once a committee is formed, the party [the Congress] will ask for his resignation. It is an ill-intended demand aimed at creating problems. Media have reported problems in several cooperatives. Would it be feasible to form separate probe committees for each incident? We are in continuous informal discussions with the main opposition and there are plans to discuss the matter formally in an all-party meeting to be held very soon.How will the budget get endorsed if Congress continues to obstruct the House in case the probe panel is not formed as per its demand?Why just probe the home minister and the cooperative where he is allegedly involved? Why not investigate the cooperatives where the leaders from the Congress or any other party might also be involved? We are hopeful that the Congress will analyse whether its demand is rational. I cannot believe it will block budget endorsement.Have you identified why the federal parliament has become so unproductive in terms of bill endorsement?The performance of the parliament is not satisfactory. Getting the bills endorsed as quickly as possible has been my priority ever since taking charge of the ministry. Three bills have been endorsed after I became the minister just two months back. Before that, only one bill had gotten through the parliament in more than one year since the present House of Representatives came into being. That was a matter of shame. Despite the UML then being the opposition party, we had raised the issue in the parliament. It is the government’s responsibility to facilitate the deliberations over the bill and their endorsement. As a law, justice and parliamentary affairs minister, it is my major responsibility to make sure the House sessions are fruitful. I am working accordingly.There are 24 bills under consideration in the federal parliament including 23 under the lower house. I am taking initiatives to get them endorsed in the forthcoming session. The amendment bill to the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TJ) Act, school education bill, bill to amend some Nepal Acts, amendment bill to the Banking Office and Punishment Act, among others, are our top priorities.In January your ministry had identified 109 bills that needed to be presented and endorsed. But only two of them have been registered in the parliament. Why?Our ministry has already consented to different ministries to draft 23 bills. The ministry itself is working on eight more. Several of those bills will be registered in the upcoming session.There are complaints that the bill drafting process is not consultative, which is why many of them are controversial. What is obstructing such broad discussions?I agree that the bills drafted after broad discussions are less contentious. The respective ministries should ensure maximum engagement in the drafting process. If the current bills are drafted without proper consultation, there is room to accommodate diverse voices while they are discussed in the House committees. It won’t be possible to take discussions over all the bills to the public. However, some bills that are closely tied to public concerns need to be discussed at the provincial level or even at the local level, if possible. I also have realised the necessity of broader consultation and commit to it in the days to come.Let’s come to an amendment bill on the Transitional Justice Act. What is stopping the bill from being finalised?The Law, Justice and Human Rights Committee of the parliament has resolved most contentious issues after long discussions. We are close to finding meeting points on some disputed issues. We continue to engage in formal and informal discussions among the parties, with a plan to endorse it from the upcoming session. The Congress, when in government, didn’t have any differences over the bill. Rather our party had some concerns, which we are trying to sort out.I don’t think it suits the Congress to change its position after being sent to the opposition. People are closely following the position of the different parties on the bill.Listing murder as a serious violation and reduced sentencing are visibly the most contentious issues on the bill. What is the meeting point on these issues?Our party’s [the UML’s] position is clear. All killings of the disarmed people other than in the clashes are serious violations of human rights. All the parties have a common view over reduced sentencing but there are differences over its modality.We must be mindful that our transitional justice process delivers justice to the victims. The process cannot move ahead amid reservations from the victims. It is meaningless to push ahead with a process that is not acceptable to concerned stakeholders including the international community.The discussions among the parties are largely focused on these issues. From next week, the House committee will resume deliberations.A committee to recommend the names of the office bearers in two transitional justice commissions has been formed amid reservations from different quarters. Will it still recommend the names or wait until the bill is endorsed?Let us not forget that the committee was formed in line with a time-bound Supreme Court verdict. How can we ignore the court’s order? A bill doesn’t get endorsed in the government’s interest. It is a prerogative of the sovereign parliament. Demanding a halt to the formation of the recommendation committee when the court has already given its verdict is not a responsible act.I have come to know that the National Human Rights Commission hasn’t sent its representative to the committee, which is wrong. Being a responsible constitutional body it can’t baulk at implementing the court's order. It should send its representative. If there are concerns, s/he can present them before the committee.The committee has inducted two retired judges as its members which was the demands of the victims and the other stakeholders. Similarly, there has been an agreement that two members of the five-member commissions will be retired judges. We have tried to abide by the victims’ concerns as much as we can. When will the Supreme Court get justices in vacant positions?Three positions are already vacant and the fourth will be vacant in a matter of a month or so. Justices for all four positions will be selected in a week or two.Voices are growing mainly from the Congress to amend the constitution to revisit the electoral system. What is your opinion?There has been no discussion on changing the electoral modality. Yes, there is a growing concern that we should find a way to ensure greater stability. We need to discuss how.Is there any possibility of the UML and Congress coming together to form a government?This is now a closed chapter. The two parties had tried to find out possibilities for a tie-up when the present coalition was not even formed. Now there are no such discussions, formally or informally. \nPeople lost their loved ones and incurred huge losses in fire incidents in various districts in the past weeks. At least 110 houses were gutted in Mahottari last week as fast-spreading fires engulfed an entire settlement. Just before that, several settlements were destroyed in Gulmi, Rupandehi and Arghakhanchi. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Anil Pokhrel, chief executive of the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Authority, for insights on why fire incidents this year have become so common and alarming.Fire incidents have been rising, causing huge losses in various parts of the country. What is the latest update?We’ve experienced an unprecedented number of fire incidents across Nepal. Around two months ago, we had made projections that something like this could happen. We hosted a national dialogue on disaster with experts from the department of hydrology and meteorology, scientists, foresters and representatives from forest users groups. The experts said this year’s outlook doesn’t look good from the perspectives of fire incidents, mainly because we didn’t get sufficient rainfall this winter. We received only one fifth or 20 percent of average. So, we had sensed the alarming situation. Along with that, we also witnessed soaring temperatures. Average temperatures have risen in hill areas as well. At the emergency meeting on Friday, we briefed top authorities about the likely scenarios due to soaring temperatures and low rainfall. This time, we also witnessed heavy winds that helped spread the fire.Are there other factors too that have made fires this year so disastrous?Inadequate rainfall, increased temperatures and wind gusts are immediate factors. There are two other factors: No fire incidents of this intensity in the past two years and only 1,528 incidents in 2022 and 3,194 in 2023. In 2021, at least 6,537 fire incidents took place, whereas there were only 1,211 incidents in 2020. When you have below average forest fire incidents in the preceding years, there is an accumulation of forest litter. While the litter piled up on the forest floor this time, there was not enough rainfall to dampen it. Rising temperatures and wind gusts added fuel, helping fires spread faster. Thus, the wildfires became more disastrous this time. Nine people have already lost their lives since Nepali New Year (April 13). The death toll of the two weeks is concerning. Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane convened an emergency meeting on Friday where secretaries of the ministries concerned and security chiefs, among other senior officials, joined the discussions. We presented this scenario there and drew their attention to the fact that we still have another two months of dry season until the pre-monsoon rainfall. The next two months are going to be challenging. Besides that, there is an increasing trend of stubble burning mainly because youths aren’t available in villages to work in the fields. Due to acute shortage of labour and high cost of clearing fields, people are resorting to burning stubbles, weeds and other remains. There is a perception among the farmers that the ashes work as manure. So, we need massive awareness and training to tackle the situation. People need to be educated about the wider effects of such acts in society. We have also seen unprecedented levels of damage to houses and settlements. When large swathes of forests are burnt, a long-developed ecosystem is destroyed. There are also indirect impacts on human health. In 2019, an estimated 42,100 deaths were attributed to air pollution in Nepal. Besides, the movement of bad quality air from our southern neighbour India is also causing problems. So, this is also a regional problem. You said the ministry convened several meetings in and outside Kathmandu, held discussions among stakeholders and authorities concerned were also alerted. But why have our agencies failed to stop and contain fire incidents?Yes, we have convened a series of dialogues on fire incidents. We also organised events for specific municipalities. The most recent one was in Madhesh Province, where chief district officers of all eight districts in the province, among other officials, were invited. Home minister chaired the meeting. We are taking such initiatives to expedite preparatory measures.In fact, our forest coverage increased drastically in the past three decades. Globally, Nepal is taken as a success story in growing forests. This is positive but it also increases the risk of fires. We don’t have adequate human resources, training and equipment to protect these forests from fire. Also, the increasing trend of youths leaving the country and people migrating from the villages has exacerbated the situation. Women and the elderly who are left behind are more vulnerable to fire incidents. Homesteads of deserted houses are covered by bushes. We also find totally empty settlements. There is no gap between forests and settlements. These factors are causing disastrous fires.What is the government doing to tackle the problem in view of this changed context?We have introduced some new technologies based on our ground reality. Usually, we find people in our context go to the fire incident sites without any equipment and gear. There is also a lack of trained people across the country. So, we are focusing on training members of community forest groups. We now prioritise certain areas identified as hotspots. We are giving three types of training. We are training local volunteers who are working with palikas [local units] and other agencies at the local levels. We give orientation on how to put out fires in grasslands and bushes and how to do it when it spreads as crown fire. When trees start to burn people shouldn’t go there. Only fire brigades are useful in such cases. But fire trucks can’t go to difficult terrains. So, we have introduced portable fire pumps. We learned this from Japan’s national disaster management authority. These pumps are handheld. People can carry them on their own and use them in difficult terrains as well.Can they effectively put out big fires?They are quite effective. For that, you need a pond, a well or other source of water. Since last year, we have already used these water pumps in over 120 places and found them quite effective in dousing fires. At Friday’s meeting we decided to invest more in such pumps. I suggested every ward of local units need to have at least one such portable fire pump. They can’t replace fire trucks but are quite useful for us given our geographical features and even for narrow streets of a city like Kathmandu. You need Rs10 million to buy a fire truck, whereas around 20 portable pumps can be bought for the same amount. The cost ranges from Rs300,000 to around Rs1 million. So each ward can easily afford it. They can pump water from a distant pond or river in hill areas and it can be carried along with water tanks in narrow streets in towns. Maintaining a fire truck and fire brigade is difficult as we need drivers, firemen and their assistants. So, palikas may not be able to afford that. Therefore, we are planning to promote portable fire pumps.In addition, we are designing a training curriculum mainly targeting three sections of people—volunteers of community forest users groups, security agencies including the forest guards and the disaster responders and district level officials who should understand its nuances. We are also running campaigns through various types of awareness materials. In the meantime, we have added search and rescue equipment mainly for security agencies and other personnel deployed in the tasks. Likewise, we have started adopting advanced systems such as helicopters to put out forest fires. First time, we doused forest fires from helicopters through the ‘bambi bucket operations’ in Pathibhara of Taplejung and then in Shivapuri and Tanahu as well.Are palikas and other local agencies effective in tackling these cases?We have found local community forest groups quite active in tackling fire incidents. They may not be able to handle big fires. So they coordinate and work with security agencies. Our legal system has given palikas the lead in such cases. So, our role is to equip the local governments. We handed over 100 portable fire pumps to them while around 14 have been sent to district emergency operation centres. Our focus is on equipping local governments. Of them, some do really well. Some others have average performance while yet others do really poorly. We need to form a group of volunteers in each local unit, train them and equip them with gears. What about the role of provinces? Are they working effectively in disaster management?Provinces are critical especially for undertaking risk assessments and determining which palikas have higher, moderate and lower levels of risks. They can help enhance the capacity of local governments and in reconstruction as well. Some provincial authorities are working as per that spirit, such as in Koshi and Bagmati. Karnali has introduced a new concept of insurance for humans as well as property loss.In recent years, we have seen a rapid increase in the number of big business complexes in Kathmandu and other cities. But they don’t seem prepared to tackle fire incidents or other disasters. How do you see this trend?This is a serious issue. We discussed this matter in Friday’s emergency meeting as well. We need to devise a system to assess risk in such buildings. These buildings need to be inspected and checked for whether there is a fire fighting system in place, adequate exits and evacuation systems. We will work on these issues with local governments as it falls under their jurisdiction. \nWe are indeed obliged, like Deepak Thapa [“In defence of alternative narratives”, The Kathmandu Post, October 28, 2021] to Rajan Khatiwada, Simon Cubelic and Alex Michaels from the Heidelberg University for translating the 1854 Muluki Ain of Jung Bahadur and for making it freely available online, including for the “huge mass (of Nepalis) unaware of our history”. It is misleading, though, to assert that the landmark legal code gives ''nearly single-minded focus on propping up the caste system.\" Muluki Ain rationalised the judicial structure and codified legal principles of a common law throughout the nation that substantiated the status of a sovereign state. By defining the powers inherent in, and assigning definitive responsibilities to, institutions of governance, including that of the monarch and the prime minister, it ensured that specific provisions of law replaced or minimised arbitrary verdicts that were the norm earlier and thereby recognised the concept of the rule of law, a vital component of democratic norms and constitutions. The four-tier caste varna division was linked with the individual's aptitude and profession during the formative, Vedic age of the Sanatana Dharma. It was later given a “sinister twist and linked with the accident of birth”, as stated by Swami Chinmayananda in his commentary on the Gita in The Holy Gita. In the late 14th century, King Jayasthiti Malla of Kathmandu compiled and adopted the thus far informal or unwritten legal and spiritual tenets based on the extant practices (including the caste system) and gave it the name of Nepala Rashtra Shastra. The comprehensive and mammoth Muluki Ain was compiled by a 230-member council constituted by Jung Bahadur after nearly three years of arduous travels and extensive discussion throughout the country. It covered every aspect of life in the country, including ‘farting in someone's face’ as curiously singled out in Thapa’s column, the religious shastras, practices, customs and social traditions of different regions and communities that necessarily included the injustices embedded in the caste system. The document is undoubtedly based on the moral principles of the shastras and extant traditions including the caste system, but it also recognises the need for timely reforms and thus stipulates that conflicting verdicts appear (in the past) for similar cases or offences: ‘henceforth, on breach of law the punishment to all people shall be uniform’ depending on the caste of the offender.Finally, one must remember that Muluki Ain, as its title clarifies, is a legal code and not a paper on socio-cultural-religious reforms. Nevertheless, it expresses its intent of purpose for such reforms sporadically.Sagar SJB Rana, Lalitpur \nOur attention has been drawn to a news report published by The Kathmandu Post regarding our operations in Helambu (‘Helambu administration says Melamchi project didn’t pay promised tax’, March 31).Quoting the rural municipality, the paper writes, ‘Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, the Chinese contractor company of the project, has not paid for the resources—slates, stones, soils and other riverbed materials—used while constructing Ambathan dam and other infrastructures in Helambu Rural Municipality Ward No 1.’ Our main objection goes with this sentence of the news. Sinohydro began completing the uncompleted infrastructures of the Melamchi Water Supply Project after making a formal agreement with the concerned agencies of the Government of Nepal. We have signed the terms and conditions and we assure you that we abide by the clauses mentioned in the agreement. As a construction company, we managed construction materials from different legal sources. Some materials were imported from foreign countries while some of them were purchased locally and also some of them is recycling of discarded bulk rock and soil from the tunnel or dam excavation period. As mentioned in the news, the company used slates, stones, soil and other riverbed materials in the infrastructure, but all these materials were used under construction for three major purposes. The first one is aggregate used for mixing concrete and backfill work which were legally bought from local vendors and suppliers with fully paid taxes. The second one is backfill stone used for gabion wall work. The last one is the hard stone used for laying weir lining. The latter two were recycled excavated mucking rock heaped up in the construction field rather than the river bed materials. For the aggregate, the company has paid all the vendors and suppliers for the materials they supplied and we believe that all of the vendors and suppliers are satisfied with the company. The entire bill, invoices, payment receipts, dispatches and all other documents of transactions and payments concerning the local and the foreign vendors and suppliers are transparent, and are kept safely in the company’s office. The news report is misleading, and should be amended.Sinohydro Corporation Ltd, via email \nWe understand that many Nepalis look for an opportunity to work in Japan, and their expectations are very high, as Japan opened up its labour market for Nepalis as specified skilled workers (SSW) and a direct flight between Nepal and Japan was opened in 2019. Japan desperately needs foreign workers due to the shortage of a domestic labour force. Therefore, it is in the interest of both countries to make sure that Nepali people who passed the examination for SSW can find a job smoothly and travel to Japan without excessive financial burden. However, in a recent article, there seem to be some crucial misunderstandings and confusions about the Memorandum of Cooperation Japan and Nepal concluded in 2019, which we fear may complicate the smooth implementation of our agreement (‘Third party involvement in Japan job programme contradicts agreement’, December 21, 2020). The embassy would like to clarify the following.The article mentions, ‘The agreement says that recruitment is to be carried out under a government-to-government (G2G) modality’. This is not true. The Memorandum does not provide any government-to-government procedure for sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal. The contract of employment will be signed by the Nepali workers and their employers in Japan. The Government of Japan doesn’t interfere in the private labour market. On the other hand, the Government of Nepal wants to put the implementation of the employment process under its control by issuing permission to Nepali workers wishing to work in Japan. It rather should be called ‘government-to-business modality (G2B)’. Maybe this misunderstanding derives from the fact that Nepal has concluded migrant worker agreements with other countries only under the G2G modality and has not used the G2B modality.Since last October, 207 Nepalis passed the Japanese language test for care workers and 234 Nepalis passed the technical test for care workers. Unfortunately, none of them have been able to find a job so far. It is desirable they make their own effort to find a job in the Japanese labour market. The article further mentions, ‘both countries had strictly ruled out the role of any third party agencies while hiring and supplying workers to Japan’. This is also untrue. The MOC does not have any paragraph stating to exclude the operation of private recruiting agencies. Paragraph 4 of the Memorandum states that Japan and Nepal can consult on issues related to corrective measures for improper accepting organisations in Japan, or organisations engaging in support for foreign human resources with the status of residence of specified skilled workers, and for the improper activities of the concerned organisations in Nepal. Therefore, the participation of private organisations in the process of sending and accepting SSW to Japan from Nepal is not prohibited. The intermediary agencies to provide Nepali workers with jobs should be registered in Japan in accordance with Japanese laws.The article referred to the possibility that Nepali workers who wish to work in Japan may have to pay for airfare, insurance and medical examination. Since Japan is a free economy country, the Government of Japan can’t enforce Japanese companies to pay these costs for Nepali workers. In practice, most Japanese companies cover these costs in employment contracts, but it depends on the individual contract.The article further stated that ‘Nepal is the only South Asian country from where Japan would be hiring workers for 14 industrial sectors’. Actually, Japan also signed similar agreements with Pakistan, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka after Nepal.We hope that this information is helpful for Nepali people to better understand the agreement between the two countries and that those who passed the examination will be able to find a job and go to Japan as soon as possible.The Embassy of Japan in Nepal \nI am very grateful to Deepak Thapa for raising concerns about the fate of Nepali studies in Euro-America, and for his kind words about my own work over the years (‘Nepali language at SOAS’, November 25). I would like to add that much of what we achieved at SOAS University of London would not have been possible without the contribution of my colleague Krishna Pradhan. Pradhan taught Nepali at SOAS for 15 years until his own early retirement in 2019, and was greatly admired by the many students who learned so much from him. His presence at SOAS also enabled me to develop courses in Nepali literature, history and culture alongside the essential language courses. Sadly, none of this will be available to future generations of students in the UK.Michael Hutt,Emeritus Professor of Nepali and Himalayan Studies,SOAS, University of London \nWhile feminine issues are addressed every now and then, not everything is taken seriously, and the unspoken issues go unnoticed. Here, I’m not only addressing the horrendous issue of Chhaupadi itself but also speaking of those women and girls who fall prey to this absurd menstrual practice.Ever thought what travelling back in time would feel like? Many in Nepal do not have to imagine, as such old and evil practises continue to occur in the 21st century!Chhaupadi is a flawed tradition connected to the taboo surrounding menstruation that prohibits Hindu menstruators from participating in normal family activities while on their period, as they are considered impure. Although it is said to be practised in the rural part of the country, it does exist in urban areas, too. Going back to its roots, we could perhaps rationalise that women were asked to stay cautious when menstruating because humans were closely surrounded by wildlife. The stench of blood during their period may have made them more vulnerable to attacks from these animals. But even this absurd line of thought doesn't make much sense anymore. The practise was made illegal in 2005, but cases related to it were reported as recent as 2019. News headlines vouched for fatalities on this account. But why are there such trivial punishments for such an offence? Shouldn’t the punishments be rethought to strongly discourage Chhaupadi altogether?Moreover, the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg. The more you look into it, there are bound to be cases that have gone unreported because nothing immediately tragic occurred. This letter is a call for all of us to come together to fight this social plague. While the legal implications of such an offence are ambiguous, let's collectively decide that the societal implications of it will be grave. Let's refuse to accept such atrocities for our mothers, sisters and, above all, ourselves.Gauri Tandon, via email \n\nBe elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings.
