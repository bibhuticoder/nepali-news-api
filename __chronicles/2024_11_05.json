Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \nThe construction of a concrete bridge over the Babai river near Ghuinyabari in Kalimati Rural Municipality-7 has faced significant delays, with only 70 percent of the work completed after seven years. The project, initially contracted to be completed within three years, has suffered due to various issues, including a lack of initial effort from the contractor.The contract for the bridge was signed in 2017, with a three-year completion target. However, despite multiple deadline extensions, only one out of the three spans has been completed to date. The water level in the Babai river remains high during monsoon seasons, further hindering progress, and it appears unlikely that the bridge will be finished this year.The federal government allocated a budget of Rs450 million for the project in 2017, dedicating Rs160 million to construct the bridge near Ghuinyabari. The contract was awarded to Rasuwa Elite JV by the Mid and Far-Western Sector No. 3 Nepalgunj office, with construction starting in June 2017. The 180-metre-long bridge, comprising five pillars, was planned for completion by 2020.Despite the contractor’s commitment to completing the project within three years, work has now extended to seven years, with only 70 percent completed due to delays during the rainy season. Local resident Karna Bahadur Rana reported that initial contractors did little to advance the work. Although recent contractors have made some progress, it remains insufficient to meet the project’s objectives.Mitra Lal Rijal, chair of ward 7 in Kalimati Rural Municipality, attributed the delays to initial inactivity by the contractor. He explained that the project was postponed for nearly three years due to contractor negligence, with work resuming last year under pressure from various stakeholders. However, the contractor has yet to accelerate the project to completion.In addition to the bridge, the government aims to connect the Salyan Khalanga-Kalimati-Damdawali-Ghuinyabari-Chapargauri-Nepalgunj road. However, delays in the bridge project have hindered progress, and until the road is fully connected, the bridge will not fulfil its intended purpose.Kalimati Rural Municipality Chair Dan Bahadur Khatri added that, due to unresolved issues in the Nikunj area, approximately 15 km of road construction remains. Although Rs400 million was allocated for road construction in this area, progress was stalled by environmental restrictions. Consequently, the authorities plan to upgrade the road section in Kalimati.Rasuwa Elite JV supervisor Mahesh Gautam said that initial delays were caused by challenges in excavating for pillars, as large underground rocks obstructed foundation work. \nThe 220kV Chilime-Trishuli transmission line project has been completed after seven years of construction. This crucial development in the energy sector is expected to open the doors to electricity trade with China. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line links two locations: Chilime, a small village close to the Chinese border in the north of Kathmandu in Rasuwa district, and Trishuli, a smaller town in Nuwakot district. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, this transmission line project is extremely important for Nepal because it will benefit electricity producers and facilitate power trading with the northern neighbour, China.Kulman Ghising, managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said in a statement issued on Monday, \"The Chilime-Kerung international transmission line will be built for electricity trade with China, the neighbouring country to the north. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line will serve as a link to China.”During the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to China in September last year, the two sides signed an agreement to develop the Nepal section of the proposed 220kV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border transmission line with a Chinese grant.“The two sides will launch the construction of the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV cross-border power transmission line at an early date,” according to the joint statement issued during the visit.The two sides agreed to build the first transmission line connecting the two neighbours. Currently, without grid connectivity with China, Nepal relies solely on India for importing electricity during the dry season and exports its surplus power during the wet season.Around a dozen cross-border transmission lines are already in operation, including one with 400kV capacity to India, while four other 400kV cross-border grids extending southwards are in the pipeline.According to the NEA officials, the Nepal section is 16 km from the China border to the Chilime hub, while the Chinese will need to construct around 80 km from its side to the border.This project is designed to evacuate electricity generated from the Trishuli River basin, marking a significant milestone in Nepal's energy infrastructure.This is the key power evacuation project that would benefit the projects, including the 216MW Upper Trishuli-1, 60MW Upper Trishuli 3A, and the 36MW Upper Trishuli 3B hydroelectric projects. The transmission line would also evacuate power from the 14.6MW Upper Sanjen, 42.5MW Sanjen, 111MW Rasuwagadhi, 14.3MW Upper Mailung, and 5MW Upper Mailung A hydroelectric projects.The 28 km Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double circuit electricity transmission line has 76 pylons. “The facility would evacuate power from the 111MW Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project and 42.5MW Sanjen Hydropower Project, both built under the authority's subsidiary company, Chilime Jalvidyut,” said Ghising, adding that the Rasuwagadhi and Sanjen projects have been completed and are in the power generation stage.“This transmission line will also help many other hydropower projects under construction in the area.”\"Erecting a pylon was challenging in many areas. The mountainous terrain meant many places did not have roads, so people or mules had to carry conduction materials like stones, sand, water and pylon parts. Additionally, floods and landslides, forest clearance, local obstacles and Covid-19 also created hurdles,” said Ghising. According to the NEA, 33 pylons had to be constructed in places without access roads.“Despite all odds, we have completed the project through our continuous efforts,” said Ghising.Tharka Bahadur Thapa, chief of the grid operation department of the NEA, said the project built more than 20 kilometres of access roads.He said that nine pylons were constructed by transporting construction materials and equipment by mules and people, while two were built by transporting construction materials by helicopter. In most mountain areas, drones were used to connect the overhead line cables from one pylon to another. The 65 million euro (approximately Rs9.49 billion as per Monday’s exchange rate) project was jointly financed by the German government through its Development Bank KfW (grant of 14 million euro), European Investment Bank (loan of 25 million euro), the European Union under its Asia Investment Facility (2.25 million euro) and the rest by Nepal government.In October 2017, Chinese firm Pinggao Group of Companies was awarded the contract to build the transmission line and substation. The transmission line project includes the construction of the 220/132 kV Trishuli 3B hub substation, the 220/132 kV Chilime substation, and the Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double-circuit transmission line.The transmission line has been constructed at elevations ranging from 680 to 2,600 metres above sea level.  \nPolice detained seven protestors after the clash with Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) cadres in Pokhara on Tuesday afternoon.Tensions rose in Pokhara as a protest in support of RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, currently under police custody for investigation on charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime, led to a confrontation with the police.The police used tear gas when protesters attempted to breach a restricted area. In the ensuing clash, seven protestors were detained, according to police sources.RSP activists began their protest ahead of Lamichhane’s scheduled court appearance for an extension of his custody at Kaski District Court. The clash occurred when the activists, who were heading towards Y Chowk, were intercepted by the police at Ratna Chowk.On Tuesday, Lamichhane was brought before the Kaski District Court for a remand extension before Judge Chandrakanta Paudel. Former Deputy Inspector General and Gorkha Media Network co-director Chhabilal Joshi was also presented.Joshi has been held since September 22, while Lamichhane was detained on October 18 from the RSP central office and transferred to Kaski. The court initially granted six days of custody, later extended by seven more days. Due to the Tihar holiday, Lamichhane appeared before the court on Tuesday after his remand expired on October 30.In connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case, suspects Leela Pachhai and Ram Bahadur Khanal also faced remand extension requests. Authorities discovered an unauthorised transfer of Rs 30 million from the cooperative to Pachhai’s account.Khanal, 48, a Tanahun native and shareholder in the Gorkha Group of Companies Limited, was detained by a Central Investigation Bureau team on October 25 in Kathmandu. He also owns Nature Herbs International.The police are preparing to take former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane to Butwal for an investigation into allegations of cooperative fraud and organised crime. \nLight to moderate rainfall that occurred briefly on Sunday and again on Monday brought a chill to the Kathmandu Valley and several parts of the country. The Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said light to moderate rainfall is expected on Tuesday as well in most of the hilly and mountainous regions.“Light to moderate rainfall has occurred in hilly and mountainous areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki Provinces and some places of Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces have also witnessed rainfall on Monday,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Some places of Tarai region of Lumbini Province also witnessed rainfall. Temperature will decline further in the coming days as rainfall will bring chilly weather.”The Met Office attributes the rainfall and weather disturbances to westerly winds, local weather systems and effects of low pressure areas formed around West Bengal of India. There are chances of light snowfall in a few places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country on Sunday night, according to the Met Office. Hilly areas of the country will witness general to partly cloudy conditions and the rest of the places will witness partial cloudy conditions.“We will see sunlight on Wednesday,” said Manandhar. “Weather will improve Wednesday onwards.”According to met Office, Kathmandu Valley recorded 6.1 mm rainfall in 4 hours on Monday. Minimum temperature of the Valley recorded 16.2 degree Celsius. Many people including office goers were soaked and those returning to Kathmandu Valley and in other destinations across the country after celebrating Tihar were affected due to disturbances in domestic flights. Farmers preparing to harvest rice, millet and other crops have also been affected due to rain.Meanwhile the rainfall has helped reduce air pollution in many places including the capital city, which had worsened of late.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that Nepal's maximum temperature is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius. \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nThe global order is crumbling rapidly. It appears nowhere near the Schumpeterian idea of creative destruction; Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, therefore, barely posits the optimism of legendary phoenix-like revival. The global playground of powers is now without a custodian or a referee to stop the ratchet. It is almost axiomatic that the global order is critical to global governance, which is inevitable for global peace and prosperity. In this increasingly interconnected world, societal and national orders are also largely contingent on the global order and the outcome of the geopolitics of the governance, whether good or bad.The imperative of global governance was desperately realised in the 1940s after the two devastating Great Wars. As a result, essentially, the United Nations (UN), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, now WTO) and similar other multilateral institutions were established. So far, hundreds of international treaties, conventions and covenants have been drafted and implemented or enforced, at least in theory. However, due to the rapidly widening gap between expectation and (in)effectiveness (or helplessness?), these institutions and instruments, mainly the UN and its agencies, are now being questioned regarding the rationale of their very existence.Without a refereeThe end of the Russia-Ukraine war is nowhere on the horizon. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be consolidating his legitimacy through forums like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Economic sanctions on Russia by Western countries have had little impact due to the unhindered revenue flow from oil and gas supplied to Europe and Asia. The Gaza crisis is spreading to the entire Arab world and, perhaps, beyond. The foreign policy of the United States on Gaza and Israel seems pressed between its interest in protecting the Israeli state and saving its democratic credentials by stopping inhuman excesses at the Israeli war targets. Digital, communication and transportation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet and drones, are being used more for destructive purposes, such as starting wars, rather than serve humanity. Trade wars have intensified. The global debt balloon has spiralled out of control, and so has the climate crisis. So, apprehensions abound that we may be on the verge of World War III.Personalities like UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres often cry foul from the fringes, but there are no takers of it. The UN is unable to safeguard its agency, UNWRA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), against the formal Israeli allegations of colluding with the groups that Israel has labelled as 'terrorists'. They are even incapable of admonishing the countries that are blatantly engaged in arms sales and doing nothing tangible to mitigate the potential threat of nuclear war. The leaders of powerful nations on the frontline continue to disregard international laws, rules or norms, sine qua non for maintaining global order and, thereby, ensuring fair global governance.Of course, there is a broader age-old unanswered question surrounding the very design of these institutions, choice of location for their headquarters, personnel selection processes, modus operandi and funding mechanisms. All these aspects were ab initio at the control and mercy of the same group of powerful nations that often choose to flout the so-called international rules and norms. The current international governance mayhem is akin to a game without a referee capable of flagging a foul to powerful global players who are quarrelling rather than respecting the game of rules.Throb of repolarisationThe debate over the shift of the global power poles and the emergence of multipolarity is gaining currency. However, the throb and thong of creating, recognising and sustaining multiple such poles have fiercely gripped the world. The emerging potential poles are keen to build new alliances, while the existing ones exert all efforts not to lose their grip. This has resulted in multifaceted tit-for-tat actions and reactions among the countries through diplomatic rows, strategic bans and fresh trade barriers.Within days after Putin appeared in a triumphant mood regarding his ability to invite leaders from 36 countries for the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia on 22-24 October, the US government on October 30 imposed ‘sanctions on nearly four hundred entities and individuals for enabling Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.’ This action targets multiple sectors essential to Russia’s war effort.’ This includes the ‘entities and individuals’ from China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Türkiye, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who continue to sell ‘important dual-use goods to Russia, including critical components that the country relies on for its weapons systems to wage war against Ukraine.’Extracting allegianceThis United States’ move is critical since it involves putative allies and big trade partners like India, Switzerland and the UAE. India is part of ‘the Quad’, the group of four countries (the other three being Australia, Japan and Australia) created out of large ‘democracies’ in the Indo-Pacific region. They had a summit in the last week of September in Washington, DC. The US sanction to 19 Indian entities and two Indian nationals comes at a time when its diplomatic row with Canada, one of the closest US allies, is at its height. Its trade deficit with Russia was $57.14 billion last year against the export of only $4.26 billion. India is among the countries which continued to import Russian oil during the Western sanctions. Nepal is one of the beneficiaries of stable oil prices that are maintained due to this supply. The American move appears to extract unconditional allegiance from India, moving away from Russian engagement. The tug-of-war of creating or breaking alliances is poised to only be nastier in the future.The most alarming and dangerous trait is that the war, financing billions from these rich countries, has been forthcoming and instant. However, humanitarian and development assistance to the developing world has been asymptotic to zero for decades. What’s more, the governments and parliaments of these countries are approving these finances to the parties of their interest at the cost of astronomical debt burden to their treasuries. The IMF estimates that the global public debt will exceed $100 trillion, or about 93 percent of the global gross domestic product, by the end of this year. Only two countries, the US and China, account for 50 percent of it—$36 trillion and 16 trillion, respectively. There is no mechanism to tame them. \nAccording to the United Nations 2024 is “the biggest election year in human history” with half of the world’s population—some 3.7 billion people in 72 countries—able to vote. Yet some elections are more consequential than others which is why the world is watching as the United States goes to the polls.The US is the world’s largest economy, and the biggest military power. But it also the lynchpin of many international strategic alliances, the economic and financial system and many of the world’s liberal institutions.These elections are a pivotal moment in US history which could have massive implications for how the country is governed and for the future of the post-war order that Washington has helped build.Unlike any election since 1945 the basic tenets of US relations with the rest of the world are in contention. The choice is between Donald Trump’s Republican party potentially offering a complete break from the US’s role in the international community, compared to Kamala Harris’s more international agenda under the Democrats. Under Harris, the US is likely to continue to play a significant role in Nato, for instance.Tariffs on ChinaThe most conspicuous assault on the US’s foreign policy tradition is Trump’s plans to impose a universal tariff of 20 percent on all foreign imports. Tariffs on China could be much higher with threats from Trump of 60-200 percent. As well as being inflationary and damaging to the American economy such moves are likely to result in retaliation, trade wars and dislocation with the world economy. By limiting access to the world’s largest national market, they would also hamper global efforts to transition to a zero-carbon economy.Such matters are of little concern to Trump however, who plans to repeat his withdrawal of Washington from the Paris agreement on climate change, to repeal the environmental protection measures implemented by Joe Biden, and to authorise the unrestricted exploitation of US oil and gas deposits through deregulated fracking. Trump’s plans would add tonnes of extra carbon to the atmosphere if executed and would be likely to significantly undermine global work on climate change.Also in contention in the 2024 election is the US commitment to defend its friends and allies from hostile states. As a member of Nato the US is bound to come to the aid of the other members under article 5, if another country attacks them, and it also has similar treaties with Japan and South Korea. The Biden administration led Nato in supporting Ukraine with military and financial aid to prevent its total subjugation to Russian occupation.By contrast Trump has indicated that he would end this support and pressure Kyiv to accept peace on Moscow’s terms. Rather than seeing a network of alliances as the basis of strength and influence, Trump sees these as a source of risk and a burden.Defending friendsMany former officials, such as former national security advisor John Bolton, suspect that Trump would seek to leave Nato in a second term or weaken its effectiveness through tepid support. In Asia, Trump’s recent comments that “Taiwan should pay us for defence. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company” suggest a weakening of US commitment to the island.For many observers these elections also matter because the US’s ability to conduct a free, fair and undisputed election and the peaceful transfer of power is in question. From his first involvement in the Republican party primary process in 2016 Trump has never accepted the results of an election that he lost.What is more remarkable is that he has convinced a majority of Republican voters to side with him in asserting that the 2020 election was stolen, only a third believe the election was legitimate. When faith in the electoral process is so undermined it is difficult to see how the US can come together to be governed after the election.For the Trump camp, however, there is a ready answer for this question. If elected, Project 2025, a document of policies prepared by a right-leaning think tank, suggests that his administration would replace the top tier of Washington’s bureaucracy with 50,000 officials who pledge loyalty to him over the constitution. It also suggests that a Trump administration would disband a myriad of federal agencies such as the departments of justice, energy, and education as well as the FBI and Federal Reserve and to use his newly claimed executive authority to impose his policy agenda.Such measures are designed to enable Trump to introduce a raft of policies that many regard as authoritarian, such as the deportation of millions of “illegal aliens”, using the National Guard and army, if necessary.The US experiment with democracy has fascinated and inspired the world since its inception in 1776. Never before, however, has it seemed in such jeopardy. The US is deeply divided on many fundamental questions, from taxation, immigration, abortion, trade, energy and environmental policy, and its role in the world.For the first time these divisions seem more important to many electors than respect for their democratic institutions and traditions. More fundamentally, many US citizens seem unable to accept the result of the democratic process and the subsequent legitimacy of the winner. Who wins the election and how the US is governed as a result, matters more now, to more people, than ever.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s secretariat has cancelled all the meetings scheduled for Tuesday citing the poor health of the head of the government.According to the secretariat, the Prime Minister has been experiencing a mild fever since Monday and is, currently, resting at his official residence in Baluwatar.“He developed a fever yesterday,” a secretariat member said. “It is mild at the moment, and he is resting; all of today’s meetings have been called off.” \nFlooding is one of the most common natural disasters around the world as evidenced by the severe flooding that has impacted several countries this year alone.According to World Bank data from 2020, around 1.47 billion people or about 19% of the global population. face significant risks of severe flooding from rivers, heavy rainfall, or coastal erosion, with 89% of those at risk residing in low- to middle-income countries.The majority of those vulnerable to flooding—about 1.36 billion people—live in South and East Asia, with 329 million in China and 225 million in India, making up more than one-third of the world’s flood-prone population.In 2024, nine out of the top 10 countries most at risk of river flooding are in Asia, particularly in the southern and eastern regions of the continent. Southeast Asia, with its low-lying terrain, frequent tropical storms, heavy rains, long monsoon seasons, and underdeveloped flood protection infrastructure, is especially prone to frequent and severe flooding.Climate change is also impacting the frequency and intensity of these events, with an estimated 30% increase in flood-affected populations if global temperatures rise by 2°C.According to Statista’s March 2024 survey on flood risk, based on the approximate number of people affected by annual floods, the risk index ranges from 0 to 10 (higher scores indicate higher risk). The countries with the highest flood risk are Vietnam, Egypt and Bangladesh (risk index 9.9); Thailand (9.8); Iraq (9.6); Pakistan (9.5); China (9.3); India (9.2); Myanmar (8.8); and Cambodia (8.7).Since mid-2024, Thailand has faced intense flooding due to the ongoing rainy season, especially in the northern region, with some parts of the south also affected. Total rainfall from January to August was 5% above the average for this period and the amount of rainfall from August to October is expected to exceed the average, with the central region (including Bangkok) projected to receive 800-900 mm, compared to the normal average of 782 mm, with the northern and central regions experiencing the most severe flooding as the lower northern region serves as a channel directing rainfall toward the sea.The economic impacts are significant, with flooding expected to affect 8.6 million rai (1.38 million hectares) of agricultural land this year, causing property and asset damage of 3.1 billion baht and agricultural production losses worth 43.4 billion baht. The total economic impact could reach 46.5 billion baht, reducing annual GDP by 0.27%.-In Association with ANN \nBoeing’s US West Coast factory workers accepted a new contract offer on Monday, ending a bitter seven-week strike that halted most jet production and deepened a financial crisis at the troubled planemaker.The union said members voted 59% in favour of the new contract, which includes a 38% pay rise spread over four years, easing pressure on new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg after two previous offers were voted down in recent weeks.“This is a victory. We can hold our heads high,” Jon Holden the union’s lead negotiator, told members after the results were announced. “Now it’s our job to get back to work.”The end of the first strike in 16 years by Boeing’s largest union provides welcome relief for a company that has lurched from one setback to the next since a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX plane in mid-air in January.In a message to Boeing employees after the vote, Ortberg said he was pleased the union had ratified a deal.“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” he said. “There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”Around 33,000 machinists who work on the best-selling 737 MAX jet, as well as the 767 and 777 widebodies, have been on strike since September 13, demanding a 40% wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension they lost a decade ago for a 401(k) retirement plan.“I’m ready to get back to work,” said David Lemon, a worker in equipment calibration certification in Seattle who voted in favour of the contract.He calculated that the pay hike and a 4% bonus - the guaranteed minimum annual payout to the reinstated incentive plan - amounted to the 40% increase they’d gone after. “We got there,” he said.The old pension will not be restored, but workers will receive a bump to company matching contributions for their 401(k) plans.Boeing also promised to build the next aeroplane in the Seattle area. “They’ve never given us a commitment” to a new aeroplane before launch, Holden said.President Joe Biden and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, who facilitated the contract talks, congratulated workers and the company on the outcome. “We’ve shown that collective bargaining works,” Biden said.Boeing said Su was instrumental in moving both sides toward reaching a ratified deal.Biden has been particularly supportive of unions as president, and the union vote comes the day before Americans go to national polls to pick his successor.SLOW RAMP UPBoeing will now take weeks to ramp up plane production and boost cash flow, with 737 MAX output expected to languish in the single digits per month for some time, according to two people briefed on the matter, far short of the 38-a-month targeted before the strike.Workers can start returning to building planes from Wednesday, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said, although Boeing has warned that some people will have to be retrained due to the prolonged period away from the factory floor.The strike was costing Boeing around $100 million a day in lost revenue, analysts said, prompting the planemaker to raise $24 billion from investors last week in a bid to preserve its investment-grade credit rating.Ortberg now needs to reset relations with machinists in the Pacific Northwest who have used the strike to vent anger built up over a decade when wages have lagged inflation and the cost of living in the Seattle area has soared.The union has said its members earned just four 1% wage increases over the last eight years.“I’m demoralised, to say the least,” said 777 worker Thomas Amilowski, who voted against the contract. He said the union leadership, which had backed the offer in the first vote that was resoundingly rejected by nearly 95% of members, had a “defeatist mindset.”Holden noted that 59% approval meant “there were those who definitely were not happy with the vote.” But he added that workers can rebuild the relationship with Boeing leadership.Boeing has said the average annual machinists’ pay at the end of the new four-year contract will be $119,309, up from $75,608 previously.The pay increase may add $1.1 billion to Boeing’s wage bill over the four years, while a $12,000 ratification bonus for each union member could result in another $396 million in outflows, according to analysts at Jefferies.More than 26,000 union members voted, putting turnout near 80%. \nAnother 2,500 soldiers arrived in the flood-hit east of Spain on Monday to reinforce efforts to locate bodies and clear debris, as government officials traded blame over how the worst flooding in decades has been handled and as first aid packages were being readied.Public anger is mounting over the disaster that has killed at least 217 people with dozens of others still unaccounted for. Almost all of the deaths occurred in the Valencia region and more than 60 in the suburb of Paiporta.The army sent about 5,000 soldiers over the weekend to help distribute food and water, clean up streets and guard against looters and a further 2,500 would join them, Defence Minister Margarita Robles told state-owned radio RNE.A warship with 104 marine infantry soldiers as well as trucks with food and water arrived in Valencia port even as a strong hailstorm pummelled Barcelona some 300 km (186 miles) to the north.On Monday evening, Spanish minister Felix Bolanos from the Socialist Party said Tuesday’s cabinet would declare some of the worst hit villages by the floods in the regions of Valencia, Andalusia, Castile La Mancha and Catalonia as “severely affected areas” so that they can be entitled to emergency funds.He added that the government would approve on Tuesday a package of relief measures to help people cope with the situation without giving further details.Later, the regional head of Valencia, Carlos Mazon, said that his region would separately hand out each household 6,000 euros ($6,524) and make available at least 200,000 euros to help each town face urgent spending needs.In total, Mazon, of the conservative People’s Party, said the region would request from Spain’s central government a first aid package worth around 31.4 billion euros, including funds to reconstruct key infrastructure.On Monday, airport operator AENA said about 50 flights due to take off from Barcelona’s partially flooded El Prat airport were cancelled or severely delayed, while 17 due to land there were diverted. Some local train services were also cancelled.Rescuers used drones and water pumps to search and clear underground carparks and garages. They also scanned river mouths where currents may have deposited more bodies.“With these drones we can send them inside the garages and have a first visual of what’s going on,” police spokesperson Ricardo Gutierrez said.Opposition politicians accused the left-wing central government of acting too slowly to warn residents and send in rescuers.Mazon on Monday had previously said the Hydrographic Confederation of Jucar (CHJ), which measures the flow of rivers and ravines for the state, had cancelled a planned alert three times.But Madrid said the CHJ does not issue flood risk alerts, which are the responsibility of Spain’s regional governments.Delayed responseLocals criticised late alerts from authorities about the dangers and a perceived delayed response by emergency services.But General Javier Marcos, commander of the army’s emergency response services, said he had ordered 500 soldiers to be deployed within 15 minutes of seeing the flood warning on Tuesday who were able to enter hard-hit areas.“The degree of destruction is so great that mobility is limited,” he said. “It is so complex that it requires two things: discipline and patience.”On Sunday, some residents in Paiporta slung mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe and his wife, Queen Letizia, chanting: “murderers, murderers!”The prime minister was also struck during the protests, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said in an interview on TVE, blaming a handful of extremists for the trouble.“The majority of people gathered are absolutely peaceful people who have lost everything and whose anger we evidently understand,” Grande-Marlaska said.Locals in Paiporta said anger boiled over because they felt authorities were using them for a photo opportunity.They denied that the crowd was full of extremists.Belen, a 50-year-old supermarket cashier who lost both her cars during the flood, said she was angry with both the national and regional governments about how slowly help has arrived.“That’s what hurts us, that they only come here for a photo,” she said. “They’re all the same dog with different collars. They’re all scum.”A protest planned in Valencia on Saturday will call for Mazon to step down.A daily protest in Madrid outside the headquarters of Sanchez’s Socialist party drew more people on Sunday, about 600, due to anger over the floods, according to El Pais newspaper.The anger vented against all sides reflects a general disillusionment with the political class, analysts at Eurointelligence wrote in a note on Monday. “If the aftermath turns into a big finger-pointing exercise, it will probably deepen that anti-politics sentiment,” it said.Lack of clarity over the numbers of dead and missing has added to frustration. A landline has been set up for relatives to report the missing, with the government saying “dozens and dozens” are still unaccounted for.Coroner services on Monday said 190 autopsies had been performed, and 111 people identified.The midweek torrential rains caused rivers to swell, engulfing streets and ground floors of buildings, and sweeping away cars and masonry in tides of mud.Sonia Luque, coordinator of the Network of Road Assistance Companies (REAC), said more than 100,000 cars were damaged.It was the worst flood-related disaster in Europe in five decades. Scientists say extreme weather is more frequent due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. \nA selection committee led by Speaker Devraj Ghimire has recommended Suresh Acharya for the position of Chief Information Commissioner of the National Information Commission.Likewise, Gagan Bista and Durga Bhandari have been recommended as commissioners.The committee, which includes the Minister for Communications and Information Technology and the chair of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, finalised the recommendations on Monday and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications.Acharya is the former chair of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, while Bista, former chair of Press Chautari Nepal, serves as secretary of the UML’s publicity department.Bhandari, with a background in law, previously served as a member of the Nepal Press Council. They will be appointed following a decision by the Council of Ministers. \nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris both predicted victory as they campaigned across Pennsylvania on Monday in the final, frantic day of an exceptionally close US presidential election.The campaign has seen head-spinning twists: two assassination attempts and a felony conviction for Republican former President Trump, and Democratic Vice President Harris’ surprise elevation to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid under pressure from his own party. More than $2.6 billion has been spent to sway voters’ minds since March, according to AdImpact, an analytics firm.Nevertheless, opinion polls show Trump, 78, and Harris, 60, in a dead heat. The winner may not be known for days after Tuesday’s vote, though Trump has already signaled that he will attempt to fight any defeat, as he did in 2020.Both candidates converged on Pennsylvania on Tuesday to urge supporters who have not yet cast their ballots to show up on Election Day. The state offers the largest share of votes in the Electoral College of any of the seven battleground states expected to determine the outcome.“With this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. It belongs to you,” a weary-sounding Trump told a half-full arena in Reading, the second of four stops he had planned for the day. “Together we will fight, fight and we will win, win.”In Allentown, Harris predicted victory and promised to be a president for “all Americans,” as she appealed to the city’s substantial Puerto Rican community who were outraged by insults from a comedian at a Trump rally last week.“Do we believe in the promise of America, and are you ready to fight for it?” she asked the crowd. “Because when we fight, we win.”Both campaigns projected optimism.Harris’ campaign team said its volunteers knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in each of the battleground states this weekend.The campaign says its internal data shows that undecided voters are breaking in their favor, and says it has seen an increase in early voting among core parts of its coalition, including young voters and voters of color.Tom Bonier, head of the Democratic analytics firm TargetSmart, said the early vote showed high enthusiasm among Democratic-leaning groups, especially women. He said there was no indication of a similar surge among young men, a key target of the Trump campaign’s outreach.GENDER GAPTrump campaign officials said they were monitoring early-voting results that show more women have voted than men. That is significant given that Harris led Trump by 50% to 38% among female registered voters, according to an October Reuters/Ipsos poll, while Trump led among men 48% to 41%.“Men must vote!” the world’s richest person Elon Musk, a prominent Trump supporter, wrote on his X social media platform.Trump’s campaign has outsourced most of the voter outreach work to outside groups, including one run by Musk, which have focused on contacting supporters who do not reliably participate in elections, rather than undecided voters.A Pennsylvania judge ruled that Musk could continue his $1 million voter giveaway in the state, which a local prosecutor said amounted to an illegal lottery.Trump has vowed to protect women “whether the women like it or not” and said that the decision of whether to ban abortion should be up to individual states, after the conservative majority he cemented on the US Supreme Court in 2022 ended the nationwide right to abortion. In Reading, he vowed to keep transgender athletes out of women’s sports, as supporters waved pink “Women for Trump” signs behind him.One Trump campaign official said they thought the Republican would carry North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, which would still require him to carry one of battleground states in the Rust Belt — Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania — to win the White House. Republicans also appeared to be posting strong early-vote results in Nevada, and have been heartened by robust early-voting numbers in the hurricane-ravaged western counties of North Carolina.“The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race,” senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters. “We feel very good about where things are.”FALSE FRAUD CLAIMSTrump and his allies, who falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of fraud, have spent months laying the groundwork to again challenge the result if he loses. He has promised “retribution” if elected, spoken of prosecuting his political rivals and described Democrats as the “enemy from within.”Harris campaign officials said his attempts to allege fraud will fail. “Voters select the president, not Donald Trump,” Dana Remus, a campaign legal adviser, told reporters.Arizona’s top election official said an online video alleging that Republicans were being removed from voter rolls was false.Trump is due to campaign later in Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Michigan. He then plans to return to Palm Beach, Florida, to vote and await election results.Harris is due to campaign in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where she will end the day with a rally in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which will feature Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and Oprah Winfrey.She is expected to spend election night at Howard University in Washington, a historically Black college that is her alma mater. \nOn Tuesday, Koshi Province and the hilly regions will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, with the rest of the country expected to be partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in a few areas of Koshi Province and at isolated locations in the hilly areas of Bagmati and Sudurpaschim provinces. Rain and thunderstorms are also possible in isolated hilly areas across other provinces.Tonight, partly cloudy skies are expected in the hilly regions, while other areas will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair. Light rain with thunder and lightning may occur in isolated areas of the hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.The Meteorological Forecasting Division attributed these conditions to the influence of westerly and local winds across the country. \nTravellers on international airlines will soon benefit from higher compensation limits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons. \nDuring Dashain, the Bhandari family from Kathmandu gathered at their ancestral home in the east Nepal town of Damak in Jhapa district. Amid the festive atmosphere, Matrika Bhandari sat on the terrace with his five-year-old son, Soham. Soham tugged at his father’s sleeve, eager to show him the kites his cousins were flying outside.However, Bhandari’s attention was elsewhere—he was engrossed in his phone, scrolling through TikTok videos.After several failed attempts to get his father’s attention, Soham gave up. He wandered over to a corner of the room, found his tablet, and started playing a game. Later that evening, during dinner, Bhandari complained to his relatives, “I just don’t know what to do with Soham. Children of today can’t live without phones… He’s always glued to his tablet!”Ironically, as he voiced this concern, he was checking a WhatsApp message on his phone. What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds. \nTorrential rains in the last week of September caused devastation in many parts of the country. The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed. When disasters strike Nepal, the presence of the government in rescue and relief operations is usually symbolic: An earthmoving equipment here, an army unit there, or a team of bewildered police personnel at some places trying to cope with emergencies that they are neither trained nor equipped to handle. In a coping mechanism that is charitably called “the resilience of Nepali people”, the affected population is often back on its feet through individual efforts. Even though somewhat muted, the Hindu novena of Dashain was celebrated, and the preparations for the five-day-long Tihar festivities have already begun. Several squatters managed to reassemble their damaged shanties themselves in the floodplains soon after the rains subsided. Houses submerged due to overflowing drains in low-lying localities have been cleaned up through individual and community efforts. But in a testament to the apathy of all three tiers of the republican order in the country, debris deposited by floods continue to decompose in the riverbed, and plastic waste lifted by torrents still flutter like flags from branches of trees and lamp posts all along the Bagmati Corridor. Had the federal government considered it an emergency, an army team would have been deployed to clear the garbage from roads along the riverbed in the Kathmandu Valley within few days. The provincial government of Bagmati needed no new laws to show its presence during a calamity—even a symbolic act of the chief minister working with a shovel would have conveyed an uplifting message. Shamed into action, the Lalitpur metropolitan government has called upon its citizens to volunteer for the clean-up drive. It’s still not too late for the celebrity Mayor Balendra Shah to follow the lead of his senior colleague.Cultural rootsDespite loud claims to the contrary, almost all religions with their “packaged superstitions”—including political religions such as communism and free-market fundamentalism—are regressive, and Hinduism is no exception. With an established tradition of karma, vacuous pride in traditions and institutionalised inequality of caste hierarchy, it is harder for a republican order to take root in societies where the Sanatan Dharma is the dogma. If Hindu monarchs of the past were avatars of Vishnu, elected leaders seem to get away with characterisations such as “Durga astride a tiger” or a human being “not born biologically”. One doesn’t question a divine being even when the person must acquire political legitimacy through the popular mandate of lesser mortals. The transactional relationships of patronage and support between politicians and their followers aren’t uncommon, but the unquestioned loyalty of the herd to its shepherd perhaps owes its origin to the tribal instinct and religious beliefs extant in many societies.It seems the citizenry in Nepal get so little from their government and yet don’t complain because they have been conditioned to demand nothing from the representatives other than some personal favours in lieu of allegiance—an appointment, a contract or some assistance in favourably resolving a dispute—once in a while. Let alone integrity, even civility and decency are seldom expected from politicos who exercise control over the resources and instruments of the state. When the citizenry is apathetic, Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli can easily get away with a questionable largesse from an oligarch under investigation to build the headquarters of the ruling party. Despite his past entanglements—OMNI scandal, links with Yeti Group, Giri Bandhu land swap case, profligate actions and outrageous outbursts—Sharma Oli remains the unquestioned supremo of the CPN-UML and an idolised chieftain of the Khas-Arya ethnonationalists across party lines.Former Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Rabi Lamichhane, has been arrested and remanded into custody for further investigations of serious charges on judicial orders. The Supreme Court had once removed him from the office of the deputy prime minister and ousted him from the membership of the parliament for violating citizenship laws. In any other country, it would have meant the end of a political career, but in the land of “Never ending peace and love” that is Nepal, Lamichhane continues to command the fierce loyalty of White Shirts and “People Like Us” (PLUs) of the urban middle class.In a society where piety is more prevalent than virtue and rituals are more valued than rationality, it’s extremely difficult to institutionalise republican principles of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularity. No wonder followers blindly line up in support of their petty, populist and ‘elected monarchs’ such as Sharma Oli, Lamichhane, Shah, or even the Mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city Harka Sampang. In a deeply rooted culture of piety and fealty, a political manipulator can get away with anything as long as he—leadership is a male bastion—manages to dupe the flock with his bluster and bombast.Economic compulsionsHardcore adherents of republicanism may disagree, but just as authoritarianism is intrinsic to monarchism, financial improprieties are integral to almost all electoral systems that reward their winners with enormous authority to disburse concessions and distribute freebies to oligarchs who have funded their rise to power. Legal theorist Camila Vergara recognises the “systemic corruption” and argues that grassroot assemblies independent of political parties and representative government can help establish an “anti-oligarchic republic” of plebians. However, it’s not unusual for uncanny oligarchs to exploit grassroots movements.It was argued that the Tea Party movement morphed into Trumpism with Trump agreeing that it “still exists — except now it’s called Make America Great Again.” Even though Arvind Kejriwal was the direct beneficiary of Anna Hazare’s India Against Corruption (IAC) campaign of the PLUs in India, it also prepared the ground for the phenomenal spread of Hindutva politics. There is undoubtedly some merit in Ram Manohar Lohia’s roar in Hindi, “Agar sadkein khamosh ho jayein tau Sansad awaara ho jati hai (If the streets fall silent, the Parliament goes berserk)”. But irrespective of its plebian, oligarchic or liberal antecedents, all republics have to ultimately go to the polls to acquire or renew their legitimacy. Civic movements are necessary but not sufficient for the functioning of a republic.No matter how well designed an electoral system is, polls are always skewed in favour of political parties with competitively large purses. The temptation of fresh entrants into the electoral fray to fall for dubious domestic or foreign contributions is thus understandable even if not acceptable. There is no easy treatment for the endemic disease of democratic systems, but perhaps institutionalisation through broadening of the support base and continuous correction of political parties can help alleviate painful symptoms.Building a sustainable and responsible political party is a work of generations that requires an ideological commitment of organisers and supporters alike. When people pay, parties will be forced to become accountable. Premier Sharma Oli’s alleged plans to ease party splits through an ordinance are not just shortsighted but downright dangerous. Ambitious politicos need to discard their privileges if they wish to build new platforms for themselves.  \nUntil two years ago, growing crops was a big challenge for farmer Jit Bahadur Khamcha Magar of Palpa in western Nepal. He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties. Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog. He introduced round chillies to local farmers with the support from the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project. “In Palpa, it is now grown commercially,” said GC. Initially, there was no certainty whether the output would be good, he added. Janak Acharya of Palungmainadi who cultivated round chillies on 200 ropanies as trial.Round chilli cultivation expanded after the local government encouraged farmers in every ward, providing them with training and subsidies in seed purchase.GC is working on the marketing of round chillies.The Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog collects round chillies from farmers, ensures its market and grades the output. Production of green chillies starts from May. This facilitation has encouraged farmers to engage in round chilli farming, said Ranjib Kunwar, manager of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog.Kunwar said that most of the farmers bring their chilies to the factory. The farmers who do not take round chillies to the factory also make transactions of Rs10.5 million separately by selling them in the market. Traders supply round chillies to Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tansen and Pokhara.Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog sells red round chillies to noodle producers.Farmers of Ribdikot hope to earn Rs60 million from round chillies this year.So far, farmers have already sold round chillies for more than Rs30 million.Though the rural municipality supported round chilli cultivation in initial days, lately it has been providing subsidies in seeds only. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAfter being ousted from government leadership on July 12, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, finds itself in uncharted territory, facing a long spell out of power for the for the first time in nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon. \nAs the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties. Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, addressing a mass gathering organised by the party in Kathmandu, stressed two issues on Saturday—that his party wasn’t in a hurry to bring down the present government and that they took to the streets to expose the government’s bad governance.Dahal claimed his party is now focused on introspection, reviewing the party’s activities and connecting with the people.Addressing the gathering, which was also projected as a show of force by the main opposition party, Dahal claimed the top Maoist leadership has undpledgedertaken a serious review of the party’s activities and that they won’t engage in any manoeuvring to topple the present government.“Our party made a mistake by forging alliance with reactionary forces in the past but we now vow not to repeat that mistake,” Dahal said. He to be honest with the people hereon.“Rest assured and run the government, don’t worry much about whether the Maoists will again come to power.”Observers, however, doubt Dahal’s claim as it has only been just over 100 days since the Maoist party was ousted from the government. They also say the party, while being in the government for most of the past decade or so, hasn’t achieved much.Moreover, whatever Dahal might say, there is no way to remove the government unless there is a tussle between the two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.The observers thus see the Maoist Centre’s protest as an outcome of the Maoist leaders’ restlessness over being out of the government for some months. In the 275-strong House of Representatives that elects the prime minister, the biggest coalition partner, the Congress, has 88 seats while the prime minister’s UML party has 78 seats. Thus the two largest coalition partners alone command a comfortable majority. Some other fringe parties have also joined the government. Maoist Centre General Secretary Dev Gurung says Dahal addressed the issue after a meeting of the ruling parties on Friday concluded that efforts were on to topple the government.“Attempts to seek an alternative to the democratic system and government cannot be acceptable,” said the seven-point joint statement of the ruling parties. Gurung said that they just tried to clear the misconception. “Despite having a majority in the House, the way they are panicking about a possible government change is something unusual,” he said.Political experts said the only way to change the government at present is by proving a majority in the House.“The Maoists always get restless when they are not in the government, and it is no different now,” Mumaram Khanal, a political analyst, told the Post. “Today’s agitation is nothing but a means to show that the party’s relevance will remain intact until the next elections.”The Maoist Centre is a party that has been in power for most of the nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.But why did the party have to call for a protest no sooner than it had left the government? Maoist Centre General Secretary Gurung refused to answer the question. But when the same query was put before Agni Sapkota, vice-chair and spokesperson for the Maoist Centre, he accused the Oli government of failing on all fronts save for its initiative to push for the completion of the peace process. “That is one reason which compelled us to organise a meeting of this kind,” Sapkota said.After the formation of the UML-Congress coalition in mid-July, the ruling parties including the main opposition have amended the transitional justice related law.Similarly, the party leaders who spoke at the mass gathering on Saturday raised questions about the prime minister’s prolonged absence from the country even as Nepal was being ravaged by floods and landslides.Prime Minister Oli was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly at the time. Some people then accused the prime minister of showing insensitivity after he refused to cut short his US trip. When the Post talked to some participants of Saturday’s mass gathering, they struggled to come up with a rationale for the protest programme. But a few of them did question the Oli government’s record on governance and the prime minister’s supposed protection of the corrupt people in the government even while cracking down on those from opposition parties. They also questioned the UML’s acceptance of a piece of expensive real estate from a controversial businessman. Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, on October 11 donated land to build the UML head office. Gurung is facing multiple corruption and fraud cases in court.“The Oli government has failed on multiple fronts and is working to protect the corrupt people,” one participant told the Post. “The previous government [led by Dahal] was toppled after it tried to prosecute corrupt politicians.”During his address, Dahal asked for answers from the government on the status of the investigation on the Bhutanese refugee scam, as well as on other alleged fraud cases such as the Bansbari land grab and Giribandhu Tea Estate scam. Dahal accused the government of protecting corrupt officials and sidestepping accountability measures. “This government appears to have been formed to shield—not expose—corruption,” he said.The Maoist chief also questioned why leaders from the UML and the Congress who have also been accused of misappropriating funds from various cooperatives, have faced no action. “Those named in the [parliamentary panel] report should be investigated and arrested if guilty,” he said, adding that selectively targeting opposition members for investigation is unjust.But political analyst Khanal doesn’t buy the argument. “Until today, which government has taken action against powerful people?” he questions. “What Dahal is saying is propaganda,” Khanal told the Post. While the Maoist Centre is accusing the government of not acting against some suspects in corruption scams, Khanal questioned why the suspects were not brought under the purview of the law while Dahal was the prime minister. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday. While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” \nKathmandu Metropolitan City designates 47 locations for florists and vendors to reduce congestion and avoid last year's sales issues, encouraging the use of Nepali flowers and prohibiting plastic bouquets.\nA bus accident in Kharipati leaves ten injured, two in critical condition after colliding with a pole.\nKathmandu Valley Police relaunch no-horn campaign, focusing on noise pollution reduction and stricter enforcement against violators.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City, in response to worsening air quality, will initiate vehicle emission testing after acquiring a smoke meter, with the support of other stakeholders and in accordance with established guidelines.\nDashain public transport ticket bookings commence Saturday with enhanced safety measures, online options, and 24/7 citizen assistance despite concerns over road conditions and high demand.\nIncreased access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene in Nepal could reduce malaria and dengue cases while combating climate change, which poses significant economic and health risks for the region, urging urgent action for adaptation and mitigation.\n\nTihar festival, celebrated on Wednesday, faces elevated expenses due to increased prices of goods, especially food, flowers, gifts, and lights, attributed to heavy rainfall affecting production and imports.\n\nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nOfficers and employees at the Ministry of Health and Population and the Department of Health Services will receive training on coping with mental health problems.Officials hope that the training will help employees understand common mental health conditions and identify warning signs of depression, anxiety, stress and other psychological issues.“Employees are human beings too and can suffer from various health conditions, including mental health conditions,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have planned to impart one-day training to the employees at the Health Ministry and the Department of Health Services.”Officials say that 80 of the 160 employees serving at the Health Ministry and at the Department of Health Services will receive training first, and the rest will receive it another day. They say the training would be provided to employees of other ministries only if they get positive results from the training imparted to Health Ministry officials.Studies carried out in the past show that the majority of government officials at Singha Durbar suffered from multiple health complications such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney diseases, anxiety and depression. Health problems could have been exacerbated since the workplace environment hasn’t improved, the studies showed.Singha Durbar is the country’s federal administrative heart where most ministries and important government offices are located. Reports show that many civil servants are unaware of their health ailments.Doctors say a sedentary lifestyle, poor eating habits and stress contribute to the health crisis among government employees. They advise employees to visit a hospital if they feel something is wrong with their health.Of late, noncommunicable diseases have emerged as the leading killers in Nepal, and its reflection can also be seen among government employees.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that the diseases accounted for 71 percent of the country's deaths.The study shows that hypertension, diabetes, renal malfunction, liver problems, heart issues and cervical cancer are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in Nepal.The findings showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, and high cholesterol and kidney dysfunction, among others.The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, heavyweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.To address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, the government has previously announced that it will carry out free screening of non-communicable diseases of people over 40. However, the programme has not yet been started.Public health experts say the increase in non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon, but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden.They say that many lives can be saved if people are screened for non-communicable diseases for free. \nAs Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel is on a spree announcing one populist programme after another, health agencies under his ministry are reaching out to aid organisations for small amounts to basic training.Officials say they do not even have the budget to provide mental health screening training to children and adolescents, and this has delayed the planned programme.“We have been asking aid agencies for help to carry out training programmes for health workers,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The minister is busy unveiling new free programmes but does not bother to learn about the real problems.”On Monday and Tuesday, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes that include free treatment for children under 14 with cancer, free treatment and health check-ups for women soccer players injured in matches, and upgrades to the Sailaja Acharya Heart Disease Centre in Biratnagar. Last week, Paudel pledged free care for poor burn victims who cannot afford treatment. However, most health facilities offering burn care provide only basic treatments, which often puts patients' safety at risk. Since taking office three months ago, Minister Paudel has announced several other populist programmes.While most of these initiatives—which include reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—have yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce more free programmes.Experts have questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of such programmes stating that previous ministers and governments would also have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Only those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different,” said Sagar Rjbhandari, a health expert. Many other health programmes, including nutritious food for pregnant and nursing mothers and children in Karnali Province, as well as maternal and perinatal death surveillance, among others, have been affected by budget constraints in the current fiscal year.Health Ministry officials said they have requested UNICEF for financial help to impart mental health screening training of children for health workers.“We need around Rs700,000 to train health workers, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics, on mental health screening for children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “UNICEF has responded positively to our request. A four-day screening training will be organised in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.”Officials said that they plan to train 150 health workers.“We hope that the health worker training will help reduce existing mental health problems among children and adolescents,” said Thapa. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first to ensure that children and adolescents in villages will easily access the services.”A report from the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most common at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while the rate of suicidal attempts in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts, and the future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to affect 7.2 percent of the population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey may not accurately portray the actual problems.Health officials say that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers identify problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal. \nDozens of children with severe urological birth defects and rare urological conditions in HCM City, Vinh, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng are receiving free genital surgeries under the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme – a project that offers child genital reconstruction surgeries in Việt Nam.Part of an annual programme that started 18 years ago, these surgeries are being performed from October 18 to November 9 by a volunteer medical team from Italy, England, Egypt and the UAE, led by Italian surgeon Dr Roberto De Castro.The surgeries take place at Children’s Hospital 2 in HCM City, the Nghệ An Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in Vinh City, the National Pediatric Hospital and Việt Đức Hospital in Hà Nội, and the Đà Nẵng Children and Women’s Hospital in Đà Nẵng City.Over decades, Dr De Castro has performed pioneering surgical techniques to effectively treat genital malformations and injuries in both boys and girls to allow them to live full lives.One of De Castro’s biggest success stories is Phùng Thiện Nhân, who was abandoned by his biological mother at birth in a remote area in the central province of Quảng Nam. When Nhân was found three days later, he was barely alive and had lost most of his genitals and one leg due to a brutal attack by wild animals.The infant survived the incident and was subsequently adopted by journalist Trần Mai Anh, moving to Hà Nội with his new family. With the support of De Castro, Thiện Nhân received successful reconstructive surgery in January 2011.His foster mother, Mai Anh, later became the founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme which, together with the Asia Injury Prevention (AIP) Foundation, pays for surgeries, travel costs and medical supplies for poor Vietnamese children needing genital reconstruction.Over the years, the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme has conducted 630 surgeries, examinations and diagnoses for 2,000 children, with another 1,000 patients still awaiting treatment.Dozens of leading experts in paediatric reconstructive and urological surgery from around the world have participated in the programme. In Việt Nam, along with conducting examinations and surgeries, the international specialists also hold scientific workshops and hands-on training sessions with Vietnamese medical staff, sharing their experiences and introducing the latest advanced methods in paediatric urological surgery.According to founder of the AIP Foundation and co-founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme Greig Craft, the mission of the progamme is not just to treat a small number of children with genital disabilities.“By spreading the inspiration to live and sharing medical knowledge as leading experts come together, we believe that the impact will extend beyond the confines of the programme. We are fortunate that Thiện Nhân, our first patient, shares this vision and has chosen to become a scientist in the future,” he said.Eighteen years after being found in the jungle and given a second chance at life, Thiện Nhân has entered university. He chose the field of Artificial Intelligence, believing that “AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare and improve the lives of many people, just as my life was transformed through medical intervention”. From these 18 years of experience, the young man is convinced that “empathy and patience will lead to miraculous achievements”.-In Association with ANN \nMinister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel announced on Sunday that the government would provide free treatment to children under 14 years of age suffering from various types of cancer.The move is the latest in a series of populist announcements made by Paudel since taking office around three months ago.While most of these initiatives—reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—are yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce new free programmes.According to a press statement issued by Paudel’s secretariat, free cancer treatment will be provided by Kanti Children's Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, and Chitwan-based BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital, starting November 16. The federal government has already been providing Rs100,000 in relief to each cancer patient, including children, while the provincial government provides another Rs100,000. Officials said that the Health Ministry will cover any additional amount required for the treatment of children under 14 years with cancer from its internal sources.A few days ago, Paudel also promised free care for impoverished burn victims who cannot afford treatment costs.However, most health facilities that offer burn care provide only basic treatment, which often do not ensure patient safety.Experts have welcomed the government’s decisions. However, they questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of the programmes announced by Paudel. They say that previous ministers and governments would have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Most programmes announced by the current health minister cannot be implemented due to various limitations,” said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, a health expert. “Those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different.”Due to the lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants, and other tests available for children, patients are often compelled to travel to India for treatment. Health facilities providing cancer care for children said that they lacked support staff, including trained nurses and paramedics. “Along with the decision to provide free care to children with cancer, we hope the government will invest in improving health facilities with the necessary equipment and trained human resources, which will help ensure quality care within the country,” said Dr Sudhir Sapkota, a pediatric oncologist at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Many patients cannot afford to go to India for these tests.”According to doctors, PET scans are essential for determining the stage of cancer. This test provides more accurate reports than any other in identifying local or metastatic tumours (which spread to other areas of the body).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict response, and determine likely disease outcomes. It also helps distinguish between different types of cancer.Likewise, bone marrow replacement is necessary when existing bone marrow fails to work properly with new stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation provides new stem cells, which help kill cancer cells directly.“‘If we can start offering the aforementioned services within the country, patients do not have to go India or other countries for treatment,” said Sapkota. “I hope the government will also work to address these shortcomings in the coming days.”It is estimated that every year in Nepal, around 1,500 children under 14 years of age suffer from various types of cancer. Of them, around 200 seek treatment at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. Doctors at the hospital said that around 50 percent of the patients suffer from blood cancer. Those seeking care at the first and second stages of cancer have a chance of full recovery. However, due to a lack of diagnosis facilities in most parts of the country, many patients seek treatment at the third and fourth stages. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal suffered a 37-run loss to the US in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 tri-series match on Saturday in Dallas, US.Batting first, the US set a challenging total of 281-8 in their 50 overs. Captain Monank Patel led with a composed 67 off 81 balls, supported by Saiteja Mukkamalla’s 75 off 87, building a solid foundation. Late in the innings, Harmeet Singh added crucial runs, smashing 59 off 44 balls to push the total past 280.For Nepal, Gulsan Jha was the pick of the bowlers, claiming three wickets, while Sandeep Lamichhane and Sompal Kami took two each.In response, Nepal’s chase started poorly with Aasif Sheikh falling in the second over. Anil Sah steadied the innings with 52 off 80 balls, while Kushal Bhurtel’s 29 took Nepal to 106-2 by the 27th over. However, Sah’s dismissal sparked a collapse, including the quick departure of captain Rohit Paudel for just 1.Sompal Kami injected late energy with a brisk 46 off 27 balls, hitting four boundaries and two sixes, but his efforts couldn’t bridge the gap as Nepal were bowled out for 244 in 49.5 overs.US bowlers were disciplined, with Saurabh Netravalkar taking 4-47, supported by Jasdeep Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, and Nosthush Kenjige, who each played a role in restricting Nepal’s chase. \nNepal’s run in the Hong Kong International Sixes tournament ended in the third quarter-finals on Saturday, with a 40-run defeat to Sri Lanka at Mong Kok. Sri Lanka set a challenging target of 124 runs after finishing on 123-2 in six overs.Sandun Weerakkody was a standout for Sri Lanka, retiring hurt after a blistering 50 off just 14 balls, which included four fours and five sixes. Captain Lihuru Madhusanka added a quick-fire 31 off 8 balls, while Lahiru Samarakoon’s 22 from 5 balls bolstered Sri Lanka’s impressive total.

Rashid Khan provided a glimmer of hope with a rapid 55 off 18 balls, hitting eight sixes, but lacked sufficient support from his teammates to chase down the target. Samarakoon’s 2-6 in one over and Tharindu Rathnayake’s 2-24 further curtailed Nepal’s run rate, and they finished at 83-6 in 5 overs.Lahiru Samarakoon was named Player of the Match for his all-round performance. Nepal reached the quarter-finals from Pool B after impressive victories over England and Australia. \nNepal edged out Australia by 11 runs in a thrilling match of the Hong Kong International Sixes at Mong Kok on Saturday.Winning the toss, Australia opted to field first, setting the stage for an explosive batting display from Nepal.Captain Sundeep Jora led Nepal’s innings, hammering 51 runs off just 16 balls with five fours and four sixes before retiring hurt. Lokesh Bam provided solid support with 33 off 13 balls, hitting three boundaries and three sixes. Bibek Yadav added a quick-fire 12 off 4 balls, while Rashid Khan’s late cameo of 12 off just 2 balls helped Nepal put a 112-run target.In response, Australia started shakily, losing captain Sam Heazlett early to Pratis GC for just one run. Jack Wood was the standout for Australia, scoring an impressive 55 off 16 balls with four boundaries and six sixes.Despite Wood’s efforts, Australia struggled against Nepal’s disciplined bowling, particularly Pratis GC, who claimed three wickets for 24 runs in his two overs. Other contributions from the Nepali bowlers included a wicket each from Lokesh Bam and Bibek Yadav to help the Rhinos restrict Australia to 100 runs.Earlier on Friday, Nepal defeated England by six wickets.

Harris, 60, was catapulted to the top of the Democratic ticket in July - giving her a chance to become the first woman to hold the world’s most powerful job – after President Joe Biden, 81, had a disastrous debate performance and three weeks later dropped his reelection bid under pressure from his party.For all of that turmoil, the contours of the race have changed little. Polls show Harris and Trump running neck and neck nationally and in the battleground states. More than 77 million voters have already cast ballots, but the next two days will provide a critical test of whether Vice President Harris’ or former President Trump’s campaign does the better job of driving supporters to the polls.Voters, both Democrats and Republicans, have broken century-old records in the last two presidential elections, a sign of the passion that Trump stirs in both political parties.Jones reshaped modern pop music in his collaborations with Michael Jackson, while renowned for his work with stars like Frank Sinatra.In the final days of this campaign, both sides are flooding social media sites and TV and radio stations with a last round of ad campaigns, and racing to knock on doors and make calls.Harris’ campaign team believes the sheer size of its voter mobilization efforts is making a difference and says its volunteers knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in each of the battleground states this weekend.”We are feeling very good about where we are right now,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters.The campaign says its internal data shows that undecided voters are breaking in their favor, particularly women in the battleground states, and that they see an increase in early voting among core parts of their coalition, including young voters and voters of color.Trump’s campaign has its own in-house canvassing operation, but has effectively outsourced most of the work to outside super PACs, allied political groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.They have been more focused on contacting “low propensity” voters, or voters that often do not go to the polls, instead of appealing to middle-of-the-road voters who can flip to either side.Many in this category are Trump supporters, but they are not normally reliable voters.By cherry-picking the voters they want to contact, Trump and his team say they are sending door knockers to places where it makes a difference and being smart about spending.False Fraud ClaimsTrump and his allies, who falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of fraud, have spent months laying the groundwork to again challenge the result if he loses. He has promised “retribution,” spoken of prosecuting his political rivals and described Democrats as the “enemy within.”On Sunday, Trump complained about gaps in the bullet-proof glass surrounding him as he spoke at a rally and mused that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get him, adding, “I don't mind that so much.”Harris has cast Trump as a danger to democracy but sounded optimistic at a Detroit church on Sunday.“As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states to so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice,” Harris said. “And the great thing about living in a democracy, as long as we can hold on to it, is that we have the power, each of us, to answer that question.”Voters responding to a late-October Reuters/Ipsos poll ranked threats to democracy as the second-biggest problem facing the US today, just behind the economy.Trump believes concerns about the economy and high prices, especially for food and rent, will carry him to the White House.“We’re going to cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America,” Trump said on Sunday at a midday rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania.His final day of campaigning on Monday will include stops in three of the seven battleground states expected to determine the winner. He will visit Raleigh, North Carolina; Reading and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and Grand Rapids, Michigan. He then plans to return to Palm Beach, Florida, to vote and await election results.Harris plans to spend Monday campaigning in Pennsylvania, starting her day in Allentown, one of the most competitive parts of the state, before heading on to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states, offering 19 of the 270 Electoral College votes a candidate needs to win the presidency.Nonpartisan US election analysts calculate Harris needs to win about 45 electoral votes in the seven swing states to win the White House, while Trump would need about 51, when accounting for the states they are forecast to win easily. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepali universities do not own and run academic presses, which are units that commission and publish academic works in the form of books and journals. Today, I am only concerned about books published by such entities.Nepal’s oldest university, Tribhuvan University (TU), does own a printing press. Started most likely in the early 1970s, it was then called University Press and has now become Tribhuvan University Press. While this entity might be necessary to print TU stationery such as the question papers for the many exams it conducts each year, I am not referring to such a physical press. Instead, I am talking about a proper publishing unit that solicits and commissions academic books and manages their peer-review process. Regarding manuscripts accepted for publication, the unit will also handle the copy-editing, layout and proofreading to see the book through to final production. In other words, I am looking for publishing units with imprints that might have names like Tribhuvan University Press, Kathmandu University Press and Pokhara University Press.University presses elsewhereThe university presses that mostly publish academic works (although increasingly also some general interest books) have existed in Europe and North America for a while. Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press were established in the 16th century and are associated with the two eponymous British Universities. Some of the oldest university presses in the US such as the Johns Hopkins University Press and the University of Chicago Press are more than 120 years old. There are similar university presses in continental Europe, like Amsterdam University Press, and in Australia, like Melbourne University Publishing. Closer to our country, there are university presses in Japan (Kyoto University Press), Singapore (National University of Singapore Press) and Thailand (Chulalongkorn University Press). India does not have a strong tradition of such presses. The new Ashoka University has entered into a co-publishing arrangement with the publisher Permanent Black to put out books under the “Hedgehog & Fox” series. Most of the university presses do not make a profit. They serve the public via the production of academic texts. Their business operations are subsidised for the most part by their mother universities or subventions from third parties. In the US, these third parties have included the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Their daily operations are managed by professionals with diverse experience in publishing. Each unit is usually supervised by a committee of academics from inside and outside the associated university. The Association of University Presses has more than 160 members from different countries. The American university press system was professionalised two decades after World War II. Since then, as former director of the University of Michigan Press Phil Pochoda explained in a 2012 article, the American university presses have provided a very important service for the larger academic community. As “superior teaching, institutional service, and professional reputation were no longer sufficient for moving into and up the faculty ranks,” the quality “of publication became … the primary qualification for faculty appointment” and promotion. Pochoda continued: “If administrations were to require published books as a major part of a decision on faculty tenure or promotion, then it was necessary for the books to arrive at that decision point already professionally authorised… (by) credentialed external reviewers.” Since there are only about 100 plus university presses in America and about 4,000 higher education institutions, Pochada suggested that these university “presses … are in fact subsidising… other universities and colleges.” Even as many features of the print-based American university press system of the previous century have been undone by the ongoing digital transitions in scholarly publishing, it still retains a solid role in the higher education landscape of the US.Possible hereNepal had a late start in academic publishing. When the print-based university press system was being fully finalised in America during the 1960s, Nepal’s oldest university, TU, had just started publishing scholarly resources such as the Journal of the Tribhuvan University (established 1964). Its departments and research centres started putting out their own publications in the 1970s. Even as publications by faculty members became important for their recruitment and promotion in the later decades, no decisions seem to have taken place regarding the starting of a publishing imprint inside TU. Triratna Manandhar, a former professor of history who taught at TU for about 40 years (from 1967 onwards) and served as humanities and social science dean for eight years, does not recall any conversation on this subject. Historian Bhaveswar Pangeni, who has written a book on the institutional history of TU and has done extensive research on the archives of the minutes of TU’s executive council, does not recall seeing a record of any related discussion. In its initial years, one can make the excuse that TU’s collective research community was a small one and hence something like TU Press was not viable. Given the significant increase in the number of researchers who work for TU and elsewhere, this excuse does not hold for the post-1990 period.The situation is not much different in our newer universities. Kathmandu University is now 30 plus years old and employs dozens of fine researchers in many different disciplines. In a functional university that exercises a good degree of autonomy and holds international aspirations, it is surprising that something like a Kathmandu University Press does not exist already. However, the former dean of its School of Arts, Sagar Raj Sharma, has told me that conversations around such an idea have been ongoing for a while. Everything done by Western universities need not be copied by Nepali universities. However, since universities are perceived to be the most legitimate source of knowledge production and distribution, starting university presses in our country would be a good idea. The truth is that a few academics in each of our universities who care about good scholarship could put together publishing programmes if they got their act together. Such an initiative will of course require the blessings of our university leaders, investments on interested people and some infusion of money. Faculty members could be provided incentives to take up publishing-related positions for three or more years. The needed money can be earmarked in funds made available to universities by the University Grants Commission or third parties. Academics working in research institutions inside and outside of Nepal with substantial publishing experiences could be recruited to serve as members of the supervisory boards.Some folks think that the era of printed books is already over. I don’t think that is the case. Print runs of recent academic books published in Nepal are larger than those in neighbouring India for a reason. The books still sell in Nepal. Hence, Nepali university presses should put out some great academic books—monographs reporting new research or those that synthesise the most recent knowledge on any given subject, edited volumes of new writings, or readers of old writings—desired by academics, students and members of the public. The collaborative work needed to run university presses might even ameliorate the deleterious effects of bhagbanda spoils in our universities. \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the world’s longest reigning female political leader, fled Bangladesh on August 5 2024, for the safety of India. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of protesters descended on Bangladesh’s capital city, Dhaka. The crowds ransacked her official residence, occupied the nation’s parliament and burnt down her family home.Hasina, who had ruled the country for more than 20 years in total, had been widely accused of turning autocratic and clamping down severely on any opposition to her rule.For many, the Bangladesh revolution offers hope in the context of growing global authoritarianism. It illustrates the power of the youth to confront entrenched leaders, and the fragility of authoritarianism. It also highlights a striking feature of contemporary global politics: how central capital cities are to the political life of nations.In our new book, Controlling the Capital: Political Dominance in the Urbanizing World, a diverse range of scholars argue that capital cities are crucial political sites. They’re where governing elites seek to assert and maintain political control, and they are also stages for political contestation.The book is focused on sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the two fastest-urbanising regions of the world.Authors explore the strategies and tactics used by ruling elites to politically dominate their capital cities in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The authors also consider how urban populations have engaged with these efforts. People may resist authority, but they can also cooperate with it in ways that benefit themselves—which sometimes reinforces or supports authoritarian control.This is increasingly important in the context of two contemporary trends. First, authoritarianism is growing globally. Just 10 years ago under half of the world’s population lived under authoritarian rule; now the figure is at 71 percent. The second trend is the ongoing rapid urbanisation of the world’s population, with the majority of us globally now living in urban areas.Urban unrestOver the past year we’ve seen how capital cities are spaces for contestation.Some pro-democracy movements draw from their own histories of struggle and the paths that have been carved by those before them. The template of Bangladesh’s 2024 revolution is ingrained in politics from the ways in which liberation was fought and how later struggles against authoritarian rule were won. The capital city has also been crucial, and students at Dhaka University were key mobilisers in such movements.In other contexts, the link between political resistance and urban areas is a relatively new and surprising route to political change. One example is “the struggle” seen in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo and the unseating of the Rajapaksa family, who were perceived as increasingly authoritarian rulers of the country. The Colombo chapter in this volume highlights how such protests emerged in a context where urban unrest had rarely threatened those in power before.Even where anti-authoritarian protests have proved futile time and again, urban populations rarely remain quiet.In Kampala, Uganda, demonstrations prior to the 2021 elections resulted in a horrifying government crackdown. Inspired by events in neighbouring Kenya, protesters took to the streets once more in July 2024 to demonstrate against corruption.The protests that erupted in Nairobi from late June 2024 against tax rises engulfed the capital city. They continued for some time, fuelled by the brutal police response. Similarly, Nigeria’s 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality created a powerful movement in cities such as Abuja and Lagos which shook government, and resonated across much of the continent.In an age of social media, learning and mimicry across national borders is increasingly common. One of the defining images of Kenya’s 2024 urban uprising was of a group of men with their arms raised and crossed at the wrists—a gesture of anti-authoritarian protest that gained particular resonance several years back during neighbouring Ethiopia’s own uprising.As urban protest seems set to continue and spread—often taking intentionally similar forms—techniques of urban authoritarian control are more varied and complex.Strategies to dominate and control city populations can be dramatic and repressive—such as the brute force of police violence—and they can also be subtle, deeply ingrained, and sometimes difficult to discern.Authoritarian tacticsOur book argues that authoritarian leaders are increasingly aware of the power of the urban masses. As a result, they are using a range of subtle, and not-so-subtle, tactics to entrench their domination in capital cities.We broadly described two types of interventions that elites use.The first are policies and favours that actively build support among urban groups. These can range from inclusion in political parties to investments in social provisions or infrastructure to win support. The book’s chapter on Addis Ababa shows how the latter were particularly striking under the previous governing regime in Ethiopia.The second are repressive interventions that aim to crush opposition. These are also diverse, and include violent crackdowns, but also surveillance and intimidation.In practice, the two types of interventions often overlap. The line also blurs through various forms of manipulation. For instance, misinformation or the delivery of goods in exchange for performances of political loyalty, underpinned by implicit threats of coercion.We also highlight the significance of urban geography.Ruling elites often seek to divide city populations (for example inner-city dwellers versus the peripheries). This is evident in our book’s chapter on Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Rajapaksas tried to consolidate power by appealing to the new middle class suburbanites through “beautification” projects. But these displaced and excluded the inner-city poor.Chapters on Harare and Kampala also show how particular peripheral areas have become central to efforts to build an urban support base by Zanu-PF and the National Resistance Movement. This often plays out through the informal parcelling out of land to supporters.Contesting autocratic ruleConcerns about authoritarian politics are at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the contestation of autocratic rule will continue to erupt in cities, especially in rapidly urbanising parts of the world. In this context, the need to understand how autocracy and urbanisation collide could hardly be more important.If pro-democracy forces are to have any hope of prevailing against efforts by authoritarian ruling elites to entrench their position, there is a crucial need to better understand their urban strategies and tactics.

Taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, COP 29 is a critical platform for nations to collectively chart and negotiate a course of action on climate change.Alongside other negotiations, this year’s COP will especially focus on establishing a new era in climate finance with the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which will determine the financial support that developed countries provide developing nations for climate action. The goal builds upon a previous commitment made by developed countries in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020. This target was met for the first time in 2022, albeit with ongoing debates about its accuracy, adequacy and effectiveness.The NCQG is not merely a financial instrument; it embodies accountability, equity and justice principles. Developed countries bear historical responsibility for the climate crisis, while developing countries, often disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, require significant support to mitigate risks and adapt to a changing climate. The devasting floods ravaged Nepal in the last week of September, claiming more than 200 lives and causing widespread destruction with estimated economic losses of Rs17 billion. This reminds us of this vulnerability and the urgent need for increased investment in climate adaptation measures. Importantly, the floods also highlight the escalating intensity of climate impacts and the skyrocketing demand for climate finance, particularly for adaptation. Yet, the disbursement of funds falls far short of what is required, and access to existing funds remains a significant challenge for vulnerable nations. For instance, a 2024 report by OECD/IEA reveals that of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance between 2021-22, developing countries received only an average of $179 billion, with just $30 billion going to the least developed countries (LDCs). These figures are despite the claims of overreporting of climate finance funds from developed countries, meaning that actual amounts could be even less. This illustrates the meagre reach of climate finance for low-income and least developed nations. The modality of climate finance disbursement is another contentious issue. A report by Climate Policy Initiative in 2023 shows that 61 percent of financial flows are in the form of debt instruments, while 33 percent are in the form of equity, and only 5 percent are in the form of grants. Approximately $561 billion was provided at market rates of the total debt, making up 53 percent of total tracked climate finance. This heavy dependence on debt as finance disbursement modalities to developing nations further exacerbates their financial burdens, many of which already face stagnant economies highly reliant on vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. Extreme weather events can further strain their resources, forcing them to divert significant portions of their budgets towards debt repayment instead of crucial adaptation and resilience-building measures.Charting a new courseA decisive shift is needed in how we approach climate finance. Given the increasing urgency to invest in climate action, the role of negotiators from LDCs like Nepal at COP29 can be instrumental in shaping the NCQG. To ensure that no nation is left behind in the fight against climate change, the NCQG should prioritise the following things.It is unacceptable that only 2 percent of global climate finance reached LDCs in 2021-22. The core challenges hindering LDCs from accessing climate finance include a lack of technical resources for project preparation, limited project management capacity, burdensome and inconsistent financier requirements, an inability to coordinate effectively with donors and financiers, weak public financial management practices and insufficient technical expertise in climate change programming. Therefore, when setting targets, the NCQG should incorporate elements that make finance more approachable and accessible for LDCs, considering the challenges they already endure.Climate finance has disproportionately focused on mitigation rather than adaptation for far too long. Despite global climate finance surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2021–22, only $63 billion (5 percent) was tracked as adaptation finance. The Adaptation Finance Gap 2023 estimates that the financial gap of adaptation is projected to reach as high as $415 annually by 2030. Closing this gap is where the NCQG could set strong targets, potentially leading to estimating and creating binding agreements to bridge the adaptation finance gap.Business, as usual, is fueling a climate catastrophe. The total cost of inaction could cost the global economy $1,266 trillion by the end of the century, according to the State of the Global Climate 2023 report. This is even if warming is limited to the ambitious target of 1.5 degrees Celcius. Annual climate finance will need to grow more than six-fold, reaching nearly $9 trillion by 2030 and further increasing to $10 trillion by 2050. In light of this, the NCQG must act as a catalyst for the urgent mobilisation of resources for adaptation and mitigation. Every dollar invested today will save countless dollars—and lives—tomorrow. While the need for increased climate finance is undeniable, ensuring it is fairly distributed and reaches the needy is equally crucial. Developing countries, often lacking the capacity to navigate complex funding mechanisms, are either being left behind or are struggling for years to access urgently required climate finance. The NCQG must champion equity, accessibility and faster disbursement, empowering vulnerable nations to take ownership. This means simplifying procedures and ensuring that funding reaches local communities where it can make the biggest difference.The World Economic Forum emphasises that the climate crisis is too big, too serious and too urgent to rely solely on the resources of public institutions. The NCQG negotiations must incentivise private sector involvement by creating an enabling environment in climate-friendly initiatives such as clean energy, sustainable transport, green infrastructure and climate-resilient agriculture. Although climate investments often require a long-term perspective, such projects’ social benefits and sustainability can offer a win-win for both the private sector and society. Finally, transparency is the bedrock of effective climate action. This means accurately tracking climate finance and distinguishing it from traditional development aid. Furthermore, innovative and equitable mechanisms are needed to maximise the impact of limited funds. By promoting greater transparency and developing innovative mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of climate investments, we may be able to ensure that these limited funds can be meaningfully used to achieve a sustainable future. This requires robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks that track progress, identify challenges and inform adaptive management strategies.These considerations are just the tip of the iceberg. Addressing the climate crisis demands a long-term commitment to transformative change, encompassing financial mechanisms, technological innovation, policy reforms and shifts in societal behaviour. The NCQG negotiations at COP29 represent a critical opportunity to lay the foundation for this transformative change, which is crucial for tackling the climate crisis. \nNepal has again shown how ill-prepared and neglectful it is about running a project built and handed over by a foreign friend. This has been Nepal’s chronic problem mainly after the 1990 political change: Nepali authorities have turned several entities built by or with the support of foreign donors into non-functioning bodies. The latest victim of neglect is the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway. India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been helping Nepal operate the railway by providing its staffers to run trains along the route. The Indian Railway Construction International Limited had built the section and handed it over to the Nepal Railway Company Limited in June last year. Erstwhile prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly flagged off the railway, which is considered a milestone in cross-border connectivity between the two countries.As Nepal’s only railway company had no trained staff to run the trains, the Indian company, KRCL, agreed to provide the human resources until the Nepali side had necessary staff, including technicians. The Indian company was also ready to train Nepalis. For that, all the Nepali side needed to do was select people and send them for training across the border. But Nepali authorities failed to do even that bare minimum. Eventually, the Indian company wrote to the Nepali side asking either to renew the contract that expires in December or terminate it. As Nepali authorities are still unprepared to run the train, they are planning to extend the contract with the KRCL for another year. The Indian company provides 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks. This is not the first project built with the support of a friendly country that Nepal has failed to run properly. In the 1970s, China built a 13-kilometre trolley bus route where buses operated through overhead electric cables from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur. Within years of China handing over the mass transit project, it started facing one after another managerial problems. Eventually, the project collapsed and the Nepal government closed it in 2009. The case of the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway will inspire no trust among either India or China, the two neighbours, both of whom supposedly want to boost rail connectivity with Nepal. The Indian side has been working to develop a cross-border Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line. The Indian company KRCL last year submitted its location survey report for the proposed line. Similarly, a China-Nepal cross-border railway project connecting Chinese city Kerung and Nepal’s capital Kathmandu has long been a stuff of Nepali dreams.For a relatively poor country like Nepal, there is no alternative to taking support from other countries to develop big projects. But such ventures should be taken as opportunities for both technology and skill transfer. Yet that is apparently not how the authorities in Kathmandu see things. If the country can’t build certain projects on its own, it should at least have a clear vision and a plan on how to run the ones it accepts from generous donors. If the country continues to be neglectful of the support of its foreign friends, not only will it reflect poorly on Nepal’s standing as a trusted partner. It will also show that the country is uninterested in learning from its friends abroad and in time developing its own capabilities to run vital projects and ventures. If Nepal cannot help itself, it is useless to seek outside help.  \nNo matter what happens in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) women’s championship at the Dashrath Rangasala today, Nepali football has already won. The script could have gone badly wrong last Sunday, when Nepal faced India in a heated semi-final. Tempers flared, and Nepali players at one point appeared ready to forfeit the match, the consequences be damned. But better sense prevailed, they took to the field again, and then went on to register one of the most memorable victories in the annals of Nepali sports. What was impressive was not just the spectacular victory of our women’s national team against India, the five-time champions, 4-2 on penalties, but also their manifest sportsmanship despite being at the end of some very iffy refereeing decisions.India has always been a formidable team, and this was only the second time our ladies had defeated the southern juggernaut. Although India must have anticipated a competitive match after their 1-0 defeat to Nepal in the tournament’s last edition, surely, they couldn’t have foreseen such a massive turnout of Nepali supporters eager to witness their women players take the field. This, combined with Nepal’s compact defence holding strong despite being down to 10 players, left the Indians formless after the second-half pause, which lasted over an hour following Preeti Kulung Rai’s disallowed equaliser to India’s Sangita Basfore’s 30-yard goal.The umpiring team’s decision to rule out Nepal’s goal following the referee’s restart while the Indians were celebrating Basfore’s strike sparked widespread criticism. The Nepali team had the right to protest; a goal cannot be disallowed after the referee restarts a match. The enraged crowd threw bottles and shouted, “Referee out,” alerting the security personnel in the overflowing stadium. In time, things calmed down and the Nepali women decided to fight back. The star players were Sabitra Bhandari, “Samba,” who scored the equalising goal as well as a penalty kick, and Anjana Rana Magar, the keeper who saved two penalties. The resilience and determination the national women’s team showed on the field touched every Nepali. Yes, the times are changing, and female players are finally getting the appreciation they deserve. However, the country should aim higher. The monthly salary for the women’s team is only around 30,000 per player as of August 2024. Nor do women get many chances to play domestically. Given the inability to earn in Nepal, many players go abroad in search of better opportunities. Likewise, while male footballers are busy playing several national-level leagues around the year, women’s leagues rarely take place and are poorly managed. In terms of prize money, men are usually rewarded with huge cash prizes, whereas the amounts are substantially less for women. Samba, the all-time highest-scoring footballer in Nepal and the only Nepali to play and score in a European league, was discovered by a National team referee in her home district’s women’s football tournament when she was 16. Other female footballers have similar stories. So having more grassroots leagues and tournaments that bring out hidden talents is vital to encourage women. Now, all eyes will be on our ladies who face Bangladesh in the finals today. The absence of Rekha Poudel, Samba’s attacking partner, will be felt as Bangladesh is a strong opponent we failed to defeat last time. But again, win or lose, the Nepali women’s fortitude and sportsmanship displayed last Sunday have already won the hearts of millions of Nepali football fans. They will be happy today so long as the Nepali team gives its 100 percent.  \nThe centrality of provinces in the healthy functioning of federal Nepal cannot be emphasised enough. Nearly a decade after Nepal’s embrace of federalism, the country’s provincial governments remain in a state of limbo. This has not only tarnished their image in the eyes of the general public but cast doubt on their very existence. People from different walks of life are calling for ditching the provinces altogether. But amid these calls, it is once again worth asking what has rendered the provinces ineffective. A small example from Karnali Province exemplifies the hurdles that provinces face. In 2019, the province came up with the idea of having an integrated administrative building to enhance its service delivery. But the project couldn’t get off the ground as the federal Ministry of Urban Planning never permitted the province to use the land at the proposed site. This case speaks volumes about the federal-provincial divide: If a province has to beg with the federal government for years to put up a building, what are its chances of getting more substantive rights and resources?The centralised approach is also evident in the federal level’s hesitation to adjust the police force at the provincial level. The federal government hasn’t even implemented the Police Personnel Adjustment Act endorsed by the federal parliament in 2019. The oversight extends to other critical areas like the passage of the Federal Civil Service Act. For example, the provinces demand that chief district officers function under provincial governments. Having their own police force and civil servants would have greatly helped with the functioning of the provincial governments—yet the leaders at the centre seem intent on blocking this all-important reform. Provinces also face obstacles in establishing autonomous institutions and managing resources locally, such as collecting fines and penalties in the transport sector. Such financial restriction adds to the burden provinces already face due to the 26 percent reduction in fiscal equalisation grants for the provinces, as we saw in this fiscal year. This in turn makes provinces dependent on the federal government for financial sources—which is apparently what their federal overlords want. What’s more, even the conditional grants they get are aligned to federal priorities rather than their own. These bottlenecks have severely limited the provincial governments’ initiatives and made it nearly impossible for them to respond effectively to their unique needs.The constitution of Nepal guarantees rights and powers to all three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local. Yet the federal government is reluctant to grant provinces their deserved rights, undermining decentralisation. In response, these provincial governments have repeatedly demanded that their voices be heard. Last month, the Koshi provincial government submitted a 10-point appeal to the National Development Action Committee, which is chaired by the prime minister, to heed their concerns on police adjustments to provinces. This is something positive, as it will build pressure on the federal authorities. All seven provinces should unite to make more efforts to hold the federal government accountable to the provinces’ needs.The sorry state of our provinces shows our federal authorities are uninterested in devolving power to provinces and in equal development across the country. This is a deceit as it goes against the spirit of federalism. If the public grievances against the provincial governments continue, it might embolden demands to abandon federalism altogether. Federalism in Nepal will thrive only if the leaders in Kathmandu abandon their centralised mindset and commit, above all, to empowering the provinces—the indispensable middle tier between the federal government and the local units.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe country will experience partly to generally cloudy skies in the hilly areas on Monday, while the rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mostly clear.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli is known for his supposed ability to implement decisions and accomplish the tasks he takes up even at the cost of becoming unpopular.But a series of events after he became prime minister in mid-July tells a different story.In the three and half months since he assumed office at Singha Durbar, the prime minister has been compelled to backtrack on a couple of his plans or postpone them.In the first week of September, Prime Minister Oli pushed a plan to remove Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from the post and elect a lawmaker from the ruling Nepali Congress in her place. According to multiple leaders privy to the development, by electing a Congress lawmaker as deputy speaker, Oli wanted to strengthen relations with the major coalition partner Congress, which has more seats than the prime minister’s party, the CPN-UML, in the House of Representatives. Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba has a special interest in getting a lawmaker from his party elected to the post, as deputy speaker is an ex-officio member of the Constitutional Council, which nominates members and heads of constitutional bodies.The prime minister on September 9 convened a meeting of the ruling parties and floated a proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar and sought a green signal from the coalition partners to his plan.After the meeting, party leaders told the Post that Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office. Deputy Speaker Magar courted controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role. On February 26 last year, Magar wrote to the US Embassy in Kathmandu requesting a visa interview for herself and five others. Two months later, the letter was leaked, and she was under pressure to step down.Last month, the prime minister held several meetings and consultations with a plan to introduce an ordinance to amend the Political Parties Act-2017 with an intention to facilitate party splits. This plan also drew widespread criticism as leaders from various political parties and independent observers accused the prime minister of plotting splits of fringe political parties with a plan to merge their dissident groups into the UML.His proposal to introduce ordinance was reportedly floated in order to merge the Ashok-Rai led Janata Socialist Party and the dissident group from the Madhav Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), which in turn would make the UML the largest party in the House of Representatives.As the major coalition partner, the Congress, reportedly did not back his proposal to introduce the ordinance, Oli was again pushed to the back seat.These are just a few cases in point. Oli from the start of this tenure has struggled to assert his authority.Professor of political science Krishna Pokharel assesses that there may have been an understanding between Congress President Deuba and Prime Minister Oli to arrest Rastriya Swatantra Party President Rabi Lamichhane, who was accused of misappropriating cooperative funds, and issuing an ordinance related to political parties.Pokharel believes that the two leaders might have reached a deal to accomplish the two goals—bring an ordinance to facilitate the split of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which was formed in 2021 after breaking away from the UML; and arrest Lamichhane. Lamichhane, the immediate past home minister, had reportedly tried to arrest Congress chief Deuba’s spouse (current foreign minister) Arzu Rana Deuba, on charges of involvement in the Bhutanese refugee scam. “While the wish of the Congress chief was fulfilled, the interest of the UML chair and the prime minister was not,” Pokharel said. However, the UML leaders don’t buy this argument. Vice-chair Yubaraj Gyawali said that the government under UML leadership has just completed its 100 days, so it is too early to judge its performance. “There are many good initiatives taken by this government whose results will come in due course,” Gyawali told the Post. “Everything that the head of the government wants cannot be achieved in such a short period, but that does not mean his influence has waned.” But some political analysts say that Oli’s standing has declined since he became prime minister this time with the support of Congress, the largest party in Parliament. Oli dismisses those who claim his influence has gone down. While addressing the symposium on ‘Role of former security personnel in National Security and Development’ organised by the Nepal National Former Army and Police Association on October 27, Oli rubbished claims that his influence was steadily decreasing.“Those who claim my charm has decreased will know the reality in the 2027 election,” Oli said.Sarita Bhusal, a UML lawmaker, said a mistaken impression might have been created among the people. “Sometimes there are constraints to leading a coalition government,” Bhusal told the Post.Gyawali, a vice chair of the UML, agrees. “Earlier, Oli became prime minister with the support of smaller parties. But this time, he has the backing of the largest party in Parliament, so it is not easy for him to do all that he wants.” Oli first headed a coalition government after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. When he became prime minister again in 2018 after the 2017 election, his party was the largest in the House. He became prime minister with the support of the Maoist Centre, which was his coalition partner during his previous stint as well.The Congress publicity department head, Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, said his party has been giving full support to the Oli government. “Our party has not opposed any government programme that is good for the country,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “We only caution the government on issues that may cause public backlash.”This government was formed in the spirit of a seven-point agreement between the two parties, and achieving those objectives must be its primary focus, Bishawakarma said. Of late, Oli has also faced criticism from within his party. Some UML leaders publicly opposed his recent decision to accept a donation from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of Bhatbhateni Supermarket, for the construction of the party’s head office. Experts see it as a sign of his decreasing hold in the party organisation. Although party’s standing committee member Binda Pandey and central committee member Ushakiran Timilsina protested against it publicly, other party leaders are also reportedly dissatisfied with Oli’s decision.Bhim Rawal, who contested the election for chair against Oli during the party’s 10th general convention in Chitwan in November 2021, also criticised Oli for accepting the donation. Sidelined by Oli, Rawal is currently inactive in the party. Even leaders like Gokul Baskota, who used to be a staunch Oli supporter, couldn’t back him on the deal with businessman Gurung.In an interview with Image television, Baskota said, “The UML cannot accept Gurung’s donation and carry his old baggage.” On October 28, the Supreme Court issued an interlocutory interim order barring the ruling party, UML, from building any structure on the land donated by businessman Gurung. A single bench of Justice Sunil Kumar Pokharel said the UML-Gurung donation deal was illegal prima facie, putting Oli further on the defensive. \nThe construction of a concrete bridge over the Babai river near Ghuinyabari in Kalimati Rural Municipality-7 has faced significant delays, with only 70 percent of the work completed after seven years. The project, initially contracted to be completed within three years, has suffered due to various issues, including a lack of initial effort from the contractor.The contract for the bridge was signed in 2017, with a three-year completion target. However, despite multiple deadline extensions, only one out of the three spans has been completed to date. The water level in the Babai river remains high during monsoon seasons, further hindering progress, and it appears unlikely that the bridge will be finished this year.The federal government allocated a budget of Rs450 million for the project in 2017, dedicating Rs160 million to construct the bridge near Ghuinyabari. The contract was awarded to Rasuwa Elite JV by the Mid and Far-Western Sector No. 3 Nepalgunj office, with construction starting in June 2017. The 180-metre-long bridge, comprising five pillars, was planned for completion by 2020.Despite the contractor’s commitment to completing the project within three years, work has now extended to seven years, with only 70 percent completed due to delays during the rainy season. Local resident Karna Bahadur Rana reported that initial contractors did little to advance the work. Although recent contractors have made some progress, it remains insufficient to meet the project’s objectives.Mitra Lal Rijal, chair of ward 7 in Kalimati Rural Municipality, attributed the delays to initial inactivity by the contractor. He explained that the project was postponed for nearly three years due to contractor negligence, with work resuming last year under pressure from various stakeholders. However, the contractor has yet to accelerate the project to completion.In addition to the bridge, the government aims to connect the Salyan Khalanga-Kalimati-Damdawali-Ghuinyabari-Chapargauri-Nepalgunj road. However, delays in the bridge project have hindered progress, and until the road is fully connected, the bridge will not fulfil its intended purpose.Kalimati Rural Municipality Chair Dan Bahadur Khatri added that, due to unresolved issues in the Nikunj area, approximately 15 km of road construction remains. Although Rs400 million was allocated for road construction in this area, progress was stalled by environmental restrictions. Consequently, the authorities plan to upgrade the road section in Kalimati.Rasuwa Elite JV supervisor Mahesh Gautam said that initial delays were caused by challenges in excavating for pillars, as large underground rocks obstructed foundation work. \nThe 220kV Chilime-Trishuli transmission line project has been completed after seven years of construction. This crucial development in the energy sector is expected to open the doors to electricity trade with China. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line links two locations: Chilime, a small village close to the Chinese border in the north of Kathmandu in Rasuwa district, and Trishuli, a smaller town in Nuwakot district. According to the Nepal Electricity Authority, this transmission line project is extremely important for Nepal because it will benefit electricity producers and facilitate power trading with the northern neighbour, China.Kulman Ghising, managing director of the Nepal Electricity Authority, said in a statement issued on Monday, \"The Chilime-Kerung international transmission line will be built for electricity trade with China, the neighbouring country to the north. The Chilime-Trishuli transmission line will serve as a link to China.”During the then prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s visit to China in September last year, the two sides signed an agreement to develop the Nepal section of the proposed 220kV Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime cross-border transmission line with a Chinese grant.“The two sides will launch the construction of the Jilong/Kerung-Rasuwagadhi-Chilime 220kV cross-border power transmission line at an early date,” according to the joint statement issued during the visit.The two sides agreed to build the first transmission line connecting the two neighbours. Currently, without grid connectivity with China, Nepal relies solely on India for importing electricity during the dry season and exports its surplus power during the wet season.Around a dozen cross-border transmission lines are already in operation, including one with 400kV capacity to India, while four other 400kV cross-border grids extending southwards are in the pipeline.According to the NEA officials, the Nepal section is 16 km from the China border to the Chilime hub, while the Chinese will need to construct around 80 km from its side to the border.This project is designed to evacuate electricity generated from the Trishuli River basin, marking a significant milestone in Nepal's energy infrastructure.This is the key power evacuation project that would benefit the projects, including the 216MW Upper Trishuli-1, 60MW Upper Trishuli 3A, and the 36MW Upper Trishuli 3B hydroelectric projects. The transmission line would also evacuate power from the 14.6MW Upper Sanjen, 42.5MW Sanjen, 111MW Rasuwagadhi, 14.3MW Upper Mailung, and 5MW Upper Mailung A hydroelectric projects.The 28 km Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double circuit electricity transmission line has 76 pylons. “The facility would evacuate power from the 111MW Rasuwagadhi Hydropower Project and 42.5MW Sanjen Hydropower Project, both built under the authority's subsidiary company, Chilime Jalvidyut,” said Ghising, adding that the Rasuwagadhi and Sanjen projects have been completed and are in the power generation stage.“This transmission line will also help many other hydropower projects under construction in the area.”\"Erecting a pylon was challenging in many areas. The mountainous terrain meant many places did not have roads, so people or mules had to carry conduction materials like stones, sand, water and pylon parts. Additionally, floods and landslides, forest clearance, local obstacles and Covid-19 also created hurdles,” said Ghising. According to the NEA, 33 pylons had to be constructed in places without access roads.“Despite all odds, we have completed the project through our continuous efforts,” said Ghising.Tharka Bahadur Thapa, chief of the grid operation department of the NEA, said the project built more than 20 kilometres of access roads.He said that nine pylons were constructed by transporting construction materials and equipment by mules and people, while two were built by transporting construction materials by helicopter. In most mountain areas, drones were used to connect the overhead line cables from one pylon to another. The 65 million euro (approximately Rs9.49 billion as per Monday’s exchange rate) project was jointly financed by the German government through its Development Bank KfW (grant of 14 million euro), European Investment Bank (loan of 25 million euro), the European Union under its Asia Investment Facility (2.25 million euro) and the rest by Nepal government.In October 2017, Chinese firm Pinggao Group of Companies was awarded the contract to build the transmission line and substation. The transmission line project includes the construction of the 220/132 kV Trishuli 3B hub substation, the 220/132 kV Chilime substation, and the Chilime-Trishuli 220 kV double-circuit transmission line.The transmission line has been constructed at elevations ranging from 680 to 2,600 metres above sea level.  \nPolice detained seven protestors after the clash with Rabi Lamichhane-led Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) cadres in Pokhara on Tuesday afternoon.Tensions rose in Pokhara as a protest in support of RSP chair Rabi Lamichhane, currently under police custody for investigation on charges of cooperative fraud and organised crime, led to a confrontation with the police.The police used tear gas when protesters attempted to breach a restricted area. In the ensuing clash, seven protestors were detained, according to police sources.RSP activists began their protest ahead of Lamichhane’s scheduled court appearance for an extension of his custody at Kaski District Court. The clash occurred when the activists, who were heading towards Y Chowk, were intercepted by the police at Ratna Chowk.On Tuesday, Lamichhane was brought before the Kaski District Court for a remand extension before Judge Chandrakanta Paudel. Former Deputy Inspector General and Gorkha Media Network co-director Chhabilal Joshi was also presented.Joshi has been held since September 22, while Lamichhane was detained on October 18 from the RSP central office and transferred to Kaski. The court initially granted six days of custody, later extended by seven more days. Due to the Tihar holiday, Lamichhane appeared before the court on Tuesday after his remand expired on October 30.In connection with the Suryadarshan Cooperative fraud case, suspects Leela Pachhai and Ram Bahadur Khanal also faced remand extension requests. Authorities discovered an unauthorised transfer of Rs 30 million from the cooperative to Pachhai’s account.Khanal, 48, a Tanahun native and shareholder in the Gorkha Group of Companies Limited, was detained by a Central Investigation Bureau team on October 25 in Kathmandu. He also owns Nature Herbs International.The police are preparing to take former deputy prime minister and home minister Rabi Lamichhane to Butwal for an investigation into allegations of cooperative fraud and organised crime. \nLight to moderate rainfall that occurred briefly on Sunday and again on Monday brought a chill to the Kathmandu Valley and several parts of the country. The Meteorological Forecasting Division under the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology said light to moderate rainfall is expected on Tuesday as well in most of the hilly and mountainous regions.“Light to moderate rainfall has occurred in hilly and mountainous areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki Provinces and some places of Karnali and Sudurpaschim Provinces have also witnessed rainfall on Monday,” said Pratibha Manandhar, a senior meteorologist at the Meteorological Forecasting Division. “Some places of Tarai region of Lumbini Province also witnessed rainfall. Temperature will decline further in the coming days as rainfall will bring chilly weather.”The Met Office attributes the rainfall and weather disturbances to westerly winds, local weather systems and effects of low pressure areas formed around West Bengal of India. There are chances of light snowfall in a few places of the high hilly and mountainous region of the country on Sunday night, according to the Met Office. Hilly areas of the country will witness general to partly cloudy conditions and the rest of the places will witness partial cloudy conditions.“We will see sunlight on Wednesday,” said Manandhar. “Weather will improve Wednesday onwards.”According to met Office, Kathmandu Valley recorded 6.1 mm rainfall in 4 hours on Monday. Minimum temperature of the Valley recorded 16.2 degree Celsius. Many people including office goers were soaked and those returning to Kathmandu Valley and in other destinations across the country after celebrating Tihar were affected due to disturbances in domestic flights. Farmers preparing to harvest rice, millet and other crops have also been affected due to rain.Meanwhile the rainfall has helped reduce air pollution in many places including the capital city, which had worsened of late.Nepal is one of the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that Nepal's maximum temperature is rising at a greater rate (0.056 degrees Celsius per year) than the global average of 0.03 degrees Celsius per year.Experts say extreme weather events—excess rainfall in a short period, continuous rains for several days after the monsoon, dry spells, droughts, below-average precipitation, and above-normal winter temperatures—have become more frequent in Nepal.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising faster, at 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the annual global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius. \nLow-quality goods and price manipulation are rampant in Nepali markets. Are the milk and butter we are buying fresh? What about rice, lentils, noodles and other goods in groceries? And are we being sold fake sneakers and jeans slapped with the labels of popular brands? Also, who among us has not been frustrated when we order one thing online and something completely different arrives? It’s frustrating. But there is hope on the horizon. Starting December, the government plans to establish a consumer court in Kathmandu to hear the consumers’ grievances and complaints against unethical market practices. The court is finally coming into being, nearly three years after a Supreme Court directive. Consumer protection in Nepal has for long been overlooked. The Consumer Protection Act 2018 did mandate the establishment of consumer courts, but there were significant delays in its implementation. This in turn emboldened unscrupulous traders and led to the proliferation of their businesses. Meanwhile, Nepali consumers, long used to getting shoddy deals, have long since stopped complaining. But the new court will allow them to resolve even minor issues quickly and effectively within a specialised setting guided by judges who are experts in consumer law. Consumers only need a bill of goods and services to file a case and they will not have to wait long for a hearing.But there is also bad news. This service is only limited to the federal capital, Kathmandu, which will initially hear cases from Lalitpur, Kathmandu and Bhaktapur. Plans are underway for an extension to other districts and provinces, but officials fear lack of adequate budget and bureaucratic hurdles may hinder such an expansion. Some local units have acted against malpractices and punished businesspersons who cheat on customers, but these initiatives are insufficient. What we really need is a nationwide network of consumer courts. Last fiscal year alone, the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control filed 178 cases in the District Administration Office, Kathmandu. These cases were related to processed drinking water, food items, lentils, sweet items, oil and ghee, milk and dairy items, and spices. The department recorded many cases of substandard products produced by major brands like Bhat-Bhateni food products, Dabur Nepal, CG Oil and Derivatives and Pokhara Noodles. These businesses were found to be flouting Nepal’s consumer laws and compromising people’s health. Consumer protection provisions were thus due. Now that the country is embarking on the journey of establishing consumer courts, there should be no further delays. Expansion of the courts beyond the confines of Kathmandu Valley should not be a big problem too. We hear of large chunks of budgets of all three levels of government in Nepal going unspent every single year. What better way to spend the money than in ensuring that people get value for their money—at a time unjustified price hikes and selling of fakes is giving them a lot of headache? This is why United Nations Guidelines for Consumer Protection recognise the “access to and availability dispute resolution and redress mechanism as a basic need of consumers”. That is also among people’s basic rights as taxpayers.  \nThe global order is crumbling rapidly. It appears nowhere near the Schumpeterian idea of creative destruction; Jacques Derrida's deconstruction theory, therefore, barely posits the optimism of legendary phoenix-like revival. The global playground of powers is now without a custodian or a referee to stop the ratchet. It is almost axiomatic that the global order is critical to global governance, which is inevitable for global peace and prosperity. In this increasingly interconnected world, societal and national orders are also largely contingent on the global order and the outcome of the geopolitics of the governance, whether good or bad.The imperative of global governance was desperately realised in the 1940s after the two devastating Great Wars. As a result, essentially, the United Nations (UN), World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT, now WTO) and similar other multilateral institutions were established. So far, hundreds of international treaties, conventions and covenants have been drafted and implemented or enforced, at least in theory. However, due to the rapidly widening gap between expectation and (in)effectiveness (or helplessness?), these institutions and instruments, mainly the UN and its agencies, are now being questioned regarding the rationale of their very existence.Without a refereeThe end of the Russia-Ukraine war is nowhere on the horizon. Russian President Vladimir Putin appears to be consolidating his legitimacy through forums like Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa (BRICS). Economic sanctions on Russia by Western countries have had little impact due to the unhindered revenue flow from oil and gas supplied to Europe and Asia. The Gaza crisis is spreading to the entire Arab world and, perhaps, beyond. The foreign policy of the United States on Gaza and Israel seems pressed between its interest in protecting the Israeli state and saving its democratic credentials by stopping inhuman excesses at the Israeli war targets. Digital, communication and transportation technologies, such as artificial intelligence, the Internet and drones, are being used more for destructive purposes, such as starting wars, rather than serve humanity. Trade wars have intensified. The global debt balloon has spiralled out of control, and so has the climate crisis. So, apprehensions abound that we may be on the verge of World War III.Personalities like UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres often cry foul from the fringes, but there are no takers of it. The UN is unable to safeguard its agency, UNWRA (The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East), against the formal Israeli allegations of colluding with the groups that Israel has labelled as 'terrorists'. They are even incapable of admonishing the countries that are blatantly engaged in arms sales and doing nothing tangible to mitigate the potential threat of nuclear war. The leaders of powerful nations on the frontline continue to disregard international laws, rules or norms, sine qua non for maintaining global order and, thereby, ensuring fair global governance.Of course, there is a broader age-old unanswered question surrounding the very design of these institutions, choice of location for their headquarters, personnel selection processes, modus operandi and funding mechanisms. All these aspects were ab initio at the control and mercy of the same group of powerful nations that often choose to flout the so-called international rules and norms. The current international governance mayhem is akin to a game without a referee capable of flagging a foul to powerful global players who are quarrelling rather than respecting the game of rules.Throb of repolarisationThe debate over the shift of the global power poles and the emergence of multipolarity is gaining currency. However, the throb and thong of creating, recognising and sustaining multiple such poles have fiercely gripped the world. The emerging potential poles are keen to build new alliances, while the existing ones exert all efforts not to lose their grip. This has resulted in multifaceted tit-for-tat actions and reactions among the countries through diplomatic rows, strategic bans and fresh trade barriers.Within days after Putin appeared in a triumphant mood regarding his ability to invite leaders from 36 countries for the 16th BRICS Summit in Russia on 22-24 October, the US government on October 30 imposed ‘sanctions on nearly four hundred entities and individuals for enabling Russia’s illegal war against Ukraine.’ This action targets multiple sectors essential to Russia’s war effort.’ This includes the ‘entities and individuals’ from China, India, Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Türkiye, Switzerland, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who continue to sell ‘important dual-use goods to Russia, including critical components that the country relies on for its weapons systems to wage war against Ukraine.’Extracting allegianceThis United States’ move is critical since it involves putative allies and big trade partners like India, Switzerland and the UAE. India is part of ‘the Quad’, the group of four countries (the other three being Australia, Japan and Australia) created out of large ‘democracies’ in the Indo-Pacific region. They had a summit in the last week of September in Washington, DC. The US sanction to 19 Indian entities and two Indian nationals comes at a time when its diplomatic row with Canada, one of the closest US allies, is at its height. Its trade deficit with Russia was $57.14 billion last year against the export of only $4.26 billion. India is among the countries which continued to import Russian oil during the Western sanctions. Nepal is one of the beneficiaries of stable oil prices that are maintained due to this supply. The American move appears to extract unconditional allegiance from India, moving away from Russian engagement. The tug-of-war of creating or breaking alliances is poised to only be nastier in the future.The most alarming and dangerous trait is that the war, financing billions from these rich countries, has been forthcoming and instant. However, humanitarian and development assistance to the developing world has been asymptotic to zero for decades. What’s more, the governments and parliaments of these countries are approving these finances to the parties of their interest at the cost of astronomical debt burden to their treasuries. The IMF estimates that the global public debt will exceed $100 trillion, or about 93 percent of the global gross domestic product, by the end of this year. Only two countries, the US and China, account for 50 percent of it—$36 trillion and 16 trillion, respectively. There is no mechanism to tame them. \nAccording to the United Nations 2024 is “the biggest election year in human history” with half of the world’s population—some 3.7 billion people in 72 countries—able to vote. Yet some elections are more consequential than others which is why the world is watching as the United States goes to the polls.The US is the world’s largest economy, and the biggest military power. But it also the lynchpin of many international strategic alliances, the economic and financial system and many of the world’s liberal institutions.These elections are a pivotal moment in US history which could have massive implications for how the country is governed and for the future of the post-war order that Washington has helped build.Unlike any election since 1945 the basic tenets of US relations with the rest of the world are in contention. The choice is between Donald Trump’s Republican party potentially offering a complete break from the US’s role in the international community, compared to Kamala Harris’s more international agenda under the Democrats. Under Harris, the US is likely to continue to play a significant role in Nato, for instance.Tariffs on ChinaThe most conspicuous assault on the US’s foreign policy tradition is Trump’s plans to impose a universal tariff of 20 percent on all foreign imports. Tariffs on China could be much higher with threats from Trump of 60-200 percent. As well as being inflationary and damaging to the American economy such moves are likely to result in retaliation, trade wars and dislocation with the world economy. By limiting access to the world’s largest national market, they would also hamper global efforts to transition to a zero-carbon economy.Such matters are of little concern to Trump however, who plans to repeat his withdrawal of Washington from the Paris agreement on climate change, to repeal the environmental protection measures implemented by Joe Biden, and to authorise the unrestricted exploitation of US oil and gas deposits through deregulated fracking. Trump’s plans would add tonnes of extra carbon to the atmosphere if executed and would be likely to significantly undermine global work on climate change.Also in contention in the 2024 election is the US commitment to defend its friends and allies from hostile states. As a member of Nato the US is bound to come to the aid of the other members under article 5, if another country attacks them, and it also has similar treaties with Japan and South Korea. The Biden administration led Nato in supporting Ukraine with military and financial aid to prevent its total subjugation to Russian occupation.By contrast Trump has indicated that he would end this support and pressure Kyiv to accept peace on Moscow’s terms. Rather than seeing a network of alliances as the basis of strength and influence, Trump sees these as a source of risk and a burden.Defending friendsMany former officials, such as former national security advisor John Bolton, suspect that Trump would seek to leave Nato in a second term or weaken its effectiveness through tepid support. In Asia, Trump’s recent comments that “Taiwan should pay us for defence. You know, we’re no different than an insurance company” suggest a weakening of US commitment to the island.For many observers these elections also matter because the US’s ability to conduct a free, fair and undisputed election and the peaceful transfer of power is in question. From his first involvement in the Republican party primary process in 2016 Trump has never accepted the results of an election that he lost.What is more remarkable is that he has convinced a majority of Republican voters to side with him in asserting that the 2020 election was stolen, only a third believe the election was legitimate. When faith in the electoral process is so undermined it is difficult to see how the US can come together to be governed after the election.For the Trump camp, however, there is a ready answer for this question. If elected, Project 2025, a document of policies prepared by a right-leaning think tank, suggests that his administration would replace the top tier of Washington’s bureaucracy with 50,000 officials who pledge loyalty to him over the constitution. It also suggests that a Trump administration would disband a myriad of federal agencies such as the departments of justice, energy, and education as well as the FBI and Federal Reserve and to use his newly claimed executive authority to impose his policy agenda.Such measures are designed to enable Trump to introduce a raft of policies that many regard as authoritarian, such as the deportation of millions of “illegal aliens”, using the National Guard and army, if necessary.The US experiment with democracy has fascinated and inspired the world since its inception in 1776. Never before, however, has it seemed in such jeopardy. The US is deeply divided on many fundamental questions, from taxation, immigration, abortion, trade, energy and environmental policy, and its role in the world.For the first time these divisions seem more important to many electors than respect for their democratic institutions and traditions. More fundamentally, many US citizens seem unable to accept the result of the democratic process and the subsequent legitimacy of the winner. Who wins the election and how the US is governed as a result, matters more now, to more people, than ever.—The ConversationRead the original article here. \nFrequent plane crashes, natural disasters, poor infrastructure and bureaucratic challenges—they all ail Nepali tourism. There is a dire need to ramp up efforts to get it on track. But then we as a country are taking a step back when the rest of the world is looking to boost tourism with robust plans and policies. The Civil Aviation Authority’s latest decision to close Tribhuvan International Airport—Nepal’s only ariel gateway for foreign tourists and the sole door of opportunities for millions of its citizens—for 10 hours (10 pm to 8 am) to complete a long-overdue taxiway expansion, has garnered national and international criticism for the strain it will put on the country’s tourism.While there is nothing wrong with the project to renovate taxiways that have worn out from years of use, the authorities perhaps didn’t consider its impact on tourism and passengers seriously. The airport closure from November 8 to March 31 is bound to inconvenience foreign visitors as it coincides with both autumn and spring peak trekking seasons. Festivals, family reunions, holidays and favourable weather make this season the perfect time to travel to Nepal. Such a prolonged halt will only dampen people’s enthusiasm. One is left wondering why such a vital time was chosen for these renovations.The financial repercussions are substantial. The Nepal Tourism Board, which had aimed for 1.3 million tourists this year, has cut down the expected number to 1.1 million. This could lead to a revenue loss of around Rs50 billion for the airline and tourism industry. Indirect cost could be many times higher. International airlines have cut flights or cancelled tickets at short notice, taking airfares to all-time highs. For instance, the most popular destination in November, Sydney, which would have cost Rs85,000 on normal days, will now cost Rs217,000 (for the highest priced tickets) and Rs114,000 (lowest). For average Nepali workers and students, these fares are unaffordable. Tourism entrepreneurs are facing losses as hotels are reporting cancellations.In 2019, for the same project, the airport was closed for seven hours (11:30 pm to 6:30 am) after which 24/7 operations began for the first time to compensate for the lost flight hours. Earlier this year, too, for the very project, landings from the northern side of the airport were barred, but there were no airport closures. Given these precedents, one would have expected more robust planning this time. Instead, it seems there has not been enough homework. The civil aviation authorities’ efforts to manage the Kathmandu airport’s congestion by redirecting traffic to Pokhara and Gautam Buddha international airports have also failed because no foreign airline operator is willing to fly to these destinations. Travel trade entrepreneurs lament that this “unplanned construction” is taking too long and fear it might extend to spring, another peak tourist season. This is understandable given Nepal’s poor record in completing roads and infrastructure. They have also urged the authorities to limit the shutdown to five hours. However, that risks further delaying the project. A balanced approach that prioritises tourism and passengers while ensuring timely completion is the best. The International Air Transport Association’s (IATA) request that the authorities shorten the closure or spare high-traffic days is logical. Halting operations at peak arrival and departure is neither wise nor sustainable. Ultimately, the health of the country’s civil aviation is closely linked to the state of its regulator. Right now, it appears that our top aviation officials are working more for themselves than for the benefit of the intended beneficiaries.  \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli’s secretariat has cancelled all the meetings scheduled for Tuesday citing the poor health of the head of the government.According to the secretariat, the Prime Minister has been experiencing a mild fever since Monday and is, currently, resting at his official residence in Baluwatar.“He developed a fever yesterday,” a secretariat member said. “It is mild at the moment, and he is resting; all of today’s meetings have been called off.” \nFlooding is one of the most common natural disasters around the world as evidenced by the severe flooding that has impacted several countries this year alone.According to World Bank data from 2020, around 1.47 billion people or about 19% of the global population. face significant risks of severe flooding from rivers, heavy rainfall, or coastal erosion, with 89% of those at risk residing in low- to middle-income countries.The majority of those vulnerable to flooding—about 1.36 billion people—live in South and East Asia, with 329 million in China and 225 million in India, making up more than one-third of the world’s flood-prone population.In 2024, nine out of the top 10 countries most at risk of river flooding are in Asia, particularly in the southern and eastern regions of the continent. Southeast Asia, with its low-lying terrain, frequent tropical storms, heavy rains, long monsoon seasons, and underdeveloped flood protection infrastructure, is especially prone to frequent and severe flooding.Climate change is also impacting the frequency and intensity of these events, with an estimated 30% increase in flood-affected populations if global temperatures rise by 2°C.According to Statista’s March 2024 survey on flood risk, based on the approximate number of people affected by annual floods, the risk index ranges from 0 to 10 (higher scores indicate higher risk). The countries with the highest flood risk are Vietnam, Egypt and Bangladesh (risk index 9.9); Thailand (9.8); Iraq (9.6); Pakistan (9.5); China (9.3); India (9.2); Myanmar (8.8); and Cambodia (8.7).Since mid-2024, Thailand has faced intense flooding due to the ongoing rainy season, especially in the northern region, with some parts of the south also affected. Total rainfall from January to August was 5% above the average for this period and the amount of rainfall from August to October is expected to exceed the average, with the central region (including Bangkok) projected to receive 800-900 mm, compared to the normal average of 782 mm, with the northern and central regions experiencing the most severe flooding as the lower northern region serves as a channel directing rainfall toward the sea.The economic impacts are significant, with flooding expected to affect 8.6 million rai (1.38 million hectares) of agricultural land this year, causing property and asset damage of 3.1 billion baht and agricultural production losses worth 43.4 billion baht. The total economic impact could reach 46.5 billion baht, reducing annual GDP by 0.27%.-In Association with ANN \nBoeing’s US West Coast factory workers accepted a new contract offer on Monday, ending a bitter seven-week strike that halted most jet production and deepened a financial crisis at the troubled planemaker.The union said members voted 59% in favour of the new contract, which includes a 38% pay rise spread over four years, easing pressure on new Boeing CEO Kelly Ortberg after two previous offers were voted down in recent weeks.“This is a victory. We can hold our heads high,” Jon Holden the union’s lead negotiator, told members after the results were announced. “Now it’s our job to get back to work.”The end of the first strike in 16 years by Boeing’s largest union provides welcome relief for a company that has lurched from one setback to the next since a door panel blew off a near-new 737 MAX plane in mid-air in January.In a message to Boeing employees after the vote, Ortberg said he was pleased the union had ratified a deal.“While the past few months have been difficult for all of us, we are all part of the same team,” he said. “There is much work ahead to return to the excellence that made Boeing an iconic company.”Around 33,000 machinists who work on the best-selling 737 MAX jet, as well as the 767 and 777 widebodies, have been on strike since September 13, demanding a 40% wage increase and the restoration of a defined-benefit pension they lost a decade ago for a 401(k) retirement plan.“I’m ready to get back to work,” said David Lemon, a worker in equipment calibration certification in Seattle who voted in favour of the contract.He calculated that the pay hike and a 4% bonus - the guaranteed minimum annual payout to the reinstated incentive plan - amounted to the 40% increase they’d gone after. “We got there,” he said.The old pension will not be restored, but workers will receive a bump to company matching contributions for their 401(k) plans.Boeing also promised to build the next aeroplane in the Seattle area. “They’ve never given us a commitment” to a new aeroplane before launch, Holden said.President Joe Biden and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, who facilitated the contract talks, congratulated workers and the company on the outcome. “We’ve shown that collective bargaining works,” Biden said.Boeing said Su was instrumental in moving both sides toward reaching a ratified deal.Biden has been particularly supportive of unions as president, and the union vote comes the day before Americans go to national polls to pick his successor.SLOW RAMP UPBoeing will now take weeks to ramp up plane production and boost cash flow, with 737 MAX output expected to languish in the single digits per month for some time, according to two people briefed on the matter, far short of the 38-a-month targeted before the strike.Workers can start returning to building planes from Wednesday, the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) said, although Boeing has warned that some people will have to be retrained due to the prolonged period away from the factory floor.The strike was costing Boeing around $100 million a day in lost revenue, analysts said, prompting the planemaker to raise $24 billion from investors last week in a bid to preserve its investment-grade credit rating.Ortberg now needs to reset relations with machinists in the Pacific Northwest who have used the strike to vent anger built up over a decade when wages have lagged inflation and the cost of living in the Seattle area has soared.The union has said its members earned just four 1% wage increases over the last eight years.“I’m demoralised, to say the least,” said 777 worker Thomas Amilowski, who voted against the contract. He said the union leadership, which had backed the offer in the first vote that was resoundingly rejected by nearly 95% of members, had a “defeatist mindset.”Holden noted that 59% approval meant “there were those who definitely were not happy with the vote.” But he added that workers can rebuild the relationship with Boeing leadership.Boeing has said the average annual machinists’ pay at the end of the new four-year contract will be $119,309, up from $75,608 previously.The pay increase may add $1.1 billion to Boeing’s wage bill over the four years, while a $12,000 ratification bonus for each union member could result in another $396 million in outflows, according to analysts at Jefferies.More than 26,000 union members voted, putting turnout near 80%. \nAnother 2,500 soldiers arrived in the flood-hit east of Spain on Monday to reinforce efforts to locate bodies and clear debris, as government officials traded blame over how the worst flooding in decades has been handled and as first aid packages were being readied.Public anger is mounting over the disaster that has killed at least 217 people with dozens of others still unaccounted for. Almost all of the deaths occurred in the Valencia region and more than 60 in the suburb of Paiporta.The army sent about 5,000 soldiers over the weekend to help distribute food and water, clean up streets and guard against looters and a further 2,500 would join them, Defence Minister Margarita Robles told state-owned radio RNE.A warship with 104 marine infantry soldiers as well as trucks with food and water arrived in Valencia port even as a strong hailstorm pummelled Barcelona some 300 km (186 miles) to the north.On Monday evening, Spanish minister Felix Bolanos from the Socialist Party said Tuesday’s cabinet would declare some of the worst hit villages by the floods in the regions of Valencia, Andalusia, Castile La Mancha and Catalonia as “severely affected areas” so that they can be entitled to emergency funds.He added that the government would approve on Tuesday a package of relief measures to help people cope with the situation without giving further details.Later, the regional head of Valencia, Carlos Mazon, said that his region would separately hand out each household 6,000 euros ($6,524) and make available at least 200,000 euros to help each town face urgent spending needs.In total, Mazon, of the conservative People’s Party, said the region would request from Spain’s central government a first aid package worth around 31.4 billion euros, including funds to reconstruct key infrastructure.On Monday, airport operator AENA said about 50 flights due to take off from Barcelona’s partially flooded El Prat airport were cancelled or severely delayed, while 17 due to land there were diverted. Some local train services were also cancelled.Rescuers used drones and water pumps to search and clear underground carparks and garages. They also scanned river mouths where currents may have deposited more bodies.“With these drones we can send them inside the garages and have a first visual of what’s going on,” police spokesperson Ricardo Gutierrez said.Opposition politicians accused the left-wing central government of acting too slowly to warn residents and send in rescuers.Mazon on Monday had previously said the Hydrographic Confederation of Jucar (CHJ), which measures the flow of rivers and ravines for the state, had cancelled a planned alert three times.But Madrid said the CHJ does not issue flood risk alerts, which are the responsibility of Spain’s regional governments.Delayed responseLocals criticised late alerts from authorities about the dangers and a perceived delayed response by emergency services.But General Javier Marcos, commander of the army’s emergency response services, said he had ordered 500 soldiers to be deployed within 15 minutes of seeing the flood warning on Tuesday who were able to enter hard-hit areas.“The degree of destruction is so great that mobility is limited,” he said. “It is so complex that it requires two things: discipline and patience.”On Sunday, some residents in Paiporta slung mud at Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez and King Felipe and his wife, Queen Letizia, chanting: “murderers, murderers!”The prime minister was also struck during the protests, Interior Minister Fernando Grande-Marlaska said in an interview on TVE, blaming a handful of extremists for the trouble.“The majority of people gathered are absolutely peaceful people who have lost everything and whose anger we evidently understand,” Grande-Marlaska said.Locals in Paiporta said anger boiled over because they felt authorities were using them for a photo opportunity.They denied that the crowd was full of extremists.Belen, a 50-year-old supermarket cashier who lost both her cars during the flood, said she was angry with both the national and regional governments about how slowly help has arrived.“That’s what hurts us, that they only come here for a photo,” she said. “They’re all the same dog with different collars. They’re all scum.”A protest planned in Valencia on Saturday will call for Mazon to step down.A daily protest in Madrid outside the headquarters of Sanchez’s Socialist party drew more people on Sunday, about 600, due to anger over the floods, according to El Pais newspaper.The anger vented against all sides reflects a general disillusionment with the political class, analysts at Eurointelligence wrote in a note on Monday. “If the aftermath turns into a big finger-pointing exercise, it will probably deepen that anti-politics sentiment,” it said.Lack of clarity over the numbers of dead and missing has added to frustration. A landline has been set up for relatives to report the missing, with the government saying “dozens and dozens” are still unaccounted for.Coroner services on Monday said 190 autopsies had been performed, and 111 people identified.The midweek torrential rains caused rivers to swell, engulfing streets and ground floors of buildings, and sweeping away cars and masonry in tides of mud.Sonia Luque, coordinator of the Network of Road Assistance Companies (REAC), said more than 100,000 cars were damaged.It was the worst flood-related disaster in Europe in five decades. Scientists say extreme weather is more frequent due to climate change. Meteorologists think the warming of the Mediterranean, which increases water evaporation, plays a key role in making torrential rains more severe. \nA selection committee led by Speaker Devraj Ghimire has recommended Suresh Acharya for the position of Chief Information Commissioner of the National Information Commission.Likewise, Gagan Bista and Durga Bhandari have been recommended as commissioners.The committee, which includes the Minister for Communications and Information Technology and the chair of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, finalised the recommendations on Monday and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications.Acharya is the former chair of the Federation of Nepali Journalists, while Bista, former chair of Press Chautari Nepal, serves as secretary of the UML’s publicity department.Bhandari, with a background in law, previously served as a member of the Nepal Press Council. They will be appointed following a decision by the Council of Ministers. \nDonald Trump and Kamala Harris both predicted victory as they campaigned across Pennsylvania on Monday in the final, frantic day of an exceptionally close US presidential election.The campaign has seen head-spinning twists: two assassination attempts and a felony conviction for Republican former President Trump, and Democratic Vice President Harris’ surprise elevation to the top of the ticket after President Joe Biden, 81, dropped his reelection bid under pressure from his own party. More than $2.6 billion has been spent to sway voters’ minds since March, according to AdImpact, an analytics firm.Nevertheless, opinion polls show Trump, 78, and Harris, 60, in a dead heat. The winner may not be known for days after Tuesday’s vote, though Trump has already signaled that he will attempt to fight any defeat, as he did in 2020.Both candidates converged on Pennsylvania on Tuesday to urge supporters who have not yet cast their ballots to show up on Election Day. The state offers the largest share of votes in the Electoral College of any of the seven battleground states expected to determine the outcome.“With this election, you can show them once and for all that this nation does not belong to them. It belongs to you,” a weary-sounding Trump told a half-full arena in Reading, the second of four stops he had planned for the day. “Together we will fight, fight and we will win, win.”In Allentown, Harris predicted victory and promised to be a president for “all Americans,” as she appealed to the city’s substantial Puerto Rican community who were outraged by insults from a comedian at a Trump rally last week.“Do we believe in the promise of America, and are you ready to fight for it?” she asked the crowd. “Because when we fight, we win.”Both campaigns projected optimism.Harris’ campaign team said its volunteers knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in each of the battleground states this weekend.The campaign says its internal data shows that undecided voters are breaking in their favor, and says it has seen an increase in early voting among core parts of its coalition, including young voters and voters of color.Tom Bonier, head of the Democratic analytics firm TargetSmart, said the early vote showed high enthusiasm among Democratic-leaning groups, especially women. He said there was no indication of a similar surge among young men, a key target of the Trump campaign’s outreach.GENDER GAPTrump campaign officials said they were monitoring early-voting results that show more women have voted than men. That is significant given that Harris led Trump by 50% to 38% among female registered voters, according to an October Reuters/Ipsos poll, while Trump led among men 48% to 41%.“Men must vote!” the world’s richest person Elon Musk, a prominent Trump supporter, wrote on his X social media platform.Trump’s campaign has outsourced most of the voter outreach work to outside groups, including one run by Musk, which have focused on contacting supporters who do not reliably participate in elections, rather than undecided voters.A Pennsylvania judge ruled that Musk could continue his $1 million voter giveaway in the state, which a local prosecutor said amounted to an illegal lottery.Trump has vowed to protect women “whether the women like it or not” and said that the decision of whether to ban abortion should be up to individual states, after the conservative majority he cemented on the US Supreme Court in 2022 ended the nationwide right to abortion. In Reading, he vowed to keep transgender athletes out of women’s sports, as supporters waved pink “Women for Trump” signs behind him.One Trump campaign official said they thought the Republican would carry North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona, which would still require him to carry one of battleground states in the Rust Belt — Michigan, Wisconsin or Pennsylvania — to win the White House. Republicans also appeared to be posting strong early-vote results in Nevada, and have been heartened by robust early-voting numbers in the hurricane-ravaged western counties of North Carolina.“The numbers show that President Trump is going to win this race,” senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters. “We feel very good about where things are.”FALSE FRAUD CLAIMSTrump and his allies, who falsely claim his 2020 defeat was the result of fraud, have spent months laying the groundwork to again challenge the result if he loses. He has promised “retribution” if elected, spoken of prosecuting his political rivals and described Democrats as the “enemy from within.”Harris campaign officials said his attempts to allege fraud will fail. “Voters select the president, not Donald Trump,” Dana Remus, a campaign legal adviser, told reporters.Arizona’s top election official said an online video alleging that Republicans were being removed from voter rolls was false.Trump is due to campaign later in Pittsburgh and Grand Rapids, Michigan. He then plans to return to Palm Beach, Florida, to vote and await election results.Harris is due to campaign in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia, where she will end the day with a rally in front of the Philadelphia Museum of Art, which will feature Lady Gaga, Ricky Martin and Oprah Winfrey.She is expected to spend election night at Howard University in Washington, a historically Black college that is her alma mater. \nOn Tuesday, Koshi Province and the hilly regions will experience partly to generally cloudy skies, with the rest of the country expected to be partly cloudy to mainly fair.Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is likely in a few areas of Koshi Province and at isolated locations in the hilly areas of Bagmati and Sudurpaschim provinces. Rain and thunderstorms are also possible in isolated hilly areas across other provinces.Tonight, partly cloudy skies are expected in the hilly regions, while other areas will remain partly cloudy to mainly fair. Light rain with thunder and lightning may occur in isolated areas of the hilly regions in Bagmati and Gandaki provinces.The Meteorological Forecasting Division attributed these conditions to the influence of westerly and local winds across the country. \nTravellers on international airlines will soon benefit from higher compensation limits. The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) announced that the Montreal Convention liability limits for death, injury, delays, baggage, and cargo issues will increase on December 28, 2024. Nepal implemented the Montreal Convention for the first time on December 15, 2018. Millions of air passengers worldwide are entitled to compensation for yearly flight delays, cancellations, and overbooking. Because passengers are unaware of their rights and airlines make it so hard to get their money, less than 2 percent receive their flight compensation, according to a study. Here is what you need to know about the Montreal Convention and your air passenger rights. Claim what you owe.What is the Montreal Convention 1999 or MC99?The Montreal Convention is a multilateral treaty adopted by a diplomatic meeting of International Civil Aviation Organisation member states in 1999. Ratified in 1999 and enacted in 2003, the Montreal Convention was a successor to the Warsaw Convention 1929.Formally known as the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules for International Carriage by Air, the Montreal Convention 1999 (or MC99) has established a comprehensive and unified framework for the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air. It introduced several elements to balance the interests of travellers, cargo shippers, and the aviation industry. The Convention sets liability limits for airlines, ensuring fair compensation for consumers in cases of injury, death, delay, baggage and cargo issues. ICAO has informed the 140 State Parties that the limits will increase in line with the Convention’s built-in review mechanism, which adjusts for inflation every five years. This ensures that passenger and cargo compensation remains appropriate over time. This is the fourth review since the treaty came into force in 2003. \"ICAO continues to advocate for the universal ratification of MC99,\" said Juan Carlos Salazar, the ICAO secretary general, in a statement. \"This Convention is fundamental in protecting consumer interests in international air travel. By promoting harmonisation and codification of rules governing international carriage by air, MC99 benefits passengers and cargo shippers while enabling the unified and equitable development of air services.\"What are the liability provisions?The liability limits are indicated in Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), a unit of account defined by the International Monetary Fund. For indicative purposes, 1 SDR has been valued at US$ 1.33318 on October 18, 2024. What are the revisions? The limits will be revised as follows: 1. The death or bodily injury limit will increase from 128,821 SDRs to 151,880 SDRs (about US$202,500). It originally was 100,000 SDRs in 2003. 2. The limit for passenger transport delays will rise from 5,346 SDRs to 6,303 SDRs (about US$8,400). 3. The limit for baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay will increase from 1,288 SDRs to 1,519 SDRs (about US$2,000). 4. The limit for cargo destruction, loss, damage, or delay will rise from 22 SDRs to 26 SDRs per kilogram (about US$35). ICAO has invited the States Parties to MC99 to make provisions as necessary in accordance with their domestic legal requirements, to give full effect to the revised limits as of December 28, 2024.What’s the case of Nepal?The Montreal Convention allows air passengers on international flights to claim compensation for damages caused by travel disruptions and luggage problems. Since travellers in Nepal are not aware that they can file a compensation claim, many passengers protest at the airport against the delays, cancellations, baggage damages and other issues caused by the airlines' negligence. For example, if the passengers' baggage is damaged, under the rule, passengers can claim up to $2,000 with the particular airline.However, the Montreal Convention waives the airline’s liability in cases where extraordinary circumstances caused the flight disruption. Such cases include adverse weather, Air Traffic congestion and restrictions, lightning strikes, bird strikes, strikes at the airport, medical emergencies, security threats, and political unrest, etc. You can also claim when … ?On November 30 last year, Flight RA229 of the state-owned Nepal Airlines flew two hours before its scheduled departure, leaving 31 passengers stranded at midnight at Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport. The reason for the rushed departure was the flight’s VVIP status. Then-prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal was on the same flight. The flight was planned for Dahal, who left for Dubai leading the Nepali delegation to the 28th Conference of Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP 28). According to experts, the case is severe negligence by the airline company, and passengers can still file compensation cases as per the Convention.The MC99 extends a time frame within which a passenger can claim compensation for damages – up to two years following the occurrence of the flight disruption. If the claim pertains to damaged, lost, or delayed luggage, it's imperative to report the issue expeditiously. Claims for damaged baggage should be filed within seven days, while claims for delayed baggage must be initiated within 21 days. If your bags remain unclaimed for more than 21 days and are considered lost, you still can file a claim within two years.Where to file the claims?According to Vijay Shrestha, vice-president of administration at Himalaya Airlines, passengers can file a compensation claim by filling out a “property irregularity form” at the airline office or the airline’s ground handling agent in any destination airport.Luggage will be categorised as lost if the airline cannot trace it for 21 days from filing the property irregularity report. All claims shall be substantiated with an itemised list of contents, description, age, and proof of purchase or ownership of all items. At Kathmandu airport, passengers can file compensation claims for loss, delay, or damage at the lost and found unit of Nepal Airlines. “The compensation provision used to be printed on tickets, but since airlines issue e-tickets nowadays, passengers can go to the ‘contract of carriage by air’ on the airline's website to know the information regarding the loss, delay, or damage,” said Shrestha. Is MC99 applicable to domestic airlines? The MC99 makes only international airlines liable in case of passenger death or injury.A year after Nepal adopted the MC99, preparations for adopting a similar law started but could not proceed, although the draft had been prepared.Tourism ministry officials say the process was stalled multiple times as governments changed. Since 2019, there have been six fatal plane and helicopter crashes that killed 130 people, and all the families of the victims have been barred from a justifiable compensation that would be $100,000 as per the proposed provisions.The air carriers’ liability and insurance draft bill for domestic airlines has been sent to the finance ministries for their comments before being tabled by the Cabinet. After the Cabinet nod, the bill will be tabled in Parliament.What’s the provision in the proposed domestic law? As per the planned law, domestic airlines have to pay a minimum compensation of $100,000 for the injury or death of a passenger. Currently, the minimum compensation for passenger death on a domestic flight is $20,000.According to the proposed law, a compensation claim should be filed with the airline or its agents within 60 days of the incident or accident. The carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost and damaged shall be $20 per kg if the damage was caused or contributed to by the negligence of the airlines, it says. The cargo damage is limited up to $5,000.The compensation for the hand baggage, if lost or damaged, shall be $400.Under the Montreal Convention 1999, effective as of December 28, 2019, a carrier’s liability limitation for cargo lost, damaged or delayed shall be 22 SDRs per kg ($29.21 per kg) in the case of destruction, loss, damage or delay concerning cargo carriage.Carriers must pay 1,288 SDRs ($1,709.90) for each passenger in case of baggage destruction, loss, damage, or delay.Likewise, 5,346 SDRs ($7,097.16) should be compensated for each passenger in relation to damage caused by delay in the carriage of persons. \nDuring Dashain, the Bhandari family from Kathmandu gathered at their ancestral home in the east Nepal town of Damak in Jhapa district. Amid the festive atmosphere, Matrika Bhandari sat on the terrace with his five-year-old son, Soham. Soham tugged at his father’s sleeve, eager to show him the kites his cousins were flying outside.However, Bhandari’s attention was elsewhere—he was engrossed in his phone, scrolling through TikTok videos.After several failed attempts to get his father’s attention, Soham gave up. He wandered over to a corner of the room, found his tablet, and started playing a game. Later that evening, during dinner, Bhandari complained to his relatives, “I just don’t know what to do with Soham. Children of today can’t live without phones… He’s always glued to his tablet!”Ironically, as he voiced this concern, he was checking a WhatsApp message on his phone. What Bhandari failed to notice was the reflection of his habits in his son’s growing attachment to screens.It’s the time of festivals again, and familiar scenes of families and relatives coming together are playing out. Yet another common sight will be children and teenagers huddled in the living room, their heads bowed over their phones. Conversations will often start with parents and relatives lamenting that children have become ‘addicted’ to their phones—a topic that is sure to come up at almost every Nepali family gathering this festive season.However, what often goes unnoticed is that in many such living room gatherings, it’s not only the younger generation immersed in screens; their parents are just as preoccupied.It’s common to see parents handing their phones to children to keep them entertained or distracted while they focus on work, or playing videos like ‘Baby Shark’ during mealtime to help their kids eat. And the parents are busy with social media.Research says parents’ excessive use of phones influences their children’s screen habits—and this link is often overlooked.This isn’t without consequences. A study published in PubMed found that greater child and parental exposure to electronic media was linked to a smaller expressive vocabulary at age 2 and negatively impacted language development by age 5. Another study involving parents of 421 Estonian children between the ages of 2.5 and 4 years old revealed that parents who spent more time on screens had children who also used screens more frequently. These children exhibited poorer skills in grammar and vocabulary. The study, which was published in the journal ‘Frontiers’, emphasises the importance of parent-child verbal interactions in language development.Consider Dipika Jha from Maitighar, Kathmandu, a mother who once enjoyed imaginative tea parties with her daughter Kenjal. By the time Kenjal turned four, Dipika’s attention had shifted to her phone during their playtime. As Dipika scrolled through her social media feeds, Kenjal’s attempts to engage her mother grew increasingly desperate. Over time, Kenjal stopped trying and became increasingly silent. It was only a year later through Kenjal’s teacher that Dipika realised that her emotional absence was stunting Kenjal’s emotional development.Kenjal has begun to mimic her mother’s detachment. This lack of parental engagement was diminishing her ability to express emotions and build meaningful relationships.Research supports this growing detachment. The 2024 study published in ‘Frontiers’ also found that children’s emotional intelligence is negatively impacted by their parents’ phone use. When parents use screens in the presence of their children, the outward appearance of distraction sends a powerful message, “I’m not present.” This leads to what researchers call ‘still face,’ an expressionless appearance that can further inhibit a child’s ability to develop emotional skills.This parental ‘technoference’—the interference of technology in routine parent-child interactions—has far-reaching effects. According to a 2023 cohort study published in ‘JAMA Network’, children whose parents frequently used phones reported higher levels of anxiety, attention issues, and hyperactivity. The study, which tracked over 1,300 children aged 9-11, found that parental phone use disrupts important emotional and social cues, contributing to developmental delays in children. However, in today’s fast-paced work environment and digital landscape, many parents feel they have no choice.Laxmi Upadhyay, a grocery shop owner and a parent of a nine-year-old from Lalitpur, says, ‘These days, everything from paying bills to shopping and work is tied to our phones. It may seem like parents are always on their phones, but it’s hard to avoid using them.”Psychologist Bina Shrestha from “Mankaa Kura” (a mental health platform) says the solution isn’t for parents to avoid phones entirely, but tailoring the content they consume and their device habits. She adds, “With work now tied to gadgets and phones, especially for parents juggling jobs and further studies, people spend a lot of their time on devices. In the past, it was easier to separate work from home, but now, phones blur that line, leading to a lack of emotional and social connection for children.”According to her, from a child’s perspective, it often seems like their parents are constantly on their phones, and with the already poor communication patterns in many Nepali families, this lack of interaction creates a gap in parent-child relationships.Anuja, a 16-year-old from Kalanki, has seen this play out firsthand. Anuja (who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy) shared how her father, a reporter for an online media outlet, is always busy with his phone or laptop, even during family time. “Even at home, during dinner or family time, his attention is divided between us and his devices. I miss having real conversations with him, and now my eight-year-old brother is following the same habit, constantly playing video games on his phone”, said Anuja.The effects of this detachment are not only emotional but also behavioural, says psychologist Shrestha. Children, like Soham and Kenjal, mimic their parents’ screen habits, reinforcing a cycle of phone dependency that starts early and persists into adolescence. Dangers though don’t end with emotional detachment.With greater exposure to the internet comes heightened vulnerability. Research conducted by Voice of Children and KNH Germany in 2023 showed that 38.6 percent of girls and 32.3 percent of boys reported receiving sexual calls and messages.In fiscal year 2023-24, the Nepal Cyber Bureau recorded 635 cases of cyber violence involving children, up from 176 cases in fiscal year 2022-23—for a 260.8 percent rise.As parents manoeuvre the digital age, the responsibility of guiding their children through it has never been more critical. The irony of parents lamenting their children’s phone addiction while mirroring the same behaviour is a cycle that must be broken. Children are not born obsessed with screens—they learn it from the adults around them, says Shrestha. According to Shrestha, parents should establish work timetables, just as children have study schedules, to help kids understand when it’s time for work and when it’s family time. Parents should also explain to their children the purpose behind their phone or gadget usage. “As a work-from-home parent, I’ve made it a point to help my young child understand that when I’m on my phone, I’m working, as this differentiation is crucial for young children to learn….Otherwise, children may simply mimic our behaviour of spending time on gadgets and become isolated.”Many parents fall into the habit of giving their phones to their children to keep them occupied while they manage household chores. Shrestha warns that this practice diminishes critical parent-child interaction. Instead, she suggests watching appropriate and fun content together, which can create bonding and interaction for the emotional and language development of children.“Regulating screen time shouldn’t solely focus on limiting children’s usage; parents also need to manage their device habits. Children imitate parent’s behaviour so parents should model healthy interactions with technology”, she adds. \nTorrential rains in the last week of September caused devastation in many parts of the country. The death toll of the calamity crossed 200, thousands have been homeless, and the damage it has inflicted upon the national economy is still to be fully assessed. When disasters strike Nepal, the presence of the government in rescue and relief operations is usually symbolic: An earthmoving equipment here, an army unit there, or a team of bewildered police personnel at some places trying to cope with emergencies that they are neither trained nor equipped to handle. In a coping mechanism that is charitably called “the resilience of Nepali people”, the affected population is often back on its feet through individual efforts. Even though somewhat muted, the Hindu novena of Dashain was celebrated, and the preparations for the five-day-long Tihar festivities have already begun. Several squatters managed to reassemble their damaged shanties themselves in the floodplains soon after the rains subsided. Houses submerged due to overflowing drains in low-lying localities have been cleaned up through individual and community efforts. But in a testament to the apathy of all three tiers of the republican order in the country, debris deposited by floods continue to decompose in the riverbed, and plastic waste lifted by torrents still flutter like flags from branches of trees and lamp posts all along the Bagmati Corridor. Had the federal government considered it an emergency, an army team would have been deployed to clear the garbage from roads along the riverbed in the Kathmandu Valley within few days. The provincial government of Bagmati needed no new laws to show its presence during a calamity—even a symbolic act of the chief minister working with a shovel would have conveyed an uplifting message. Shamed into action, the Lalitpur metropolitan government has called upon its citizens to volunteer for the clean-up drive. It’s still not too late for the celebrity Mayor Balendra Shah to follow the lead of his senior colleague.Cultural rootsDespite loud claims to the contrary, almost all religions with their “packaged superstitions”—including political religions such as communism and free-market fundamentalism—are regressive, and Hinduism is no exception. With an established tradition of karma, vacuous pride in traditions and institutionalised inequality of caste hierarchy, it is harder for a republican order to take root in societies where the Sanatan Dharma is the dogma. If Hindu monarchs of the past were avatars of Vishnu, elected leaders seem to get away with characterisations such as “Durga astride a tiger” or a human being “not born biologically”. One doesn’t question a divine being even when the person must acquire political legitimacy through the popular mandate of lesser mortals. The transactional relationships of patronage and support between politicians and their followers aren’t uncommon, but the unquestioned loyalty of the herd to its shepherd perhaps owes its origin to the tribal instinct and religious beliefs extant in many societies.It seems the citizenry in Nepal get so little from their government and yet don’t complain because they have been conditioned to demand nothing from the representatives other than some personal favours in lieu of allegiance—an appointment, a contract or some assistance in favourably resolving a dispute—once in a while. Let alone integrity, even civility and decency are seldom expected from politicos who exercise control over the resources and instruments of the state. When the citizenry is apathetic, Premier Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli can easily get away with a questionable largesse from an oligarch under investigation to build the headquarters of the ruling party. Despite his past entanglements—OMNI scandal, links with Yeti Group, Giri Bandhu land swap case, profligate actions and outrageous outbursts—Sharma Oli remains the unquestioned supremo of the CPN-UML and an idolised chieftain of the Khas-Arya ethnonationalists across party lines.Former Deputy Prime Minister and Chair of Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), Rabi Lamichhane, has been arrested and remanded into custody for further investigations of serious charges on judicial orders. The Supreme Court had once removed him from the office of the deputy prime minister and ousted him from the membership of the parliament for violating citizenship laws. In any other country, it would have meant the end of a political career, but in the land of “Never ending peace and love” that is Nepal, Lamichhane continues to command the fierce loyalty of White Shirts and “People Like Us” (PLUs) of the urban middle class.In a society where piety is more prevalent than virtue and rituals are more valued than rationality, it’s extremely difficult to institutionalise republican principles of liberty, equality, fraternity and secularity. No wonder followers blindly line up in support of their petty, populist and ‘elected monarchs’ such as Sharma Oli, Lamichhane, Shah, or even the Mayor of Dharan sub-metropolitan city Harka Sampang. In a deeply rooted culture of piety and fealty, a political manipulator can get away with anything as long as he—leadership is a male bastion—manages to dupe the flock with his bluster and bombast.Economic compulsionsHardcore adherents of republicanism may disagree, but just as authoritarianism is intrinsic to monarchism, financial improprieties are integral to almost all electoral systems that reward their winners with enormous authority to disburse concessions and distribute freebies to oligarchs who have funded their rise to power. Legal theorist Camila Vergara recognises the “systemic corruption” and argues that grassroot assemblies independent of political parties and representative government can help establish an “anti-oligarchic republic” of plebians. However, it’s not unusual for uncanny oligarchs to exploit grassroots movements.It was argued that the Tea Party movement morphed into Trumpism with Trump agreeing that it “still exists — except now it’s called Make America Great Again.” Even though Arvind Kejriwal was the direct beneficiary of Anna Hazare’s India Against Corruption (IAC) campaign of the PLUs in India, it also prepared the ground for the phenomenal spread of Hindutva politics. There is undoubtedly some merit in Ram Manohar Lohia’s roar in Hindi, “Agar sadkein khamosh ho jayein tau Sansad awaara ho jati hai (If the streets fall silent, the Parliament goes berserk)”. But irrespective of its plebian, oligarchic or liberal antecedents, all republics have to ultimately go to the polls to acquire or renew their legitimacy. Civic movements are necessary but not sufficient for the functioning of a republic.No matter how well designed an electoral system is, polls are always skewed in favour of political parties with competitively large purses. The temptation of fresh entrants into the electoral fray to fall for dubious domestic or foreign contributions is thus understandable even if not acceptable. There is no easy treatment for the endemic disease of democratic systems, but perhaps institutionalisation through broadening of the support base and continuous correction of political parties can help alleviate painful symptoms.Building a sustainable and responsible political party is a work of generations that requires an ideological commitment of organisers and supporters alike. When people pay, parties will be forced to become accountable. Premier Sharma Oli’s alleged plans to ease party splits through an ordinance are not just shortsighted but downright dangerous. Ambitious politicos need to discard their privileges if they wish to build new platforms for themselves.  \nUntil two years ago, growing crops was a big challenge for farmer Jit Bahadur Khamcha Magar of Palpa in western Nepal. He had been a victim of the monkey menace for years. But these days Magar of Phek Dangsinghdanda, Ribdikot rural municipality-8 is not much worried. He plans to earn Rs700,000 from the same land which until two years ago yielded nothing because monkeys, including other wild animals, ate up all the crops. Some farmers even left the village.Magar's life suddenly changed after he started growing chillies. Monkeys don’t like chillies and they don't even come close to the crop. Till October, he sold chillies worth Rs 350,000 and plans to double the income by the end of this year. He has cultivated round chillies on three ropanies of land.“Previously, the crops were destroyed by monkeys, porcupines, boars and other animals. My income was just zero two years back,” said Magar. “This year, I expect a good earning as the chilli variety I’ve grown is highly demanded in the market.”Bishnu Bahadur Karki from Bhairabstan, Ribdikot rural municipality-4 hopes to earn Rs800,000 this year from round chilies. He has already made nearly a half of that. He still plans to earn Rs450,000 from the sales of round chillies.Karki, who has cultivated round chillis on six ropanis, said that the price of round chillies has nearly doubled this year.“We have not only got the value for our products, but market access too,” said Karki. “As the price is fixed in advance, it is less risky for farmers.”Besides Magar and Karki, nearly 1,500 farmers from Ribdikot rural municipality-8 are making an income from the crop. Ribdikot, once known for ginger production, now sees a future in round chilli cultivation.Round chillies were primarily cultivated in Ilam, Panchthar, Dhakuta of the east. Four years ago, round chillies were planted in Ribdikot as a trial but later the rural municipality earned more than Rs60 million from the commodity, and encouraged more farmers to grow the crop in a commercial way.With the increase in the value of round chilli this year, farmers easily managed the expenses for their festivities.“We used to take loans to celebrate festivals. But with the round chilli farming boom, we need no loans from anyone,” said Sita Khamcha of Phake, Ribdikot rural municipality. She hopes to earn Rs500,000 from round chillies.Last year, round chillies fetched Rs150 per kg but this year the minimum price has been set at Rs220 per kg. The floor price was set in coordination with Ribdikot rural municipality, said Sita. Farmers are getting Rs260 per kg.Farmers said the market is no problem for round chillies—both red and green varieties. Narayan Bahadur GC, a former ward chairman, is the director of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog. He introduced round chillies to local farmers with the support from the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation Project. “In Palpa, it is now grown commercially,” said GC. Initially, there was no certainty whether the output would be good, he added. Janak Acharya of Palungmainadi who cultivated round chillies on 200 ropanies as trial.Round chilli cultivation expanded after the local government encouraged farmers in every ward, providing them with training and subsidies in seed purchase.GC is working on the marketing of round chillies.The Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udyog collects round chillies from farmers, ensures its market and grades the output. Production of green chillies starts from May. This facilitation has encouraged farmers to engage in round chilli farming, said Ranjib Kunwar, manager of Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog.Kunwar said that most of the farmers bring their chilies to the factory. The farmers who do not take round chillies to the factory also make transactions of Rs10.5 million separately by selling them in the market. Traders supply round chillies to Butwal, Bhairahawa, Tansen and Pokhara.Palpa Ribdikot Akabare Khursani Udhyog sells red round chillies to noodle producers.Farmers of Ribdikot hope to earn Rs60 million from round chillies this year.So far, farmers have already sold round chillies for more than Rs30 million.Though the rural municipality supported round chilli cultivation in initial days, lately it has been providing subsidies in seeds only. \nHere’s what Prime Minister KP Oli told the parliament on Monday, saying he was giving the address for a “special” reason: “Nepal wants to maintain neighbourly relations as a good neighbour, not a petty, scheming neighbour…Nepal wants a similar behaviour on the part of its neighbours.”He pursued this line of argument, implying that India is wishing ill on Nepal, imposing on Nepal’s sovereignty and interfering in its independent status and policy. He then told the parliament that he would present the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.It basically amounts to saying he will complain to the UN about India’s behaviour. What a petty idea.Given his inherent character trait, PM Oli will find it difficult to develop trusted relations with India in the short term. His only option is to be diplomatic, predictable and consistent. So far, he’s not been able to do that. It does not bode well for Nepal’s foreign policy, which is the most important means of pursuing Nepal’s current priorities, including jobs, growth and climate change.Calculated relations Oli’s statement in the parliament indicates at least three things. First, his expectations from India have not been fulfilled. Second, his communications with the country have broken down. And third, he thinks India may be working to undermine his political authority.Let’s look at his expectations from the southern neighbour. Oli wants to hold high-level talks with PM Modi of India and build trusted relations.In the past two weeks, media reports and opinion pieces have discussed whether Oli would be invited to India or not. It has almost become customary in Nepal for a new prime minister to visit India first before embarking on other high-level visits. Such a custom indicates the value politicians accord to India, especially if they want their government to be stable.The second indication is that Oli is finding it difficult to communicate with people who matter in India. When you begin to communicate your feelings about India through the media, it indicates that your direct communications have either broken down or are ineffective.Behind Oli’s statement is an obvious intention to play the blame game or rally the public. India may be at fault for many things, but blaming India does not absolve him of inconsistencies on his part or the sheer inability to conduct diplomacy in a dignified manner.The third indication is even more significant. Oli has consistently promoted anti-Indian nationalism, and India finds it difficult to trust him. But would that alone be enough to undermine his government?Throughout history, India has had a significant influence on Nepal’s political process and decision-making. Through its influence on individuals who’ve received gifts, benefits, and resources, some at the highest levels, India holds significant leverage over political decision-making and, by extension, over policies and processes.An old playbookIndia’s calculated relations with the Nepali state came to the fore in August this year when Foreign Minister Arzu Rana Deuba visited India. New Delhi turned her visit into a high-profile affair even though she was unprepared to represent Nepal’s interests. Her visit, rather than building political trust, ended up creating more mistrust between Oli and New Delhi as well as between the Foreign Ministry and the Prime Minister’s Office.Although it is a matter of speculation, there are strong grounds to argue that such a courtesy would not have been extended to someone from the CPN (UML). It generates the question, at least in the public’s mind, whether India accorded special treatment to FM Rana as a “special” individual who happened to be the foreign minister and not as a representative of Nepal.Whether real or not, the perception that India is unhappy with Oli has fuelled the notion that the current government coalition is unstable.Throughout Nepal’s modern history, whenever top leaders are forced out, they tend to seek India’s support to regain power. I have heard firsthand from top political leaders that India used to put a pre-condition: First, demonstrate that you have people's support, then we will use our leverage to help you. Thus, the political leaders would launch a political campaign and hold mass meetings throughout the country. If the broader political environment favoured a political change, then India made the additional push.Now, as Pushpa Kamal Dahal tours the country, blaming a corrupt network of power brokers, we are reminded of this old playbook. During mass meetings, an embittered Dahal frequently alleges that “middlemen, brokers, and big cronies have gotten together, and with the strength of so-called numbers, have tried to strangle truth, justice…and good governance.” He also tells the public that his government was ousted because the investigations on corruption were leading to Budhanilkantha (Deuba’s residence) and Balkot (Oli’s residence).Oli’s inherent anti-Indian streakFor Oli, an inherent anti-Indian streak in his psychological make-up and an affinity with the Communist Party of China makes rapprochement with India difficult.In the last 10 years, Oli has made countless petty statements intended to rile and irritate India. He has also accorded China greater space in Nepal.In his book, former deputy PM Kamal Thapa expresses distaste at the way Oli made an unscheduled visit to China Gezhouba Group Corporation and disappeared for one and a half hours for a private meeting with Chinese Communist Party officials during his visit to China in 2016.Another issue is the Eminent Persons’ Group report, which Oli raised during the launch of Thapa’s book. “It would be good to receive the report,” he said during the programme. He made more anti-Indian remarks at another similar event.At present, any talk of the EPG report is viewed as an irritant by India, because it has consistently sent a clear diplomatic message that the report is dead. The unwillingness of a section of the Nepali populace to accept the message, including the CPN-UML, has not gone well in India.In a recent discussion programme, a former ambassador of India to Nepal indicated that the EPG report had become a new irritant in Nepal-India relations. He said that instead of insisting on the acceptance of the report, Nepal could pursue the individual issues identified. Trends in the last two decades indicate that instead of really trying to address the outstanding issues in Nepal-India relations, Nepali leaders are just interested in politicising them and gaining personal mileage.Nepal’s relationship with India has become more and more of a paradox. Nepal’s dominant ethno-nationalism is anti-Indian. Indeed, Nepal has many unresolved issues with India, but it’s economic development hinges on closer connectivity with India, which in turn hinges on trusted political relationships and ability to untangle complex issues.Snubbed by India, Oli is now headed to the US, where he could still get to meet a lukewarm Modi. He hopes to gain stature and make an impression at several forums including the UNGA, where he is scheduled to deliver speeches. We can only wish our PM well. \n\n\nRae was the envoy to Kathmandu during the promulgation of the 2015 constitution and the subsequent blockade. In this conversation, Rae talks about the evolution of Nepal-India ties since the blockade, regional geopolitics, what the two countries get wrong about each other, how New Delhi views Nepali communist parties and the governments they lead, and the change (if any) in India’s neighbourhood policy since the start of Narendra Modi’s third term in office. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nAfter being ousted from government leadership on July 12, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the third largest party in the House of Representatives, finds itself in uncharted territory, facing a long spell out of power for the for the first time in nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015. In a show of dissent, the party organised a protest rally in Kathmandu on October 26.As the main opposition party in the House, the Maoist Centre marked the new government’s 100th day with the protest rally, but its leaders say they have no specific programmes planned until the by-elections for the local level.The Election Commission is set to hold the by-elections for vacant seats in 39 local units on December 1. “Before the local-level by-election, our party may not organise any major event,\" Yubaraj Chaulagain, a Bagmati Province lawmaker and politburo member of the party, told the Post. “Now our focus will be on the by-elections.” Chaulagain also said that the party will convene a central committee meeting soon after the by-election to chart out the party's strategy ahead. Lekhanath Dahal, a federal lawmaker from the party, echoes Chaulagain, stating that while the party does not have any event, they were encouraged by public participation in their protest rally. He further adds that public interest in the Maoist Centre was evident from the turnout at the rally.“With the support of the people, we will come up with protest programmes against the steps taken by the current KP Sharma Oli-led government, which appears to be encouraging corruption and inefficient governance,” Dahal told the Post.Although Maoist Centre leaders assert that more people support their party because of their effective performance in the immediate past government, political analysts refuse to buy such claims. Like most other political parties, the Maoist Centre has also struggled with a lack of political agenda, which has caused a void in party activity, political analysts claim. “It is one thing to claim that the government under your leadership was better and more effective than others, but to claim that the Maoist Centre’s performance attracting the masses is farcical,” professor of political science Krishna Pokharel told the Post. In Pokhrel's opinion, the lack of a pro-people agenda has caused parties to drift away from the public. A clear example of this is their failure to come up with an effective programme for a long time, he said.Maoist Centre can provide a tough competition in the upcoming general elections if the party establishes itself as a strong opposition in Parliament, Pokharel adds.But the leaders of the Maoist center claim that it is wrong to say that they lack a pro-people programme and agenda. They say that they are working to reunite with the factions that split from the original Maoist party, to attract more public support.Since losing power, the Maoist center has made many efforts to strengthen itself, including reviving the Socialist Front. The party, which later forgot the Socialist Front that it created while in power, organised a meeting in July, right after losing power, and announced plans to reactivate it.However, with other parties affiliated to the Socialist Front focussed on their own internal issues, the front’s activities have stalled. The Front is an alliance of smaller, like-minded political parties with a socialist orientation.However, Lekhanath Dahal, the Maoist Centre leader, claims that the Socialist Front will hold a meeting soon. The Front’s meeting in July had formed a three-member task force to strengthen the front, and based on their recommendations, a full meeting will be scheduled soon. \nAs the government completes 100 days in office, some leaders from its major coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, have started to comment on the government’s performance—often unfavourably.Remarks by some key Congress leaders, particularly by senior Congress leader Shekhar Koirala, have alarmed a section of the governing parties. Congress is the largest party in the government led by KP Sharma Oli of the CPN-UML.Koirala, who contested for the post of party president and got defeated by Sher Bahadur Deuba three years ago, leads the anti-establishment faction in the party.Koirala has been raising critical questions against the government’s wrongdoings, causing apprehension among those in government. At times, he has even taken a stance against the government’s moves.For instance, Prime Minister Oli and Energy Minister Dipak Khadka are at loggerheads with Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) Managing Director Kul Man Ghising over whether or not to disrupt power supply to the companies defaulting in paying the NEA’s bills.In this prolonged dispute, Koirala has supported Ghising, who is backed by the main opposition, the CPN (Maoist Centre).Koirala was once a proponent of the Congress-UML coalition when Maoist Centre ditched the Congress to join hands with UML. He also played a role in forging an alliance with the UML to form a provincial government led by a Congress lawmaker in Koshi.Observers say that his latest stances are part of his strategy to present himself as a strong candidate for the party president in the next general convention, which should be held by the end of 2025 in accordance with the party statute.“It is possible that he is trying to establish himself as the main contender of the party leadership for the next convention, making the party rank and file believe that no other leaders can give alternatives to the party other than him,” Rajesh Gautam, a historian who has written multiple books on Congress, told the Post.As party president Sher Bahadur Deuba has already announced not to contest for the top post in the general convention, second-rung Congress leaders have already started making assumptions about the next leadership.Koirala, who lost to Deuba by a small margin for the party’s top post in 2021, is considered an untested leader because he hasn’t taken any key position in the party and has not even become a minister so far.Party leaders close to Koirala say that he was making comments based on the merit of the government’s performance.They say that by making such comments, Koirala has been trying to bring the government on the right track when it fumbles. Sometimes, he might seem harsh towards the government, but that is aimed at correcting the coalition and not toppling it, they argue.“Before Congress-UML came together to form the government, Koirala was one of the leaders who had advocated for the coalition of the two biggest parties,” Govindaraj Pokharel, a Congress leader close to Koirala, told the Post. “Therefore, as the proponent of the present coalition, he might have thought it was his moral duty to question the government if it cannot live up to its promise.”But Gautam differs.The performance of the government is below par and even the layman can find faults in its functioning, Gautam says.The Congress-UML government was formed in July based on a seven-point agreement, and its basic duty is to work to fulfill it. When the government deviates from its promised objectives to other issues, Pokharel says, Koirala sometimes becomes critical of the government to remind it of its objectives.In the recent party programme held on October 10, Koirala mentioned the three areas where the government had unnecessarily poked its nose: by not allowing the Nepal Electricity Authority (NEA) chief Kul Man Ghising to work as per his plan, by trying to unseat the Deputy Speaker Indira Magar Rana, and by planning to issue an ordinance related to Political Parties.Pokharel argues that Koirala has supported the government’s right move. When the government decided to constitute a high-level commission to recommend reforms to revitalise the ailing economy under the leadership of former finance secretary Rameshwar Khanal, Koirala welcomed it, Pokharel says.Apart from that, he adds, Koirala never criticised the government when it decided to take the tasks of the peace process ahead, pay the due amounts of sugarcane farmers, or form a committee to revitalise the country's tourism sector. However, the wrong act of the government should be questioned, and even though he is a leader from the coalition partner and he is not mincing words, Pokharel says.Jeevan Pariyar, a Congress joint general secretary, also says that Koirala's opinion on holding the government accountable should not be misinterpreted.“However, the government is still to fulfill its promises,” Pariyar told the Post.Two days ago, the government decided to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at government hospitals. Pariyar describes it as a latest example of the positive initiatives taken by the government.Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel decided on Sunday to provide free cancer treatment for children below 14 years of age at Kanti Children’s Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital and BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital Bharatpur.There is no point in getting disappointed by the government since it has only completed 100 days, Pariyar says.However, some Congress leaders think the government is not working as per their expectation.In Monday’s meeting of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee under the House of Representatives, Congress lawmaker Hirdayaram Thani raised several questions to Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak, a Congress leader, about the home ministry’s performance.“Where has the investigation on the irregularities on Giri Bandhu tea estate reached?” Thani questioned Home Minister Lekhak. The Giri Bandhu land scam is linked to Prime Minister Oli and Congress, which officially made its position clear through its parliamentary party meeting on May 14 and demanded an investigation into the decision-making process of the land swap permit. Thani also asked the home minister why investigations on various other corruption scams weren’t moving ahead satisfactorily.Pokharel, the Congress leader, says questioning the government does not mean the Congress leader does not favour this coalition government.“The duty of leaders who are representing the party in the government is to do better work,” Pokharel says. “It is also the duty of leaders out of the government to question it to make it accountable to the people.” \nCPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, addressing a mass gathering organised by the party in Kathmandu, stressed two issues on Saturday—that his party wasn’t in a hurry to bring down the present government and that they took to the streets to expose the government’s bad governance.Dahal claimed his party is now focused on introspection, reviewing the party’s activities and connecting with the people.Addressing the gathering, which was also projected as a show of force by the main opposition party, Dahal claimed the top Maoist leadership has undpledgedertaken a serious review of the party’s activities and that they won’t engage in any manoeuvring to topple the present government.“Our party made a mistake by forging alliance with reactionary forces in the past but we now vow not to repeat that mistake,” Dahal said. He to be honest with the people hereon.“Rest assured and run the government, don’t worry much about whether the Maoists will again come to power.”Observers, however, doubt Dahal’s claim as it has only been just over 100 days since the Maoist party was ousted from the government. They also say the party, while being in the government for most of the past decade or so, hasn’t achieved much.Moreover, whatever Dahal might say, there is no way to remove the government unless there is a tussle between the two major coalition partners—the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML.The observers thus see the Maoist Centre’s protest as an outcome of the Maoist leaders’ restlessness over being out of the government for some months. In the 275-strong House of Representatives that elects the prime minister, the biggest coalition partner, the Congress, has 88 seats while the prime minister’s UML party has 78 seats. Thus the two largest coalition partners alone command a comfortable majority. Some other fringe parties have also joined the government. Maoist Centre General Secretary Dev Gurung says Dahal addressed the issue after a meeting of the ruling parties on Friday concluded that efforts were on to topple the government.“Attempts to seek an alternative to the democratic system and government cannot be acceptable,” said the seven-point joint statement of the ruling parties. Gurung said that they just tried to clear the misconception. “Despite having a majority in the House, the way they are panicking about a possible government change is something unusual,” he said.Political experts said the only way to change the government at present is by proving a majority in the House.“The Maoists always get restless when they are not in the government, and it is no different now,” Mumaram Khanal, a political analyst, told the Post. “Today’s agitation is nothing but a means to show that the party’s relevance will remain intact until the next elections.”The Maoist Centre is a party that has been in power for most of the nine years since the promulgation of the constitution in 2015.But why did the party have to call for a protest no sooner than it had left the government? Maoist Centre General Secretary Gurung refused to answer the question. But when the same query was put before Agni Sapkota, vice-chair and spokesperson for the Maoist Centre, he accused the Oli government of failing on all fronts save for its initiative to push for the completion of the peace process. “That is one reason which compelled us to organise a meeting of this kind,” Sapkota said.After the formation of the UML-Congress coalition in mid-July, the ruling parties including the main opposition have amended the transitional justice related law.Similarly, the party leaders who spoke at the mass gathering on Saturday raised questions about the prime minister’s prolonged absence from the country even as Nepal was being ravaged by floods and landslides.Prime Minister Oli was in the United States to attend the United Nations General Assembly at the time. Some people then accused the prime minister of showing insensitivity after he refused to cut short his US trip. When the Post talked to some participants of Saturday’s mass gathering, they struggled to come up with a rationale for the protest programme. But a few of them did question the Oli government’s record on governance and the prime minister’s supposed protection of the corrupt people in the government even while cracking down on those from opposition parties. They also questioned the UML’s acceptance of a piece of expensive real estate from a controversial businessman. Min Bahadur Gurung, the owner of Bhatbhateni supermarket, on October 11 donated land to build the UML head office. Gurung is facing multiple corruption and fraud cases in court.“The Oli government has failed on multiple fronts and is working to protect the corrupt people,” one participant told the Post. “The previous government [led by Dahal] was toppled after it tried to prosecute corrupt politicians.”During his address, Dahal asked for answers from the government on the status of the investigation on the Bhutanese refugee scam, as well as on other alleged fraud cases such as the Bansbari land grab and Giribandhu Tea Estate scam. Dahal accused the government of protecting corrupt officials and sidestepping accountability measures. “This government appears to have been formed to shield—not expose—corruption,” he said.The Maoist chief also questioned why leaders from the UML and the Congress who have also been accused of misappropriating funds from various cooperatives, have faced no action. “Those named in the [parliamentary panel] report should be investigated and arrested if guilty,” he said, adding that selectively targeting opposition members for investigation is unjust.But political analyst Khanal doesn’t buy the argument. “Until today, which government has taken action against powerful people?” he questions. “What Dahal is saying is propaganda,” Khanal told the Post. While the Maoist Centre is accusing the government of not acting against some suspects in corruption scams, Khanal questioned why the suspects were not brought under the purview of the law while Dahal was the prime minister. \nPrime Minister KP Sharma Oli presented his government’s 100-day report on Wednesday. While presenting his accomplishments, Oli committed to take action against cooperatives frauds and to refund the money of depositors.As the prime minister claimed that the government was making progress in terms of creating the environment for returning the savings of cooperatives depositors, the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors has announced the fourth phase of protest, accusing the authorities of not implementing the agreements reached with them in the past.Alleging the government’s non-commitment to implementing its earlier promises made with the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors, leaders of the campaign on Thursday organised a press meet in Kathmandu on Thursday where they announced to start the fourth phase of protests from November 20.They said they would still wait for the government to implement the agreements until the deadline. The representatives of the victims claimed that the fourth phase of the protest would be a decisive one.“Despite reaching an eight-point agreement one-and-a-half months ago, the government has not cared to address the problem since. Therefore, we planned to resume our protest,” Kusluv KC, chair of the campaign, told the Post.“Minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation [Balaram Adhikari]’s claim at a press conference on Wednesday that they addressed our concerns made us furious.”The government had reached an eight-point agreement with the cooperatives victims on September 9. It was the third agreement signed between the government and the depositors who lost their savings within a year.“Not only are cooperatives frauds being prosecuted, but initiatives are also being taken to formulate a cooperatives authority act, and establish a cooperatives credit information centre and debt recovery tribunal that are necessary to refund depositors’ money,\" Prime Minister Oli said, while presenting the government's progress in its 100 days in office on Wednesday.Cooperatives victims resumed their third phase of protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year. They reached a seven-point agreement with Ranjita Shrestha, then-minister for land management, cooperatives, and poverty alleviation.As the agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of agitation. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with Minister Adhikari.The victims suspended their 108-day protest following the eight-point agreement of September 9 as the government reiterated its promise to return their savings. The eight points were agreed upon after a negotiation between the representatives of the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperative Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary at the ministry.As per the agreement, a committee was formed with the sub-registrar of the Cooperatives Department as coordinator. Its mandate was to continuously assist in collecting and analysing data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, said Singh KC, a Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative victim, agreed to represent them on the committee. “The committee agreed to monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives, collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “The committee was supposed to present its findings and recommendations to the department after analysing the collected data.”But one and a half months after the third-phase agreement, government agencies did not seem positive about holding the meeting as agreed to solve the problem, KC blamed.The committee agreed to conduct financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them as well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and crisis-ridden, and recommend necessary actions. It was also agreed that a review meeting would be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to assess the committee’s progress. However, the cooperatives victims say no point of the agreement was implemented.Similarly, the agreement reaffirmed the government's commitment to implementing the previous agreements made with cooperatives victims.“The victims might have thought that the execution of the agreement means immediate receipt of money, which has not happened,” Tola Raj Upadhyaya, deputy registrar and information officer at the Department of Cooperatives, said. “But the government is seriously working to implement the agreement.”In a separate announcement, the government had announced to return the money of small depositors in troubled cooperatives during the budget presentation. It has, however, defaulted on this pledge as well.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024-25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors.“To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” then-finance minister Barsha Man Pun said in his budget speech in Parliament.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, five months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to carry out the refund.“Apart from drafting guidelines, we also are waiting for the real data on the cooperatives victims; we are yet to receive the data from the provincial and local governments,” Upadhyaya told the Post. “Once the data is obtained, the money of the victims will be returned by selling the property of the people who misappropriated cooperatives funds.” \nKathmandu Metropolitan City designates 47 locations for florists and vendors to reduce congestion and avoid last year's sales issues, encouraging the use of Nepali flowers and prohibiting plastic bouquets.\nA bus accident in Kharipati leaves ten injured, two in critical condition after colliding with a pole.\nKathmandu Valley Police relaunch no-horn campaign, focusing on noise pollution reduction and stricter enforcement against violators.\nKathmandu Metropolitan City, in response to worsening air quality, will initiate vehicle emission testing after acquiring a smoke meter, with the support of other stakeholders and in accordance with established guidelines.\nDashain public transport ticket bookings commence Saturday with enhanced safety measures, online options, and 24/7 citizen assistance despite concerns over road conditions and high demand.\nIncreased access to safe drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene in Nepal could reduce malaria and dengue cases while combating climate change, which poses significant economic and health risks for the region, urging urgent action for adaptation and mitigation.\n\nTihar festival, celebrated on Wednesday, faces elevated expenses due to increased prices of goods, especially food, flowers, gifts, and lights, attributed to heavy rainfall affecting production and imports.\n\nIn rural Madhesh, where cultural norms and limited access to healthcare compound an already fragile health infrastructure, women’s sexual and reproductive health needs are often sidelined.For many women there, awareness of their own bodies and health needs remains a distant reality. Seeking help for sexual and reproductive health (SRH) issues is often a last resort.Seema Kumari Pasman, a 20-year-old from Karmahi village in Dhanusha who the Post is identifying with a pseudonym for privacy, is one such example.Married at 16 in 2019, she quickly became a mother of two children by 2022.After two child births, her menstrual complications worsened, yet she had no frame of reference to understand that what she was experiencing—menorrhagia, or abnormally heavy bleeding—was a medical condition.Pasman endured a year of painful, prolonged periods that she had been taught were simply part of a woman’s life—a burden, not a condition needing treatment.Daily chores became unbearable for her but those around her continued to dismiss her symptoms.One night in December 2023, after collapsing while fetching water from a hand pump, Pasman’s family rushed her to Janakpur Provincial Hospital.There, doctors diagnosed her with severe anaemia from untreated menorrhagia. “The doctors told me that if I had received earlier intervention, my suffering could have been prevented...but I only thought it was normal,” Pasman says.The culture of silence around SRH issues means that women like Pasman get help only when their conditions are critical.A 2018 study in the Journal of Health and Allied Sciences reported low awareness of SRH rights among 384 married Madheshi women in Sarlahi. Three-fifths were unaware of these rights, and the same proportion reported experiences of physical and dowry-related violence.Chandra Rekha Issar, a gynaecologist at Janakpur Provincial Hospital and assistant professor at the Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences (MIHS), says that for many women, the concept of openly talking about SRH—especially with male doctors—is almost unthinkable.In rural Madhesh, as part of ‘ghunghat pratha’, married women have limited interaction with unrelated men outside their family. They are often expected to wear a veil in front of everyone except their husbands and rarely go outside alone for extended periods.This restrictive environment creates a hesitation among women to discuss their SRH. When these women visit a gynaecologist and are assigned a male doctor, it often leads to discomfort.Health consultations can thus become uncomfortable or are avoided altogether, exacerbating a pattern of undiagnosed and untreated conditions.At Janakpur Hospital, this cultural barrier plays out every single day.Kamala Devi Mandal, a 30-year-old woman from Khariyani, Janakpur, sat clutching her veil in the waiting area of the Department of Gynaecology, with her mother in law on the side.When her turn came, Mandal hesitated upon seeing a male gynaecologist, Raj Kishor Pandit, at the door. Despite a female attendant’s presence, Mandal’s mother-in-law ultimately did the talking, while Kamala remained silent, visibly uncomfortable.For Issar, these hesitations are all too familiar. She works alongside male gynaecologists in a department where only four of the 13 doctors are female.“In a setting where women are uncomfortable speaking about reproductive issues, especially with male doctors, we have to proceed carefully, often through the person accompanying the patient,” she says.Most of the female patients are accompanied by family members, as husbands are often working abroad.For something as basic as the date of their last menstrual cycle, the patient often defers to the person accompanying her. “Most of them are under a veil,” Issar added, “and removing it, even for an eye check to assess anaemia, takes coaxing… It requires long counselling for women to open up. At times, the information we receive is incomplete, which creates challenges in treatment.”If patients still hesitate to see a male gynaecologist after counselling, a female gynaecologist is assigned when possible, says Issar. However, this is often unfeasible during busy hours due to limited staff compared to the high patient load.Gynecologist Issar says that about 85 percent of the hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics cases involve pregnancy-related complications, often worsened by malnutrition, lack of prenatal care, and early marriages.General gynaecology accounts for 15 percent of patients, with menstrual issues like dysmenorrhea and heavy bleeding common among adolescents under 19, while older patients face infections, cervical cancer, and uterine prolapse.Due to early marriages, multiple childbirths, and home deliveries without medical supervision, many women develop uterine prolapse—a condition typically seen in older women but increasingly common in those as young as 30 in rural Madhesh.The gendered expectations that govern interactions in rural Madhesh leave women ill-equipped to advocate for their health.“During a health camp in Saptari, I found that over ten percent of women under 35 had uterine prolapse,” Issar says. “Early marriage and childbirth in an environment without health education or postnatal care have serious consequences.”The barriers also include outdated beliefs and superstitions which affect women’s diet and recovery after childbirth.“Although the situation has improved, women in remote Madhesh are often prohibited from consuming protein-rich foods like chicken soup or meat after giving birth,” says 24 year old Sapana Ray, a bachelor’s student in public health at Madhesh Institute of Health Sciences. “They are typically allowed only one meal of roti and are discouraged from more water and meal, as it’s believed that this prevents colds and other illnesses in the child,” Ray added, “This lack of nutrition contributes to malnutrition and anaemia, exacerbating their health issues.”When rural women lack basic health literacy, common gynaecological issues go unchecked, leading to preventable complications. For instance, over 80 percent of cases at Janakpur Provincial Hospital are critical.“Most of these severe cases could have been prevented with early intervention or just an understanding of basic health,” Issar says.As Issar sees it, comprehensive awareness campaigns are crucial for educating women about sexual and reproductive health.“The government should consider monthly outreach programmes in rural areas. Women in far rural communities need direct, consistent health education,” Issar says. Further, local health posts with trained personnel could provide preventive care and answer questions women may hesitate to bring up in a hospital setting.The hospital’s efforts to include female attendants in male doctors’ consultations and to counsel women on gender-neutral healthcare only go so far. Often, patients’ deep-seated fears and hesitation prove challenging to overcome.While Madhesh’s women struggle with silence and a lack of resources, healthcare professionals are left piecing together fragmented stories, trying to heal patients who are often reluctant to share their suffering. It is a race against time and tradition.Dr Issar says that it’s unfair to blame women for hesitating to discuss their issues with gynaecologists. “We need to understand and empathise with their background,” she says.Many women, living in conservative settings, rarely have the freedom to speak openly. Given this, she questions, “How can we expect them to feel fully comfortable discussing their sexual and reproductive health, especially with a male doctor?” Even for educated urban women, she adds, these conversations can be challenging.According to Ray, consistent ground-level awareness and counselling programmes on SRH are essential, alongside changes to the conservative and predominantly patriarchal settings in rural areas. “These social barriers, even more than medical intervention, are often the primary obstacles to healthcare access for women in these communities,” she says. \nOfficers and employees at the Ministry of Health and Population and the Department of Health Services will receive training on coping with mental health problems.Officials hope that the training will help employees understand common mental health conditions and identify warning signs of depression, anxiety, stress and other psychological issues.“Employees are human beings too and can suffer from various health conditions, including mental health conditions,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have planned to impart one-day training to the employees at the Health Ministry and the Department of Health Services.”Officials say that 80 of the 160 employees serving at the Health Ministry and at the Department of Health Services will receive training first, and the rest will receive it another day. They say the training would be provided to employees of other ministries only if they get positive results from the training imparted to Health Ministry officials.Studies carried out in the past show that the majority of government officials at Singha Durbar suffered from multiple health complications such as hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, kidney diseases, anxiety and depression. Health problems could have been exacerbated since the workplace environment hasn’t improved, the studies showed.Singha Durbar is the country’s federal administrative heart where most ministries and important government offices are located. Reports show that many civil servants are unaware of their health ailments.Doctors say a sedentary lifestyle, poor eating habits and stress contribute to the health crisis among government employees. They advise employees to visit a hospital if they feel something is wrong with their health.Of late, noncommunicable diseases have emerged as the leading killers in Nepal, and its reflection can also be seen among government employees.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases found that the diseases accounted for 71 percent of the country's deaths.The study shows that hypertension, diabetes, renal malfunction, liver problems, heart issues and cervical cancer are responsible for the majority of morbidity and mortality in Nepal.The findings showed that the leading risk factor of death in 2019 was smoking, whose attributable death was 17.7 percent, followed by high systolic blood pressure at 12.3 percent, household air pollution at 11.2 percent, ambient air pollution at 9.3 percent, diabetes at 8 percent, and high cholesterol and kidney dysfunction, among others.The study was primarily focused on behavioural risk factors, including tobacco and alcohol consumption, and biological risk factors—raised blood pressure, heavyweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.To address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases, the government has previously announced that it will carry out free screening of non-communicable diseases of people over 40. However, the programme has not yet been started.Public health experts say the increase in non-communicable diseases is a global phenomenon, but developing countries like Nepal have been facing a double burden.They say that many lives can be saved if people are screened for non-communicable diseases for free. \nAs Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel is on a spree announcing one populist programme after another, health agencies under his ministry are reaching out to aid organisations for small amounts to basic training.Officials say they do not even have the budget to provide mental health screening training to children and adolescents, and this has delayed the planned programme.“We have been asking aid agencies for help to carry out training programmes for health workers,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media. “The minister is busy unveiling new free programmes but does not bother to learn about the real problems.”On Monday and Tuesday, Minister Paudel announced three free programmes that include free treatment for children under 14 with cancer, free treatment and health check-ups for women soccer players injured in matches, and upgrades to the Sailaja Acharya Heart Disease Centre in Biratnagar. Last week, Paudel pledged free care for poor burn victims who cannot afford treatment. However, most health facilities offering burn care provide only basic treatments, which often puts patients' safety at risk. Since taking office three months ago, Minister Paudel has announced several other populist programmes.While most of these initiatives—which include reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—have yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce more free programmes.Experts have questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of such programmes stating that previous ministers and governments would also have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Only those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different,” said Sagar Rjbhandari, a health expert. Many other health programmes, including nutritious food for pregnant and nursing mothers and children in Karnali Province, as well as maternal and perinatal death surveillance, among others, have been affected by budget constraints in the current fiscal year.Health Ministry officials said they have requested UNICEF for financial help to impart mental health screening training of children for health workers.“We need around Rs700,000 to train health workers, including doctors, nurses, and paramedics, on mental health screening for children and adolescents,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “UNICEF has responded positively to our request. A four-day screening training will be organised in the fourth quarter of the current fiscal year.”Officials said that they plan to train 150 health workers.“We hope that the health worker training will help reduce existing mental health problems among children and adolescents,” said Thapa. “Those serving in primary health care centres will be trained first to ensure that children and adolescents in villages will easily access the services.”A report from the National Mental Health Survey Nepal-2020 shows that the prevalence of mental disorders among adolescents was 5.2 percent that year, and neurotic and stress-related disorders were the most common at 2.8 percent.Likewise, the prevalence of current suicidal thoughts among adolescents was around four percent, while the rate of suicidal attempts in the same age group was 0.7 percent. The report also shows that 0.6 percent of children and adolescents were found to have been suffering from depression.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, lifetime suicidal attempts, and the future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to affect 7.2 percent of the population.Experts say that mental health problems in children and adolescents could be several times more than what the survey portrays. They say that around 10 to 15 percent of the total children and adolescent population could have been suffering from various types of mental health issues, and due to methodological problems, the survey may not accurately portray the actual problems.Health officials say that there are only around half a dozen child and adolescent psychiatric doctors in the country, and only a few are serving in state-run health facilities. Similarly, the major contributors to the treatment gap are societal beliefs, traditions and stigma associated with mental disorders, according to experts.“This training will help health workers identify problems and refer patients to health facilities with child psychiatrists and psychologists,” said Thapa.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal. \nDozens of children with severe urological birth defects and rare urological conditions in HCM City, Vinh, Hà Nội and Đà Nẵng are receiving free genital surgeries under the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme – a project that offers child genital reconstruction surgeries in Việt Nam.Part of an annual programme that started 18 years ago, these surgeries are being performed from October 18 to November 9 by a volunteer medical team from Italy, England, Egypt and the UAE, led by Italian surgeon Dr Roberto De Castro.The surgeries take place at Children’s Hospital 2 in HCM City, the Nghệ An Obstetrics and Pediatrics Hospital in Vinh City, the National Pediatric Hospital and Việt Đức Hospital in Hà Nội, and the Đà Nẵng Children and Women’s Hospital in Đà Nẵng City.Over decades, Dr De Castro has performed pioneering surgical techniques to effectively treat genital malformations and injuries in both boys and girls to allow them to live full lives.One of De Castro’s biggest success stories is Phùng Thiện Nhân, who was abandoned by his biological mother at birth in a remote area in the central province of Quảng Nam. When Nhân was found three days later, he was barely alive and had lost most of his genitals and one leg due to a brutal attack by wild animals.The infant survived the incident and was subsequently adopted by journalist Trần Mai Anh, moving to Hà Nội with his new family. With the support of De Castro, Thiện Nhân received successful reconstructive surgery in January 2011.His foster mother, Mai Anh, later became the founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme which, together with the Asia Injury Prevention (AIP) Foundation, pays for surgeries, travel costs and medical supplies for poor Vietnamese children needing genital reconstruction.Over the years, the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme has conducted 630 surgeries, examinations and diagnoses for 2,000 children, with another 1,000 patients still awaiting treatment.Dozens of leading experts in paediatric reconstructive and urological surgery from around the world have participated in the programme. In Việt Nam, along with conducting examinations and surgeries, the international specialists also hold scientific workshops and hands-on training sessions with Vietnamese medical staff, sharing their experiences and introducing the latest advanced methods in paediatric urological surgery.According to founder of the AIP Foundation and co-founder of the ‘Thiện Nhân & Friends’ programme Greig Craft, the mission of the progamme is not just to treat a small number of children with genital disabilities.“By spreading the inspiration to live and sharing medical knowledge as leading experts come together, we believe that the impact will extend beyond the confines of the programme. We are fortunate that Thiện Nhân, our first patient, shares this vision and has chosen to become a scientist in the future,” he said.Eighteen years after being found in the jungle and given a second chance at life, Thiện Nhân has entered university. He chose the field of Artificial Intelligence, believing that “AI has the potential to revolutionise healthcare and improve the lives of many people, just as my life was transformed through medical intervention”. From these 18 years of experience, the young man is convinced that “empathy and patience will lead to miraculous achievements”.-In Association with ANN \nMinister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel announced on Sunday that the government would provide free treatment to children under 14 years of age suffering from various types of cancer.The move is the latest in a series of populist announcements made by Paudel since taking office around three months ago.While most of these initiatives—reducing hospital wait times, increasing government health insurance coverage to Rs500,000, and providing outpatient care on public holidays—are yet to be implemented, Paudel continues to announce new free programmes.According to a press statement issued by Paudel’s secretariat, free cancer treatment will be provided by Kanti Children's Hospital, Bhaktapur Cancer Hospital, and Chitwan-based BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital, starting November 16. The federal government has already been providing Rs100,000 in relief to each cancer patient, including children, while the provincial government provides another Rs100,000. Officials said that the Health Ministry will cover any additional amount required for the treatment of children under 14 years with cancer from its internal sources.A few days ago, Paudel also promised free care for impoverished burn victims who cannot afford treatment costs.However, most health facilities that offer burn care provide only basic treatment, which often do not ensure patient safety.Experts have welcomed the government’s decisions. However, they questioned the effectiveness and sustainability of the programmes announced by Paudel. They say that previous ministers and governments would have made similar decisions if there were simple solutions.“Most programmes announced by the current health minister cannot be implemented due to various limitations,” said Dr Sagar Rajbhandari, a health expert. “Those who are unaware of the limitations and working style of our health system could be impressed by these populist announcements, but the reality is quite different.”Due to the lack of positron emission tomography (PET) scans, immunohistochemistry, bone marrow transplants, and other tests available for children, patients are often compelled to travel to India for treatment. Health facilities providing cancer care for children said that they lacked support staff, including trained nurses and paramedics. “Along with the decision to provide free care to children with cancer, we hope the government will invest in improving health facilities with the necessary equipment and trained human resources, which will help ensure quality care within the country,” said Dr Sudhir Sapkota, a pediatric oncologist at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. “Many patients cannot afford to go to India for these tests.”According to doctors, PET scans are essential for determining the stage of cancer. This test provides more accurate reports than any other in identifying local or metastatic tumours (which spread to other areas of the body).Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used to diagnose cancer, predict response, and determine likely disease outcomes. It also helps distinguish between different types of cancer.Likewise, bone marrow replacement is necessary when existing bone marrow fails to work properly with new stem cells. Bone marrow transplantation provides new stem cells, which help kill cancer cells directly.“‘If we can start offering the aforementioned services within the country, patients do not have to go India or other countries for treatment,” said Sapkota. “I hope the government will also work to address these shortcomings in the coming days.”It is estimated that every year in Nepal, around 1,500 children under 14 years of age suffer from various types of cancer. Of them, around 200 seek treatment at the Kanti Children’s Hospital. Doctors at the hospital said that around 50 percent of the patients suffer from blood cancer. Those seeking care at the first and second stages of cancer have a chance of full recovery. However, due to a lack of diagnosis facilities in most parts of the country, many patients seek treatment at the third and fourth stages. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal suffered a 37-run loss to the US in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 tri-series match on Saturday in Dallas, US.Batting first, the US set a challenging total of 281-8 in their 50 overs. Captain Monank Patel led with a composed 67 off 81 balls, supported by Saiteja Mukkamalla’s 75 off 87, building a solid foundation. Late in the innings, Harmeet Singh added crucial runs, smashing 59 off 44 balls to push the total past 280.For Nepal, Gulsan Jha was the pick of the bowlers, claiming three wickets, while Sandeep Lamichhane and Sompal Kami took two each.In response, Nepal’s chase started poorly with Aasif Sheikh falling in the second over. Anil Sah steadied the innings with 52 off 80 balls, while Kushal Bhurtel’s 29 took Nepal to 106-2 by the 27th over. However, Sah’s dismissal sparked a collapse, including the quick departure of captain Rohit Paudel for just 1.Sompal Kami injected late energy with a brisk 46 off 27 balls, hitting four boundaries and two sixes, but his efforts couldn’t bridge the gap as Nepal were bowled out for 244 in 49.5 overs.US bowlers were disciplined, with Saurabh Netravalkar taking 4-47, supported by Jasdeep Singh, Shadley van Schalkwyk, and Nosthush Kenjige, who each played a role in restricting Nepal’s chase. \nNepal’s run in the Hong Kong International Sixes tournament ended in the third quarter-finals on Saturday, with a 40-run defeat to Sri Lanka at Mong Kok. Sri Lanka set a challenging target of 124 runs after finishing on 123-2 in six overs.Sandun Weerakkody was a standout for Sri Lanka, retiring hurt after a blistering 50 off just 14 balls, which included four fours and five sixes. Captain Lihuru Madhusanka added a quick-fire 31 off 8 balls, while Lahiru Samarakoon’s 22 from 5 balls bolstered Sri Lanka’s impressive total. Nepal’s bowlers faced a tough inning, with Pratis GC and Narayan Joshi each taking a wicket but conceding at high economy rates.In response, Nepal lost captain Sundeep Jora early for a duck. Rashid Khan provided a glimmer of hope with a rapid 55 off 18 balls, hitting eight sixes, but lacked sufficient support from his teammates to chase down the target. Samarakoon’s 2-6 in one over and Tharindu Rathnayake’s 2-24 further curtailed Nepal’s run rate, and they finished at 83-6 in 5 overs.Lahiru Samarakoon was named Player of the Match for his all-round performance. Nepal reached the quarter-finals from Pool B after impressive victories over England and Australia. \nNepal edged out Australia by 11 runs in a thrilling match of the Hong Kong International Sixes at Mong Kok on Saturday.Winning the toss, Australia opted to field first, setting the stage for an explosive batting display from Nepal.Captain Sundeep Jora led Nepal’s innings, hammering 51 runs off just 16 balls with five fours and four sixes before retiring hurt. Lokesh Bam provided solid support with 33 off 13 balls, hitting three boundaries and three sixes. Bibek Yadav added a quick-fire 12 off 4 balls, while Rashid Khan’s late cameo of 12 off just 2 balls helped Nepal put a 112-run target.In response, Australia started shakily, losing captain Sam Heazlett early to Pratis GC for just one run. Jack Wood was the standout for Australia, scoring an impressive 55 off 16 balls with four boundaries and six sixes.Despite Wood’s efforts, Australia struggled against Nepal’s disciplined bowling, particularly Pratis GC, who claimed three wickets for 24 runs in his two overs. Other contributions from the Nepali bowlers included a wicket each from Lokesh Bam and Bibek Yadav to help the Rhinos restrict Australia to 100 runs.Earlier on Friday, Nepal defeated England by six wickets.

Nepal are participating in the tournament for the first time. \nThe government has announced it’d provide Rs300,000 to the players of the Nepali football team, who became the runners-up in the SAFF Women’s Championship.Tanka Lal Ghising, Member Secretary of the National Sports Council, announced this decision following Nepal’s defeat to Bangladesh in the championship final on Wednesday.In addition, the head coach will receive Rs200,000, while the manager, assistant coach, and team doctor will each receive Rs120,000 as prizes.Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli hosted a lunch meeting with the team members on Thursday at his official residence in Baluwatar. Prime Minister Oli, along with Deputy Prime Minister Prakash Man Singh and other officials, attended the stadium to watch the match between Nepal and Bangladesh on Wednesday.Additionally, on Wednesday, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City honoured the Nepali women’s football team with Rs2.5 million. Mayor Balendra Shah, Deputy Mayor Sunita Dangol, and Chief Administrative Officer Saroj Guragain handed over a cheque of Rs2.5 million to team captain Anjila Tumbapo Subba at Soaltee Hotel, witnessed by ANFA President Pankaj Nembang. \nA presidential election unlike any other in US history enters its last full day on Monday with Donald Trump, Kamala Harris and their campaigns scrambling to get supporters to the polls in a contest each portrays as an existential moment for America.Even after the astonishing blur of events the last few months, the electorate is divided down the middle, both nationally and in the seven battleground states expected to decide the winner on Tuesday, although the closeness of the contest means it could take days for a winner to emerge.Trump, a 78-year-old Republican, survived two assassination attempts, one by millimeters, just weeks after a jury in New York - the city whose tabloids first elevated him to national fame and notoriety - made him the first former US president to be convicted of a felony. Harris, 60, was catapulted to the top of the Democratic ticket in July - giving her a chance to become the first woman to hold the world’s most powerful job – after President Joe Biden, 81, had a disastrous debate performance and three weeks later dropped his reelection bid under pressure from his party.For all of that turmoil, the contours of the race have changed little. Polls show Harris and Trump running neck and neck nationally and in the battleground states. More than 77 million voters have already cast ballots, but the next two days will provide a critical test of whether Vice President Harris’ or former President Trump’s campaign does the better job of driving supporters to the polls.Voters, both Democrats and Republicans, have broken century-old records in the last two presidential elections, a sign of the passion that Trump stirs in both political parties.Jones reshaped modern pop music in his collaborations with Michael Jackson, while renowned for his work with stars like Frank Sinatra.In the final days of this campaign, both sides are flooding social media sites and TV and radio stations with a last round of ad campaigns, and racing to knock on doors and make calls.Harris’ campaign team believes the sheer size of its voter mobilization efforts is making a difference and says its volunteers knocked on hundreds of thousands of doors in each of the battleground states this weekend.”We are feeling very good about where we are right now,” campaign chair Jen O’Malley Dillon told reporters.The campaign says its internal data shows that undecided voters are breaking in their favor, particularly women in the battleground states, and that they see an increase in early voting among core parts of their coalition, including young voters and voters of color.Trump’s campaign has its own in-house canvassing operation, but has effectively outsourced most of the work to outside super PACs, allied political groups that can raise and spend unlimited sums of money.They have been more focused on contacting “low propensity” voters, or voters that often do not go to the polls, instead of appealing to middle-of-the-road voters who can flip to either side.Many in this category are Trump supporters, but they are not normally reliable voters.By cherry-picking the voters they want to contact, Trump and his team say they are sending door knockers to places where it makes a difference and being smart about spending.False Fraud ClaimsTrump and his allies, who falsely claim that his 2020 defeat was the result of fraud, have spent months laying the groundwork to again challenge the result if he loses. He has promised “retribution,” spoken of prosecuting his political rivals and described Democrats as the “enemy within.”On Sunday, Trump complained about gaps in the bullet-proof glass surrounding him as he spoke at a rally and mused that an assassin would have to shoot through the news media to get him, adding, “I don't mind that so much.”Harris has cast Trump as a danger to democracy but sounded optimistic at a Detroit church on Sunday.“As I travel, I see Americans from so-called red states to so-called blue states who are ready to bend the arc of history toward justice,” Harris said. “And the great thing about living in a democracy, as long as we can hold on to it, is that we have the power, each of us, to answer that question.”Voters responding to a late-October Reuters/Ipsos poll ranked threats to democracy as the second-biggest problem facing the US today, just behind the economy.Trump believes concerns about the economy and high prices, especially for food and rent, will carry him to the White House.“We’re going to cut your taxes, end inflation, slash your prices, raise your wages and bring thousands of factories back to America,” Trump said on Sunday at a midday rally in Lititz, Pennsylvania.His final day of campaigning on Monday will include stops in three of the seven battleground states expected to determine the winner. He will visit Raleigh, North Carolina; Reading and Pittsburgh in Pennsylvania, and Grand Rapids, Michigan. He then plans to return to Palm Beach, Florida, to vote and await election results.Harris plans to spend Monday campaigning in Pennsylvania, starting her day in Allentown, one of the most competitive parts of the state, before heading on to Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.Pennsylvania is the biggest prize among the battleground states, offering 19 of the 270 Electoral College votes a candidate needs to win the presidency.Nonpartisan US election analysts calculate Harris needs to win about 45 electoral votes in the seven swing states to win the White House, while Trump would need about 51, when accounting for the states they are forecast to win easily. \nChaaaiiittt…The spontaneous eruption of the sound of victory thundered through the neighbourhood of Nhyokha in the Kathmandu core. The line of a kite cut another. Looking out the window of her house, Sajani Shrestha saw children running full speed, shouting and fighting as they vied to catch the falling kite and thread. And craning her neck up to the sky, she could not count but only be mesmerised by the innumerable kites strewn across the skies of Nhyokha, Bangemudha, Indrachowk. “There would be so many kites that they entirely covered the blue of the sky, making beautiful patterns of different colours,” says the 51-year-old. “And you cannot imagine the number of times the call of chait rang in the air.”Clear blue sky and gentle westerlies, the season of kites has arrived in the Kathmandu Valley. While kites soared Kathmandu's sky mainly during Dashain, the kite season officially started in Nag Panchami (August) and ended on the Haribodhini Ekadashi (November). And from royalities to commoners, young and old all flew kites from rooftops and open grounds. Even those who did not, like Sajani, revelled in the live spectacle in the sky as kites soared and fought. With Bhimsen Thapa’s help, King Girvanyuddha flies kites The earliest written account of kite flying is believed to date to 200 BC in China. In Kathmandu, this tradition has religious and socio-cultural and environmental significance, says Tina Manandhar, lecturer of Nepalese History, Culture and Archaeology at Tribhuvan University. According to her, it is believed that kites in Kathmandu skies carry a message to the god of rain Indra that the valley's farmers have had enough rain for their crops. That is why Kathmandu farmers scolded anyone flying kites before plantation season.In an article ‘Changako Utpati Ra Bikas’ published in Gorkhapatra in 1995, historian Rajesh Gautam points to the lack of written documents indicating the exact time when kite culture was introduced in Nepal. Exploring different opinions on kite's introduction to Nepal, he writes that “some have opined the possibility that the skill and tradition of kite flying might have entered Nepal through India.” Yet some others, he writes, state that kites “came to Nepal from Japan during the time of [Rana PM] Dev Shumsher.”He concludes that most likely this tradition was introduced by Malla-era Newar traders: “But since Nepal’s relationship with Tibet and China is very old and direct, kites might have entered Nepal through the Newar traders who were engaged in the trade. One can estimate that the kite was introduced to Nepal during the (mediaeval) Malla regime.”In Social History of Nepal, TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi write that there exists documented evidence of the kite flying from the early 19th century. The authors state that Sundarananda, a contemporary poet, has mentioned that the young king Girvanyuddha Bikram Shah (r.1799-1816), with the help of Prime Minister Bhimsen Thapa, flew kites from the towering temple of Taleju Bhawani, Hanumandhoka. And when the king's kite cut the kites of the youngsters, they were located and rewarded with money.In Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Sardar Bhim Bahadur Pandey states that “During the month of Kartik [October-November] young and old all flew kites,” suggesting that kite culture was ubiquitous in Kathmandu by the early twentieth century.Anticipations and preparationsKite flying in Nepal requires a kite, a lattai (a wooden spool), thread and majha (homemade adhesive prepared by boiling snail slime, rice or sago, and powdered glass from burnt electric bulbs and coated on the line to sharpen it for kite fighting).77-year-old Nirmal Man Tuladhar, an avid kite flyer and retired professor of Linguistics at the Tribhuvan University, explains how Nepali tradition of kite flying was both expensive and needing advance preparation.“In our times, it wasn’t easy to fly kites,” he says. “We had to prepare majha …And as Nepali kites are fighter kites, we mainly fought with other kites [which meant we spent a lot of threads].”This preparation needed first and foremost of passing a hurdle: securing finances and materials to fly kites. While lattai was a one-time investment that could be saved for years, kites and threads had to be replenished every time a kite was cut.“Those were the times when parents wanted us to be more focused in our studies. They only gave money [to buy kites] after immense pestering,” says 80-year-old Dwarika Nath Dhungel, former Secretary of Nepal government, speaking of the 1950s and 1960s.Biodiversity specialist and botanist Tirtha Bahadur Shrestha, 86, was born in Mahabouddha and began flying kites from 1951-52. He saved what little money he got for afternoon snacks to buy Hattimar reel, a brand of line wound in a small lattai, which was strong and sharp and where majha stuck well.Raghuji Pant, a member of parliament, also recalls the difficulty in securing money to sustain his kite flying in and around Kathmandu core in the 1960s and early 1970s. “Four to five of my kites were cut in a day,” writes the 67-year-old in his 2019 article “Changa Jastai Udi Hidne Man” published in Himalkhabar. “[This caused] the line in the spool to shorten. From Bhadra [August-September] to one to one and a half months after Dashain I spent flying kites. So, it was difficult for me to have enough kites even after getting money from grandfather, grandmother, mother and everyone.”Kites and thread secured, now began the crucial work of preparing and applying majha whose strength determined how well it cut other kites. Govinda Tandon, 70, a historian and heritage expert, who grew up in Battisputali, was also an ardent kite flyer.“Materials for making majha were prepared right from the morning on a holiday,\" he writes in his article “Dashainko Butte Changa” published in Gorkhapatra. “Because this work couldn’t be accomplished without a collaboration of 3-4 friends, a holiday was set aside for this. Moreover, a sunny day was considered appropriate. If the majha didn’t dry, the thread could turn moist, and so if it felt like the day wouldn’t be sunny, the entire plan…was aborted.”Kite makers, kite sellers and variety of kites One of the oldest shops in Kathmandu's memory, Shree Chitrakar Kite Center in Tyauda, Asan is bustling with customers during Dashain. “When my grandmother got married and came to this house at age 12 [in early 1940s], this shop was already here,” says its fourth generation owner 47-year-old Dinoj Chitrakar. “So the shop must be around a hundred years old.”Another shop that stands out in Kathmandu's memory is Manandhar Kite Center in Kalimati, established in 1949, and currently run by brothers Mohan Man and Sundar Man Manandhar.In his book Antar Taranga, artist and writer Manuj Babu Mishra recalls “a kite shop near the old halwai shop of Chabahil” in the 1940s. Dhungel and his 1960 batchmates of Juddhodaya Public School recall the kite shops from the 1950s and 1960s – Bekhacha’s Shop at Netapacho, Bhaicha’s Shop at Nhyokha, Lata Manandhar’s Shop at Maru, Kanchha Buddha Bajracharya Shop at Tyauda.Besides the shops, there were makers and sellers of kites cloistered in different localities of Kathmandu Valley.In Kwalkhu, Patan was a Joshi who made Nepali paper kites.“One day I accompanied my uncle to buy kites,\" writes Dibya Giri, 69, in his 2023 article “Changa” in Sahitya Post. “I was amazed to see the huge stacks of kites there. We used to call it the house of the kite maker.”In Nhyokha, Purna Bahadur Shrestha began making kites as a teenager and started his own kite business in the 1950s, according to his daughter Sajani.These kites, made out of Nepali paper, often had different paintings. Mishra recalls painting kites for the kite shop in Chabahil.“I went to that kite shop and with the freely available colours and Nepali papers, I spent my day painting faces, birds, animals, masks, mountains, hills, whatever came to my mind,” he writes in the book. “Such kites apparently sold well!”Most septuagenarians and older generations like Tuladhar and Tirtha Bahadur recall flying kites made of Nepali paper when young. Tirtha Bahadur says that kites from Lucknow began coming to Kathmandu only after the late 1950s. But at least a section of Kathmandu was flying kites from Lucknow from the early twentieth century. Vaidya, Manandhar and Joshi write that the Ranas and Shahs imported kites from Lucknow and that from them, their favourite employees also got to fly some. These kites were large and, in Tyas Bakhatko Nepal, Pande writes that they were referred to as Lucknowia kites.Known for their characteristic hissing sound they made while flying, light body, swift movement and ability to take sharp turns, Lucknow kites were preferred by kite fighters.“Lucknow kites were lighter and could be manoeuvred well,” says Tuladhar. “Kites of Nepali paper were stable but difficult to manoeuvre. They were also expensive. So only some fighters flew Nepali paper kites.”The kites had different names depending upon their designs and colours – Ambe (a heart in the centre), Dibdibe (chequered), Pakhete (a different coloured paper on one edge), Sete (white-coloured), Nilchi (blue-coloured), Rate (red-coloured) and so on.The kite fighters preferred the strong and sharp Hattimar reel that came on a small lattai. The Belchamar reel was cheaper but weaker and prone to be cut by other threads. Kite fliers and kite watchers on rooftops and open groundsBibek Shrestha, 57, and his two brothers took stacks of kites and climbed their rooftops. The rooftops around theirs in the neighbourhood of Nhyokha – in fact in all core settlements of the Valley – were filled with kite fliers and spectators. Many risked precariously balancing on the sloped roofs.While Bibek and his brothers’ kites alighted to meet the sea of kites in the sky, their sister Sajani and other family members gathered around to revel in the live spectacle.Dhungel remembers the rooftops of Jhochhen and surroundings of the 1950s and 1960s swelled with kite fliers. Dhungel did try to fly kites. But he did not become a successful kite flyer. What he did become was, like Sajani and many Kathmandu residents, an admirer of kites soaring in the sky.“But more than engaging in my unsuccessful kite flying attempts, I enjoyed looking at the kites flying. There would be a big crowd of spectators. Females and other family members watched the kites fly as they ate meat and chiura. Some even drank and rejoiced as they flew kites.”When the age of cassette player and speakers dawned in the 1980s, songs blared from the speakers alongside kite flying. Chitrakar and Bibek invited their friends, put their favourite songs on speakers and spent entire afternoons flying kites, dancing, singing and eating.Away from the core cities, in the villages in the Valley, people flew kites in open fields. Like Dibya, who set his kite for flight from the banks of Godavari River in Tikathali. Chhauni was also a popular space for flying kites.Kathmandu’s joy in kite fightingBibek pulled his kite down and then manoeuvred it back up so his line touched his opponent's line from below and quickly reeled out his line. The resulting sharpness from the speed cut the opponent's line.Chaaaiiitttt………“The greatest fun comes from cutting another kite's string,” writes Tuladhar in his 1996 article “Cutting is the greatest fun” published in magazine Kite Lines. “With its coating of adhesive paste and ground glass, the string is as sharp and abrasive as sandpaper on your opponent's line.”Nepali kite, Tuladhar says, is made to fight other kites, and describes how a kite line cuts the other.“The technique is to touch your rival's string and immediately reel out line at high speed,” he writes. “The Nepalese style of kite flying is aggressive, and though the kites look simple, they are strategically designed for bringing down other kites.”At any given time, like Bibek’s kite above Nhyokha sky, skies above the Valley were filled with raging kites, swinging, coming down and going up as the fighters reeled in and out their lattais in ferocious attempts to bring down other kites.Meanwhile spectators cheered. “Even passersby stopped to look at the kites,” recalls Tina.The moment of a kite cutting was accompanied by the sound of chait, and children ran in the direction of the falling kite to grab it and the thread in what was termed as, Dibya says, changa lutne/dhago lutne.Dhungel always joined in to shout the chait resounding through the locality of Jhochhen and almost automatically his feet sped towards the severed kites' direction.“‘Oii leave that thread,’ the kite owner would scold me. ‘Why do you pull my thread, leave it right now.’ But I’d continue pulling the threads as the owner continued shouting. Other times I caught the kites that had failed to fly and dropped on the ground.”The fallen kites got stuck in the buildings, trees or poles, or glided down in the open grounds or paddy fields. Falling kites from the Kathmandu core settled down in Tundikhel covering it. Oftentimes kites fell on the fields to rest upon the lush paddy nearing its harvest.“Children ran straight into the fields to catch the kite,” says Dibya. \"They destroyed the crops by stepping on them. Some farmers chased them, scolding along as they did so and if they caught anyone, they slapped them.”Love and restrictions on kiteAmidst the raging kite fights high up in the sky, there were apparently also some quieter kites lingering much lower among the buildings or tree lines, for their goals lay in not ruthlessly cutting the threads of other kites but piercing softly through the hearts of their owners' love interests. During the Rana regime, there were designated public spaces to fly kites, writes Gautam in his article. Referring to oral accounts, he writes that the Ranas were particularly careful to avoid kite flyers around their durbars. This is because love-stricken men tied letters to kites and flew them into the durbars to their love interests among the nanis.He writes that the kites could be flown mainly on the grounds of Chhauni. Anyone flying kites in any other place and around Rana durbars were arrested.Pant also recalls love-stricken boys from his time. “Just as kites came in different colours and patterns, so did kite flyers,” he writes in the article. “Some wrote love letters using a few words in “symbolic language” on a plain kite and attempted to land it on the rooftop of the girl they liked. Some simply landed their kites on any rooftop if a girl appeared there and waited for reaction.”King Tribhuvan among kite fliersPande writes in his book: “Once or twice during kite season every year, King Tribhuvan went to Chhauni to fly kites. Legend has it that if the line of the king’s kite was cut, it flew to Lhasa. But since anyone who caught that kite received five rupees, everyone attempted to catch that kite.”In 2021 news report ‘Bhawanle Chhekidiyo Changa Udaune Aakash’ by Shivahari Ghimire published in Nayapatrika, cultural expert the late Satyamohan Joshi also recounts that “During Dashain, Tribhuvan came to the ground below Swayambhu to fly kites. […] He did not use the same thread to fly kites twice.”In the same article, Joshi says that the King also went to Budhanilakantha to fly kites and participate in kite flying competitions.End of season, end of cultureMohan Krishna Shrestha, 86, was born in Budhanilakantha. Every year, on the day of Haribodhini Ekadashi, he saw the annual fair at the Budhanilakantha Temple. He also witnessed kite fliers gathered in the open fields around the Temple.“Oh, it’d be a lot of people,” says Shrestha. “They came from all around Bhaktapur, Kathmandu and Lalitpur.”They flew kites on Ekadashi, Dwadashi and some even until Purnima.“They took all the remaining threads and kites that had survived Dashain and flew the last kites of the season,” says Tuladhar. “I remember my uncles, relatives and neighbours going to Budhanilakantha with their kites.”Joshi recalls in the 2021 article that King Tribhuvan also went to Budhanilakantha with his sons Mahendra, Himalaya and Basundhara. He greatly supported and also participated in the competitions there organised by the commoners. If he liked he gave prize money to the winners.This annual event lost its glory days after the decline in the open fields as buildings began to rise with the establishment of Budhanilkantha School in 1972, Mohan says.“The event survived in some form until the 1990s,” he says.But what happened after that?The end-of-the-season event in the 1990s was also an indication of the end of the age-old kite tradition.“If I go to my ancestral place in Asan to fly kites, it’s not possible for me to do that today because there are buildings everywhere,” says Tuladhar. “Cityscapes and urbanisation have created the obstacle for flying kites.”Dibya does feel like flying kites sometimes.“No space to fly kites today,” he says. “In the old times, there were river banks and open fields. Even if you fly kites, it gets stuck in somebody's rooftop or water tank or somewhere.”Yesteryear’s kite enthusiasts believe that increasing means of entertainment was another reason for the decline of kite culture.“When television came, kite flying started to slowly decrease,” says Bibek. “And then mobile phones robbed kite flying even more.”And so, when his sister Sajani cranes her neck up in the sky today, she rarely sees a kite.“Those days we heard one chait after another,” she says. “These days you won’t hear a single chait.” \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepali universities do not own and run academic presses, which are units that commission and publish academic works in the form of books and journals. Today, I am only concerned about books published by such entities.Nepal’s oldest university, Tribhuvan University (TU), does own a printing press. Started most likely in the early 1970s, it was then called University Press and has now become Tribhuvan University Press. While this entity might be necessary to print TU stationery such as the question papers for the many exams it conducts each year, I am not referring to such a physical press. Instead, I am talking about a proper publishing unit that solicits and commissions academic books and manages their peer-review process. Regarding manuscripts accepted for publication, the unit will also handle the copy-editing, layout and proofreading to see the book through to final production. In other words, I am looking for publishing units with imprints that might have names like Tribhuvan University Press, Kathmandu University Press and Pokhara University Press.University presses elsewhereThe university presses that mostly publish academic works (although increasingly also some general interest books) have existed in Europe and North America for a while. Oxford University Press and Cambridge University Press were established in the 16th century and are associated with the two eponymous British Universities. Some of the oldest university presses in the US such as the Johns Hopkins University Press and the University of Chicago Press are more than 120 years old. There are similar university presses in continental Europe, like Amsterdam University Press, and in Australia, like Melbourne University Publishing. Closer to our country, there are university presses in Japan (Kyoto University Press), Singapore (National University of Singapore Press) and Thailand (Chulalongkorn University Press). India does not have a strong tradition of such presses. The new Ashoka University has entered into a co-publishing arrangement with the publisher Permanent Black to put out books under the “Hedgehog & Fox” series. Most of the university presses do not make a profit. They serve the public via the production of academic texts. Their business operations are subsidised for the most part by their mother universities or subventions from third parties. In the US, these third parties have included the National Endowment for the Humanities and the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Their daily operations are managed by professionals with diverse experience in publishing. Each unit is usually supervised by a committee of academics from inside and outside the associated university. The Association of University Presses has more than 160 members from different countries. The American university press system was professionalised two decades after World War II. Since then, as former director of the University of Michigan Press Phil Pochoda explained in a 2012 article, the American university presses have provided a very important service for the larger academic community. As “superior teaching, institutional service, and professional reputation were no longer sufficient for moving into and up the faculty ranks,” the quality “of publication became … the primary qualification for faculty appointment” and promotion. Pochoda continued: “If administrations were to require published books as a major part of a decision on faculty tenure or promotion, then it was necessary for the books to arrive at that decision point already professionally authorised… (by) credentialed external reviewers.” Since there are only about 100 plus university presses in America and about 4,000 higher education institutions, Pochada suggested that these university “presses … are in fact subsidising… other universities and colleges.” Even as many features of the print-based American university press system of the previous century have been undone by the ongoing digital transitions in scholarly publishing, it still retains a solid role in the higher education landscape of the US.Possible hereNepal had a late start in academic publishing. When the print-based university press system was being fully finalised in America during the 1960s, Nepal’s oldest university, TU, had just started publishing scholarly resources such as the Journal of the Tribhuvan University (established 1964). Its departments and research centres started putting out their own publications in the 1970s. Even as publications by faculty members became important for their recruitment and promotion in the later decades, no decisions seem to have taken place regarding the starting of a publishing imprint inside TU. Triratna Manandhar, a former professor of history who taught at TU for about 40 years (from 1967 onwards) and served as humanities and social science dean for eight years, does not recall any conversation on this subject. Historian Bhaveswar Pangeni, who has written a book on the institutional history of TU and has done extensive research on the archives of the minutes of TU’s executive council, does not recall seeing a record of any related discussion. In its initial years, one can make the excuse that TU’s collective research community was a small one and hence something like TU Press was not viable. Given the significant increase in the number of researchers who work for TU and elsewhere, this excuse does not hold for the post-1990 period.The situation is not much different in our newer universities. Kathmandu University is now 30 plus years old and employs dozens of fine researchers in many different disciplines. In a functional university that exercises a good degree of autonomy and holds international aspirations, it is surprising that something like a Kathmandu University Press does not exist already. However, the former dean of its School of Arts, Sagar Raj Sharma, has told me that conversations around such an idea have been ongoing for a while. Everything done by Western universities need not be copied by Nepali universities. However, since universities are perceived to be the most legitimate source of knowledge production and distribution, starting university presses in our country would be a good idea. The truth is that a few academics in each of our universities who care about good scholarship could put together publishing programmes if they got their act together. Such an initiative will of course require the blessings of our university leaders, investments on interested people and some infusion of money. Faculty members could be provided incentives to take up publishing-related positions for three or more years. The needed money can be earmarked in funds made available to universities by the University Grants Commission or third parties. Academics working in research institutions inside and outside of Nepal with substantial publishing experiences could be recruited to serve as members of the supervisory boards.Some folks think that the era of printed books is already over. I don’t think that is the case. Print runs of recent academic books published in Nepal are larger than those in neighbouring India for a reason. The books still sell in Nepal. Hence, Nepali university presses should put out some great academic books—monographs reporting new research or those that synthesise the most recent knowledge on any given subject, edited volumes of new writings, or readers of old writings—desired by academics, students and members of the public. The collaborative work needed to run university presses might even ameliorate the deleterious effects of bhagbanda spoils in our universities. \nPrime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the world’s longest reigning female political leader, fled Bangladesh on August 5 2024, for the safety of India. Meanwhile, hundreds of thousands of protesters descended on Bangladesh’s capital city, Dhaka. The crowds ransacked her official residence, occupied the nation’s parliament and burnt down her family home.Hasina, who had ruled the country for more than 20 years in total, had been widely accused of turning autocratic and clamping down severely on any opposition to her rule.For many, the Bangladesh revolution offers hope in the context of growing global authoritarianism. It illustrates the power of the youth to confront entrenched leaders, and the fragility of authoritarianism. It also highlights a striking feature of contemporary global politics: how central capital cities are to the political life of nations.In our new book, Controlling the Capital: Political Dominance in the Urbanizing World, a diverse range of scholars argue that capital cities are crucial political sites. They’re where governing elites seek to assert and maintain political control, and they are also stages for political contestation.The book is focused on sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, the two fastest-urbanising regions of the world.Authors explore the strategies and tactics used by ruling elites to politically dominate their capital cities in Bangladesh, Ethiopia, Sri Lanka, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.The authors also consider how urban populations have engaged with these efforts. People may resist authority, but they can also cooperate with it in ways that benefit themselves—which sometimes reinforces or supports authoritarian control.This is increasingly important in the context of two contemporary trends. First, authoritarianism is growing globally. Just 10 years ago under half of the world’s population lived under authoritarian rule; now the figure is at 71 percent. The second trend is the ongoing rapid urbanisation of the world’s population, with the majority of us globally now living in urban areas.Urban unrestOver the past year we’ve seen how capital cities are spaces for contestation.Some pro-democracy movements draw from their own histories of struggle and the paths that have been carved by those before them. The template of Bangladesh’s 2024 revolution is ingrained in politics from the ways in which liberation was fought and how later struggles against authoritarian rule were won. The capital city has also been crucial, and students at Dhaka University were key mobilisers in such movements.In other contexts, the link between political resistance and urban areas is a relatively new and surprising route to political change. One example is “the struggle” seen in Sri Lanka’s capital Colombo and the unseating of the Rajapaksa family, who were perceived as increasingly authoritarian rulers of the country. The Colombo chapter in this volume highlights how such protests emerged in a context where urban unrest had rarely threatened those in power before.Even where anti-authoritarian protests have proved futile time and again, urban populations rarely remain quiet.In Kampala, Uganda, demonstrations prior to the 2021 elections resulted in a horrifying government crackdown. Inspired by events in neighbouring Kenya, protesters took to the streets once more in July 2024 to demonstrate against corruption.The protests that erupted in Nairobi from late June 2024 against tax rises engulfed the capital city. They continued for some time, fuelled by the brutal police response. Similarly, Nigeria’s 2020 #EndSARS protests against police brutality created a powerful movement in cities such as Abuja and Lagos which shook government, and resonated across much of the continent.In an age of social media, learning and mimicry across national borders is increasingly common. One of the defining images of Kenya’s 2024 urban uprising was of a group of men with their arms raised and crossed at the wrists—a gesture of anti-authoritarian protest that gained particular resonance several years back during neighbouring Ethiopia’s own uprising.As urban protest seems set to continue and spread—often taking intentionally similar forms—techniques of urban authoritarian control are more varied and complex.Strategies to dominate and control city populations can be dramatic and repressive—such as the brute force of police violence—and they can also be subtle, deeply ingrained, and sometimes difficult to discern.Authoritarian tacticsOur book argues that authoritarian leaders are increasingly aware of the power of the urban masses. As a result, they are using a range of subtle, and not-so-subtle, tactics to entrench their domination in capital cities.We broadly described two types of interventions that elites use.The first are policies and favours that actively build support among urban groups. These can range from inclusion in political parties to investments in social provisions or infrastructure to win support. The book’s chapter on Addis Ababa shows how the latter were particularly striking under the previous governing regime in Ethiopia.The second are repressive interventions that aim to crush opposition. These are also diverse, and include violent crackdowns, but also surveillance and intimidation.In practice, the two types of interventions often overlap. The line also blurs through various forms of manipulation. For instance, misinformation or the delivery of goods in exchange for performances of political loyalty, underpinned by implicit threats of coercion.We also highlight the significance of urban geography.Ruling elites often seek to divide city populations (for example inner-city dwellers versus the peripheries). This is evident in our book’s chapter on Colombo, Sri Lanka. The Rajapaksas tried to consolidate power by appealing to the new middle class suburbanites through “beautification” projects. But these displaced and excluded the inner-city poor.Chapters on Harare and Kampala also show how particular peripheral areas have become central to efforts to build an urban support base by Zanu-PF and the National Resistance Movement. This often plays out through the informal parcelling out of land to supporters.Contesting autocratic ruleConcerns about authoritarian politics are at an all-time high.Meanwhile, the contestation of autocratic rule will continue to erupt in cities, especially in rapidly urbanising parts of the world. In this context, the need to understand how autocracy and urbanisation collide could hardly be more important.If pro-democracy forces are to have any hope of prevailing against efforts by authoritarian ruling elites to entrench their position, there is a crucial need to better understand their urban strategies and tactics.

Taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, COP 29 is a critical platform for nations to collectively chart and negotiate a course of action on climate change.Alongside other negotiations, this year’s COP will especially focus on establishing a new era in climate finance with the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG), which will determine the financial support that developed countries provide developing nations for climate action. The goal builds upon a previous commitment made by developed countries in 2009 to mobilise $100 billion per year by 2020. This target was met for the first time in 2022, albeit with ongoing debates about its accuracy, adequacy and effectiveness.The NCQG is not merely a financial instrument; it embodies accountability, equity and justice principles. Developed countries bear historical responsibility for the climate crisis, while developing countries, often disproportionately vulnerable to its impacts, require significant support to mitigate risks and adapt to a changing climate. The devasting floods ravaged Nepal in the last week of September, claiming more than 200 lives and causing widespread destruction with estimated economic losses of Rs17 billion. This reminds us of this vulnerability and the urgent need for increased investment in climate adaptation measures. Importantly, the floods also highlight the escalating intensity of climate impacts and the skyrocketing demand for climate finance, particularly for adaptation. Yet, the disbursement of funds falls far short of what is required, and access to existing funds remains a significant challenge for vulnerable nations. For instance, a 2024 report by OECD/IEA reveals that of the $1,265 billion tracked in global climate mitigation and adaptation finance between 2021-22, developing countries received only an average of $179 billion, with just $30 billion going to the least developed countries (LDCs). These figures are despite the claims of overreporting of climate finance funds from developed countries, meaning that actual amounts could be even less. This illustrates the meagre reach of climate finance for low-income and least developed nations. The modality of climate finance disbursement is another contentious issue. A report by Climate Policy Initiative in 2023 shows that 61 percent of financial flows are in the form of debt instruments, while 33 percent are in the form of equity, and only 5 percent are in the form of grants. Approximately $561 billion was provided at market rates of the total debt, making up 53 percent of total tracked climate finance. This heavy dependence on debt as finance disbursement modalities to developing nations further exacerbates their financial burdens, many of which already face stagnant economies highly reliant on vulnerable sectors such as agriculture. Extreme weather events can further strain their resources, forcing them to divert significant portions of their budgets towards debt repayment instead of crucial adaptation and resilience-building measures.Charting a new courseA decisive shift is needed in how we approach climate finance. Given the increasing urgency to invest in climate action, the role of negotiators from LDCs like Nepal at COP29 can be instrumental in shaping the NCQG. To ensure that no nation is left behind in the fight against climate change, the NCQG should prioritise the following things.It is unacceptable that only 2 percent of global climate finance reached LDCs in 2021-22. The core challenges hindering LDCs from accessing climate finance include a lack of technical resources for project preparation, limited project management capacity, burdensome and inconsistent financier requirements, an inability to coordinate effectively with donors and financiers, weak public financial management practices and insufficient technical expertise in climate change programming. Therefore, when setting targets, the NCQG should incorporate elements that make finance more approachable and accessible for LDCs, considering the challenges they already endure.Climate finance has disproportionately focused on mitigation rather than adaptation for far too long. Despite global climate finance surpassing $1 trillion for the first time in 2021–22, only $63 billion (5 percent) was tracked as adaptation finance. The Adaptation Finance Gap 2023 estimates that the financial gap of adaptation is projected to reach as high as $415 annually by 2030. Closing this gap is where the NCQG could set strong targets, potentially leading to estimating and creating binding agreements to bridge the adaptation finance gap.Business, as usual, is fueling a climate catastrophe. The total cost of inaction could cost the global economy $1,266 trillion by the end of the century, according to the State of the Global Climate 2023 report. This is even if warming is limited to the ambitious target of 1.5 degrees Celcius. Annual climate finance will need to grow more than six-fold, reaching nearly $9 trillion by 2030 and further increasing to $10 trillion by 2050. In light of this, the NCQG must act as a catalyst for the urgent mobilisation of resources for adaptation and mitigation. Every dollar invested today will save countless dollars—and lives—tomorrow. While the need for increased climate finance is undeniable, ensuring it is fairly distributed and reaches the needy is equally crucial. Developing countries, often lacking the capacity to navigate complex funding mechanisms, are either being left behind or are struggling for years to access urgently required climate finance. The NCQG must champion equity, accessibility and faster disbursement, empowering vulnerable nations to take ownership. This means simplifying procedures and ensuring that funding reaches local communities where it can make the biggest difference.The World Economic Forum emphasises that the climate crisis is too big, too serious and too urgent to rely solely on the resources of public institutions. The NCQG negotiations must incentivise private sector involvement by creating an enabling environment in climate-friendly initiatives such as clean energy, sustainable transport, green infrastructure and climate-resilient agriculture. Although climate investments often require a long-term perspective, such projects’ social benefits and sustainability can offer a win-win for both the private sector and society. Finally, transparency is the bedrock of effective climate action. This means accurately tracking climate finance and distinguishing it from traditional development aid. Furthermore, innovative and equitable mechanisms are needed to maximise the impact of limited funds. By promoting greater transparency and developing innovative mechanisms to measure the effectiveness of climate investments, we may be able to ensure that these limited funds can be meaningfully used to achieve a sustainable future. This requires robust monitoring and evaluation frameworks that track progress, identify challenges and inform adaptive management strategies.These considerations are just the tip of the iceberg. Addressing the climate crisis demands a long-term commitment to transformative change, encompassing financial mechanisms, technological innovation, policy reforms and shifts in societal behaviour. The NCQG negotiations at COP29 represent a critical opportunity to lay the foundation for this transformative change, which is crucial for tackling the climate crisis. \nNepal has again shown how ill-prepared and neglectful it is about running a project built and handed over by a foreign friend. This has been Nepal’s chronic problem mainly after the 1990 political change: Nepali authorities have turned several entities built by or with the support of foreign donors into non-functioning bodies. The latest victim of neglect is the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway. India’s Konkan Railways Corporation Limited (KRCL) has been helping Nepal operate the railway by providing its staffers to run trains along the route. The Indian Railway Construction International Limited had built the section and handed it over to the Nepal Railway Company Limited in June last year. Erstwhile prime minister Sher Bahadur Deuba and his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi jointly flagged off the railway, which is considered a milestone in cross-border connectivity between the two countries.As Nepal’s only railway company had no trained staff to run the trains, the Indian company, KRCL, agreed to provide the human resources until the Nepali side had necessary staff, including technicians. The Indian company was also ready to train Nepalis. For that, all the Nepali side needed to do was select people and send them for training across the border. But Nepali authorities failed to do even that bare minimum. Eventually, the Indian company wrote to the Nepali side asking either to renew the contract that expires in December or terminate it. As Nepali authorities are still unprepared to run the train, they are planning to extend the contract with the KRCL for another year. The Indian company provides 28 railway technicians, including engine drivers, whom the local railway administration has been paying hefty amounts in salaries and perks. This is not the first project built with the support of a friendly country that Nepal has failed to run properly. In the 1970s, China built a 13-kilometre trolley bus route where buses operated through overhead electric cables from Kathmandu to Bhaktapur. Within years of China handing over the mass transit project, it started facing one after another managerial problems. Eventually, the project collapsed and the Nepal government closed it in 2009. The case of the Jayanagar-Kurtha cross-border railway will inspire no trust among either India or China, the two neighbours, both of whom supposedly want to boost rail connectivity with Nepal. The Indian side has been working to develop a cross-border Raxaul-Kathmandu railway line. The Indian company KRCL last year submitted its location survey report for the proposed line. Similarly, a China-Nepal cross-border railway project connecting Chinese city Kerung and Nepal’s capital Kathmandu has long been a stuff of Nepali dreams.For a relatively poor country like Nepal, there is no alternative to taking support from other countries to develop big projects. But such ventures should be taken as opportunities for both technology and skill transfer. Yet that is apparently not how the authorities in Kathmandu see things. If the country can’t build certain projects on its own, it should at least have a clear vision and a plan on how to run the ones it accepts from generous donors. If the country continues to be neglectful of the support of its foreign friends, not only will it reflect poorly on Nepal’s standing as a trusted partner. It will also show that the country is uninterested in learning from its friends abroad and in time developing its own capabilities to run vital projects and ventures. If Nepal cannot help itself, it is useless to seek outside help.  \nNo matter what happens in the South Asian Football Federation (SAFF) women’s championship at the Dashrath Rangasala today, Nepali football has already won. The script could have gone badly wrong last Sunday, when Nepal faced India in a heated semi-final. Tempers flared, and Nepali players at one point appeared ready to forfeit the match, the consequences be damned. But better sense prevailed, they took to the field again, and then went on to register one of the most memorable victories in the annals of Nepali sports. What was impressive was not just the spectacular victory of our women’s national team against India, the five-time champions, 4-2 on penalties, but also their manifest sportsmanship despite being at the end of some very iffy refereeing decisions.India has always been a formidable team, and this was only the second time our ladies had defeated the southern juggernaut. Although India must have anticipated a competitive match after their 1-0 defeat to Nepal in the tournament’s last edition, surely, they couldn’t have foreseen such a massive turnout of Nepali supporters eager to witness their women players take the field. This, combined with Nepal’s compact defence holding strong despite being down to 10 players, left the Indians formless after the second-half pause, which lasted over an hour following Preeti Kulung Rai’s disallowed equaliser to India’s Sangita Basfore’s 30-yard goal.The umpiring team’s decision to rule out Nepal’s goal following the referee’s restart while the Indians were celebrating Basfore’s strike sparked widespread criticism. The Nepali team had the right to protest; a goal cannot be disallowed after the referee restarts a match. The enraged crowd threw bottles and shouted, “Referee out,” alerting the security personnel in the overflowing stadium. In time, things calmed down and the Nepali women decided to fight back. The star players were Sabitra Bhandari, “Samba,” who scored the equalising goal as well as a penalty kick, and Anjana Rana Magar, the keeper who saved two penalties. The resilience and determination the national women’s team showed on the field touched every Nepali. Yes, the times are changing, and female players are finally getting the appreciation they deserve. However, the country should aim higher. The monthly salary for the women’s team is only around 30,000 per player as of August 2024. Nor do women get many chances to play domestically. Given the inability to earn in Nepal, many players go abroad in search of better opportunities. Likewise, while male footballers are busy playing several national-level leagues around the year, women’s leagues rarely take place and are poorly managed. In terms of prize money, men are usually rewarded with huge cash prizes, whereas the amounts are substantially less for women. Samba, the all-time highest-scoring footballer in Nepal and the only Nepali to play and score in a European league, was discovered by a National team referee in her home district’s women’s football tournament when she was 16. Other female footballers have similar stories. So having more grassroots leagues and tournaments that bring out hidden talents is vital to encourage women. Now, all eyes will be on our ladies who face Bangladesh in the finals today. The absence of Rekha Poudel, Samba’s attacking partner, will be felt as Bangladesh is a strong opponent we failed to defeat last time. But again, win or lose, the Nepali women’s fortitude and sportsmanship displayed last Sunday have already won the hearts of millions of Nepali football fans. They will be happy today so long as the Nepali team gives its 100 percent.  \nThe centrality of provinces in the healthy functioning of federal Nepal cannot be emphasised enough. Nearly a decade after Nepal’s embrace of federalism, the country’s provincial governments remain in a state of limbo. This has not only tarnished their image in the eyes of the general public but cast doubt on their very existence. People from different walks of life are calling for ditching the provinces altogether. But amid these calls, it is once again worth asking what has rendered the provinces ineffective. A small example from Karnali Province exemplifies the hurdles that provinces face. In 2019, the province came up with the idea of having an integrated administrative building to enhance its service delivery. But the project couldn’t get off the ground as the federal Ministry of Urban Planning never permitted the province to use the land at the proposed site. This case speaks volumes about the federal-provincial divide: If a province has to beg with the federal government for years to put up a building, what are its chances of getting more substantive rights and resources?The centralised approach is also evident in the federal level’s hesitation to adjust the police force at the provincial level. The federal government hasn’t even implemented the Police Personnel Adjustment Act endorsed by the federal parliament in 2019. The oversight extends to other critical areas like the passage of the Federal Civil Service Act. For example, the provinces demand that chief district officers function under provincial governments. Having their own police force and civil servants would have greatly helped with the functioning of the provincial governments—yet the leaders at the centre seem intent on blocking this all-important reform. Provinces also face obstacles in establishing autonomous institutions and managing resources locally, such as collecting fines and penalties in the transport sector. Such financial restriction adds to the burden provinces already face due to the 26 percent reduction in fiscal equalisation grants for the provinces, as we saw in this fiscal year. This in turn makes provinces dependent on the federal government for financial sources—which is apparently what their federal overlords want. What’s more, even the conditional grants they get are aligned to federal priorities rather than their own. These bottlenecks have severely limited the provincial governments’ initiatives and made it nearly impossible for them to respond effectively to their unique needs.The constitution of Nepal guarantees rights and powers to all three tiers of government—federal, provincial and local. Yet the federal government is reluctant to grant provinces their deserved rights, undermining decentralisation. In response, these provincial governments have repeatedly demanded that their voices be heard. Last month, the Koshi provincial government submitted a 10-point appeal to the National Development Action Committee, which is chaired by the prime minister, to heed their concerns on police adjustments to provinces. This is something positive, as it will build pressure on the federal authorities. All seven provinces should unite to make more efforts to hold the federal government accountable to the provinces’ needs.The sorry state of our provinces shows our federal authorities are uninterested in devolving power to provinces and in equal development across the country. This is a deceit as it goes against the spirit of federalism. If the public grievances against the provincial governments continue, it might embolden demands to abandon federalism altogether. Federalism in Nepal will thrive only if the leaders in Kathmandu abandon their centralised mindset and commit, above all, to empowering the provinces—the indispensable middle tier between the federal government and the local units.  \nFormer chief election commissioner Bhojraj Pokharel successfully conducted the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. He resigned from the position in 2009, after which he dedicated himself in the study of national and international politics. The Secretary-General of the United Nations appointed him to serve on several high-level panels—for Bangladesh’s 2008 parliamentary elections and for South Sudan’s referendum process in 2010-11. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Pokharel to better understand Nepal’s own electoral system and the influence of big business on its political parties.The latest episode of Bhatbhateni Supermarket owner Min Bahadur Gurung providing land to CPN-UML and his announcement of a sophisticated party office building at the land has of late been a topic of hot debate. People see this as an example of how politicians and businessmen work in collusion. How do you see it?Our legal provisions in this connection have some loopholes. The law allows political parties to collect donations to run their organisations, to contest elections and to carry out other activities. The law is silent on who can make such donations and how much they can do it. This is a gap in our law. Our political parties have for long been misusing the loopholes, and now they are doing so openly. The laws have also identified some sources of income for the parties such as the levy by their members, donations they get and the incomes the parties make in various ways. The amount they earn from these sources is negligible. But most major corruption cases, and mainly policy-related corruption, are linked to those who fund the political parties. This in turn is linked to the trend of elections increasingly becoming expensive. Politicians need money and those with money need access to powerful politicians. So, this is mutually beneficial for politicians and businesspeople. Such activities have been taking place for decades, but the level of such collusion has increased significantly of late.Is accepting donations from Gurung problematic as there are pending corruption and fraud cases against him or is accepting donations from business people inherently questionable?Our law hasn’t set clear criteria in this connection. Laws in some countries have categorically defined certain fundamental things such as from whom parties can take donations, how much and what type of money they can accept and how to make the deal transparent. In developed democracies, political financing is strictly monitored and regulated. In our case, we didn’t even fix the limit of the amount a businessperson can donate to a political party and whether that should be linked to the profit and tax the person pays to the state. Even the individuals who haven’t paid tax to the state citing losses in their businesses might be donating big sums to political parties or individual politicians. Therefore, there should be certain criteria to regulate political financing. Certain provisions empower the Election Commission to take action. For instance, if someone wants to help a political party or a candidate financially with more than Rs25,000, the person has to give the money through a bank. The commission can cancel someone’s candidacy or take other actions if the candidate is found to have made excessive expenses in breach of election laws. But our agencies are weak in terms of enforcement. The political parties submit the details of their financial transactions but that is often audited by a chartered accountant who might be a party cadre. The Election Commission hasn’t succeeded in investigating such malpractices. Will a law on conflict of interest help control such malpractices?We need a couple of things soon. First, the state should formulate and enforce a law on conflict of interest. It will define certain issues on conflict of interest involving politicians, business people and other stakeholders and make the officials making decisions accountable. Second, there is a need to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t. Of late, there is tendency of making decisions from Cabinet meetings to avoid prosecution from the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) as the anti-corruption body is not allowed to investigate Cabinet’s policy decisions. The CIAA leadership has an excuse not to get involved in the decisions of the politicians who appoint them. All Cabinet decisions are not policy decisions. So, it has become urgent to define what are policy decisions and what aren’t and what kind of issues the CIAA and other investigating agencies can investigate.People in general say that corruption has of late increased. Is that the case?There is no society completely free of corruption. I have been observing the functioning of our state mechanisms for the past five decades. During the Panchayat [1960-1990], everything was controlled by the palace. And, the royals and their kin were linked when there was a high-level corruption case. In the 1980s, a corruption case involving the procurement of a Boeing surfaced. A commission led by a Supreme Court justice showed the involvement of prince Gyanendra [who later became King] but its report was not implemented as the then King Birendra didn’t muster the courage to take action against his own brother. At the time, politicians didn’t dare to get involved in serious corruption cases as there was a fear of action from the palace. Over time, the volume of corruption increased with the increment in the amount of financial transactions. There is corruption even in countries like Japan and South Korea that have made exemplary progress in development. Leaders including prime ministers, ministers have been prosecuted and even faced jail terms on corruption charges. Based on that, some argue that corruption is somehow attached to development because there is mobilisation of huge resources. But there is a big difference with what is happening here. There, they take action against whoever is involved. Presidents and prime ministers have been jailed, some have even committed suicide. But in our case, top political leadership is not prosecuted. The other aspect is that after the reinstatement of democracy and the start of the republican order, the media made more corruption cases public, which was not the case during the King’s regime.Do you see any connection between the political parties and the rampant corruption in recent decades?Our party organisations became too burdensome. In developed democracies, political parties become active when there is a need for their role. At other times, they go ‘into hibernation’. The party leaders and members return to their regular businesses and remain busy there. For instance, at present, the Democrats and Republicans in the US have concentrated all their energy to help their respective candidates win. Once the election is over, they return to their regular businesses. Similar is the situation in other developed democracies. This happens when a democracy attains maturity. Conversely, in our case, the cadres are totally dependent on their organisations. And even general people want things done through party channels. From the grassroots to the centre, people go to party offices for recommendations to get something done from government agencies. This is how parties have become parallel power centres to the state agencies. The government bodies have been weakened. Hence, the way our political organisations, their leaders and cadres are managed has become the source of corruption. And it has weakened elected governments because they aren’t allowed to work independently. Government officials are also forced to work as per the order given by a head of the local chapter of a political party, not by the elected representatives with people’s mandate.There is another more concerning trend. These days the government’s decisions are influenced by certain interest groups that have huge money. There are around two dozen big business houses who influence the state’s decision-making process no matter which party leads the government. First they make informal decisions on certain key issues. Then, the Parliament, a government agency, or a court, whichever is concerned, endorses it. So now the real power doesn’t lie with elected representatives or state agencies. The interest groups wield real power.How to stop it?The state should fund political parties to cover their genuine expenses such as election expenditures and regular costs needed to run party organisations. This helps break the nexus between politicians and business tycoons and to check corruption. Once the political parties get money from state coffers, their expenditures will be strictly regulated by the law. They won’t be allowed to take outside donations. After that, the Office of the Auditor General will audit their accounts.But how can we ensure the parties and their leaders are taking no donations even after they get state funding?The law will bar both the donors and recipients from being involved in offering and taking donations. Then, the donors can say that they can’t give money to the political parties as that will be a crime of breaching the law. The policy only works if the state agencies strongly enforce the law.Other countries have made huge progress in terms of development despite corruption being rampant there. Why do we lag behind?We adopted the form of governance that accepts Parliament as the most sovereign body. But, in reality, the power lies with the chiefs of three major parties. The Parliament rubber stamps whatever they decide. And, they are influenced by certain interest groups. The legislature seeks political parties’ decisions even to follow its procedures. The other most powerful institution as per our constitution is the prime minister. But, in reality, the prime minister always struggles to appease coalition partners. Another important state pillar is the judiciary, which has been weakened by politicisation. Constitutional bodies could have played an important check and balance role but the politicians wanted to use them to serve their interests. With the weakening and non-functioning of state agencies, misrule prevails. In other countries, laws and state agencies work, and therefore they progressed.Is there a viable way to clean up our corrupt system? First the leaders that messed things up and brought the country to this situation should retire. The leaders who led historic political movements have failed to maintain their height. The narrative of ‘there is no hope’ has spread. This will not stop unless the present leadership retires. Things will improve if they voluntarily retire from politics. But they aren’t ready for that.How do you evaluate the present government’s performance after its 100 days in office?I was optimistic at the beginning and expected that they would work differently and instil hope in the people, mainly on good governance. But they gave continuity to the same mistakes they committed in the past. As the two largest parties are in the government, they have a chance to sow hope in the country, but the signs in the past 100 days aren’t encouraging. They deserve credit for the initiative to amend transitional justice related laws and to begin the process to constitute the two TJ bodies. Also, the government successfully restored connection of the Kathmandu Valley with other parts of the country after the devastating floods and landslides.Our major concern is that if this experiment of a government of two largest parties fails, it will raise questions over our system. It won’t be limited to the failure of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, it will be projected as a failure of the system. A number of groups are unhappy with the system the present constitution adopted in 2015. The governing parties’ failure will give them a ground to raise questions over the system, at a time when a large section of the society is fed up with seeing “the same old faces”. Individual leaders’ failure may push our democratic system in a crisis. This is more concerning. At the time of forming this coalition, they said that they joined hands due to the special circumstances of the country. But they didn’t work as per the special needs.You wrote a book entitled Preventing Election Violence Through Diplomacy in 2020 after a comprehensive research on some African countries. Do you see any similarities between politics of Africa and Nepal?In the course of that research, I studied some elected as well as non-elected dictators in Africa and Latin America. The dictators always think along the lines of ‘me and mine’. Instead of strengthening state agencies, they want to turn the agencies in their favour. Over time, some dictators realise they are making one mistake after another and they reach a point where they want to quit. But the coterie that surrounds the leader doesn’t allow him or her to quit. Those who are benefitting from the rule even threaten to kill the dictator if he/she plans to call it quits. Then, the dictators want some external intervention, beyond the tight circle. I found such circumstances in my case studies. It is so unfortunate that I see something similar happening in Nepal. The way a group of people encircle our top leaders and defend even their wrongdoings, it gives me a feeling of deja vu. In our case, some leaders are advised not to quit as a true successor has not been groomed.  \nDuring his term as home minister in the previous Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government that was toppled in mid-July, Narayan Kaji Shrestha, who is also senior vice-chair of the CPN (Maoist Centre), undertook some bold actions. He swung into action on high profile corruption cases such as Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab and cross-border gold smuggling. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal met him on Sunday to ask him of the performance of the new government, the saga around the arrest of Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane.CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, as leader of the main opposition party, convened a joint meeting of opposition parties on Friday. It seems the opposition parties want to solidify their unity against the ruling coalition. What will be the opposition camp’s strategy to build pressure on the government?The government has not been effective in relief distribution, rehabilitation and reconstruction in the areas ravaged by the devastating floods and landslides in the last week of September. Therefore, we convened the meeting to draw the government’s attention to this sorry state of affairs. Second, right since the formation of this government [in mid-July], we suspected this coalition would play a negative role in terms of controlling corruption as the present coalition partners joined hands after being scared of the anti-corruption movement launched by our government [led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal]. It has become imperative to stop the government from doing wrong things and alert the people. Third, there are suspicions that the government is preparing to make it easier for dissident groups in various parties to split political parties by amending the Political Parties Act-2017 through an ordinance. Thus, we basically wanted to press the government to effectively carry out the post-disaster rehabilitation works and stop it from various wrongdoings.Are there specific issues on which the opposition camp wants to build pressure?Effective work on rehabilitation and reconstruction in the disaster-hit areas is our immediate demand. In the long-run, we want to raise the agenda of good governance because developing Nepal as a prosperous country and ensuring social justice should be our central mission. But this isn’t possible without first curbing rampant corruption. Unfortunately, the government is taking a negative approach in this connection.Could you give more specific details where the government went wrong in terms of corruption?To take the latest example, the CPN-UML, which is headed by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, recently accepted a donation of land worth tens of millions of rupees from Min Bahadur Gurung, owner of the country’s largest retail chain, Bhatbhateni Supermarket. The business tycoon has also announced plans to make a building for the party. During our tenure, the government filed a corruption case against him in Lalita Niwas land scam. He was arrested and later the Special Court convicted him of corruption. The land has already been retained as government property. Later, he moved the Supreme Court, where the case is sub judice. Prime Minister Oli had earlier vented his ire for arresting and filing a case against Gurung. We had suspected that he had done something wrong in collusion with Gurung. Oli’s acceptance of the property in the name of donation is unacceptable on political and moral grounds. It is against the good governance drive we launched. You know, we had initiated action in various major corruption scams during our tenure. There are reports that the government is trying to give clean chit to the accused instead of taking the process ahead. Thus the present coalition is working against good governance.In the meeting of the opposition coalition on Friday, Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who was arrested on Saturday, sought support of other opposition parties [based on the information that he was being arrested] arguing that action against him was politically motivated. Will the opposition parties support him?Any case should be independently and fairly investigated. No culprit should be spared. At the same time, no political bias should reflect in the investigation. We can’t say anything about the government agencies’ investigation process. The meeting stressed on the same. It was during my tenure as home minister that the government initiated the investigation against Lamichhane after a supplementary case was registered at the Kaski District Police Office, accusing him of misusing deposits from a Kaski-based cooperative. Later, the parliament formed a special probe committee to investigate. Now the home ministry has taken action against him based on the recommendation of the same panel. We have to cooperate with the government in its investigation. The only thing we can say is that the investigation should be fair and independent. No political party can stand against the investigation itself. How do you see the protests by the RSP cadres following his arrest?They can raise their voice against the possibility of political revenge in the case and demand fair investigation. But they have to cooperate in the investigation and accept the findings. No one can obstruct the investigation just because someone is a politician. The government agencies can’t enforce rule of law if all political parties start protesting against investigations on individuals affiliated to them. A few of the RSP’s concerns are valid too. They argue that the government is working in a discriminatory way. For instance, there are reports with evidence showing involvement of some Nepali Congress and CPN-UML leaders in various cooperatives’ scams. They have asked why the government is not taking any action against them. This is a valid question. The authorities should take action against Congress and UML leaders as well to prove that the government is not discriminatory.Various high-profile corruption cases were prosecuted during your tenure as home minister. You understand if a case has been built on strong or weak grounds. From that perspective, what is your observation of Lamichhane’s case?Rabi ji himself has accepted a level of involvement in the case and said that he is ready to bear the financial liability of the cooperative money invested in the Gorkha Media Network [where he was managing director]. I can comment about the overall case only after the investigation is completed.The fact that over half-a-dozen home ministers since 1990 have been prosecuted in corruption cases shows powerful politicians are involved in corruption. Can this deep-rooted corruption be cleaned up?It is one of the major reasons hindering Nepal’s development. Corruption is promoted by those who are in key state positions. Therefore, we often say our state agencies are influenced by comprador capitalists and there is no investment in productive sectors that would create jobs. Our entire economic ecosystem of creating demand, production, supply and employment has failed. The nexus between powerful politicians, bureaucrats and a handful of business tycoons is promoting activities from where they get huge commissions, and where they get to exploit state coffers. Nepal can’t progress without breaking this nexus. We had taken strong actions in that direction. Unfortunately, the present coalition stopped that process and the comprador capitalists have yet again become active.You must have faced pressure from the political and other quarters when you took action against powerful leaders. Could you give some examples of such pressure?You know, though our party led the government, the other party [Nepali Congress] was the bigger force in the coalition government and actions were taken against the major leaders of the coalition partners. Even those who were affiliated to our party faced actions. So, definitely I faced immense political pressure. But no one could stop me as I was determined to complete my mission of good governance. But a section of people accuse you of sparing individuals close to top leaders and that some individuals were later freed on bail as the cases against them weren’t built as strongly.That is not the case. I pushed the cases despite huge political pressures. But the court later freed them on bail, where we have no role. The court has put some individuals behind bars while some were released. The role of the court is certainly a matter of research. You are right that people wonder why more powerful people aren’t brought under investigation even in big scams such as Bhutanese refugee scam and Lalita Niwas land grab. Media reports indicating powerful individuals’ involvement might be true. However, the government agencies can’t take action against anyone without sufficient evidence. Many have asked why two former prime ministers—Madhav Kumar Nepal and Baburam Bhattarai—were not prosecuted. The Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA) didn’t recommend action against them saying that the policy decisions made in Cabinet meetings don’t fall under its jurisdiction. And, it is still unclear which decisions made in the Cabinet are policy decisions and which aren’t.The secretaries who prepare proposals for Cabinet decisions are held responsible while the ministers who present the same proposals for a decision at the Cabinet meeting and the chief of the Cabinet are not held responsible. People have raised questions about this practice. I think this is a valid question and should be addressed properly. I also believe the ministers who present a proposal for a decision should be held responsible.Also questions were raised over the way the statements of the two prime ministers [Nepal and Bhattarai] were recorded at their homes and in the absence of a government attorney.I take this criticism positively. When I enquired about this episode, police told me that they did so because the CIAA had earlier recorded other former prime ministers at their homes and the police followed the same precedent. In the future, we should be careful. There is one crucial aspect in this case. The two prime ministers weren’t prosecuted in the Lalita Niwas land grab case. But the court has proved that the land deal was wrong. So, it has been recovered as government property. Thus, the decisions taken from the Cabinet meetings [chaired by Nepal and Bhattarai] were wrong. Don’t they need to do public self-criticism?Let’s move on to party politics. As in the past, leaders in your party rigorously discussed the issue of leadership change in Maoist Centre in recent meetings. But nothing happened. Do you see any chance of leadership change in the Maoist Centre?In our recent party meetings, we discussed whether the party’s transformation is more important or leadership change. We need a more unified, transformed and stronger party to implement our party’s agenda in national politics. This is more important. We discussed whether our leadership at present is obstructing this process. Our leadership is ready to work to transform the party, make the organisation stronger and then hand over the leadership. Our chair wants to take the party back to its past strength. We have taken his spirit positively. But this doesn’t mean that Prachanda [Dahal] is irreplaceable.Amid reports about reunification between various Maoist parties, party chairman Dahal and Nepal Communist Party General Secretary Netra Bikram Chand have both spoken on the need for such reunification. Is it happening soon?Our conclusion is that our party can take leadership in carrying out important national tasks. In principle we are in the right direction but the party can’t accomplish the tasks in its present form. So it needs to be made stronger. The ideological and moral grounds of our party have eroded. We have been distanced from downtrodden communities while party leaders have increased proximity with the well-off class. On the other hand, corruption has increased within the party. Therefore, we want to transform the party into a more revolutionary and stronger force. This should be the priority. But even after that, our party’s present strength alone will not suffice to accomplish important national tasks. So we have decided to join hands with more left and Maoist forces. Discussions with various groups for party unity and forging alliances are underway.Reports say the negotiation with the Chand-led party is more positive.The [Chand-led] party made two important decisions from a central committee meeting. They decided to go for party unity and take part in the next general elections. This is an important policy departure of the party. It has increased the possibility of party unity. But we haven’t reached any definite conclusion in this connection. Do you see any chances of forging a working alliance with new forces such as the RSP?The new forces raised an agenda [of good governance] and got good support from the public in elections. But people have already started complaining against them saying that they didn’t work as per their promises. They have started comparing them to traditional forces. The new leaders from whom people had expected a lot have already courted controversy. Having said that, we can’t brush aside the public disenchantment towards major political forces as well.The RSP champions an agenda which is quite different from what the Maoist Centre lobbies for. For instance, the policies the Maoist Centre and the RSP advocate on the federal system are opposite. In this context, can the two parties be long-term allies?The RSP has failed to be honest to the agenda it championed in the elections and to make its political ideology clear. And it has adopted a wrong policy on the federal system. Therefore, at present, we can’t say that we will have a long-term strategic collaboration. There is no reliable basis for that. As far as a working alliance is concerned, it can be with any party. For instance, we have diametrically opposed political viewpoints with the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. They want monarchy while we are strongly for the republic system. They are against federalism while we want a stronger federal system. But we can still forge a working alliance with them on certain agendas.Opposition parties seem quite scared of ordinance on Political Parties Act-2017. There is a need to end the legal void that exists after Congress-Maoist Centre government issued an ordinance three years ago. Is it based on the information about certain provisions that the government is implementing or because it is being brought by bypassing the parliament?It is true that there has been delay in reviving the provisions of the law that were inactivated after introduction of the ordinance at the time. We want that to be done through parliament. Now the government wants to make changes in it because it wants to meet certain vested political interests through it. There are suspicions that the present government leadership is working to split small parties and make the UML the largest in the House of Representatives.Why would Congress help the prime minister bring an ordinance that would make it smaller than the UML?That is why they might be at loggerheads over the issue. What I heard is that both the proposals to arrest Rabi Lamichhane and to issue the ordinance on the Political Parties Act-2017 were discussed in the same Cabinet meeting. The Congress reportedly pushed for the proposal on Lamichhane while the prime minister was for issuing the ordinance as well. It is certain that there is a tug of war between the two sides over the ordinance. \nCentral and eastern parts of Nepal witnessed devastating incidents of landslides and floods last week. At least 244 people were killed, while 19 are still missing. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Basanta Raj Adhikari, director at the Centre for Disaster Studies, Institute of Engineering at Tribhuvan University, to discuss how the country can be better prepared to manage the disasters and minimise damages.Recently we faced disastrous floods and landslides. How do you analyse the losses? Could the damages have been reduced with better preparation and timely response?To begin with, I want to make one thing clear. There is a fundamental difference between a disaster and hazard. Hazard is always natural but it becomes a disaster if there is human involvement. If there is a landslide in a jungle with no human activity, it is a hazard. If a landslide hit a human settlement and it required external involvement to restore the place, then it becomes a disaster. An earthquake is a hazard but it becomes a disaster when man-made structures kill people. As far as the losses from the recent floods are concerned, we could have minimised them with better preparation. For instance, Nakkhu was one of the worst hit areas in the Kathmandu Valley. The river there has drastically narrowed and a human settlement has been developed on the riverbanks in recent years. Human activities in rivers are natural as human civilisations took place on the banks of rivers. But it should be done without disrupting the natural flow of the water. We developed huge settlements encroaching the riverbanks. This invited huge losses. Such activities could have been avoided.As Nepal witnessed record-high rainfalls, were not these losses to be expected? It is true that the country witnessed record rainfalls this season, the highest in the past over five decades. Climate change has caused extreme weather events in recent years. But we can’t blame only natural factors. If you see the images of 2003, it clearly shows that the place where the MediCity Hospital now stands is clearly the floodplain of the Nakkhu river. If you go further downstream, you see a colony. This is how we have encroached riverbanks. We can encroach rivers but it should be done in a scientific way. What is scientific encroachment of rivers?We can model flooding based on the highest volume of water a river can carry. Based on such evidence, we can decide what kind of activities can and cannot be carried out on a riverbank. We can develop settlements but that should be based on scientific evidence and data. Another important concept we should follow is risk sensitive land use planning. Nepal government has already prepared land use maps of all the 753 local units that give vital information about a particular place such as the soil, land capability, risk layer, present land use map, zoning map and cadastral layer. But some people have stopped the authorities from implementing the maps as once they are passed, a land categorised as an agricultural area cannot be converted into commercial land. If that scheme is implemented, one can’t build a house in high flood land. Now the local authorities enforce only the building codes and that don’t include these provisions. That doesn’t inquire whether a building is being built on a riverbank or a landslide susceptible area. In developed countries, those who build in high flood risk areas have to pay more in insurance. Also, areas are categorised based on the chances of occurrence of landslides on the basis of soil type, rock type, geology, distance from a drainage or a road etcetera and structures built there are dealt with accordingly. We are witnessing extreme weather events. In this context, what should we do to prevent more loss in the days ahead?We require an engineering paradigm shift in building infrastructures. The extreme weather patterns have made the data we used to refer to in the past while building infrastructures irrelevant. The data on water levels that were referred to while making a bridge in a river now need to be updated as water levels in our rivers have been rising in recent years. The existing infrastructures can’t withstand that volume of water. We witnessed record rainfalls last week. This can be a reference data for some years. Also, the sedimentation pattern has changed because of human settlements built upstream.Second, we have a generalised rule of building roads across the country. The impact of 200 millilitres of rainfall in Pokhara and rainfall of the same volume in Jhapa is different. As Pokhara experiences rains on a regular basis, the soil in the area can withstand it because it has been weathered by regular rain but the same volume of rainfall can cause more losses in Jhapa because of weak soil there. We thus have to consider the strength of soil while building a structure in a particular place.There is a single road construction method across the country, whether the place is in a high himalayan range, Mahabharat, Shivalik hills or plains. We have to make specific rules for specific places based on the geological and soil structures. The parameters of road construction should be redefined. We are improving the weather forecasting system but now we also need impact-based forecasting to inform the public not only about the volume of likely rainfall but also its likely impact.Where are the problems in our disaster response approach?The Natural Calamity (Relief) Act, 1982 was guided by a fatalistic approach as it saw natural hazards as destined by fate. Then came Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Act, 2017. This change in law is in fact a paradigm shift in disaster management in Nepal. The new law’s perspective is progressive. The new Act changed us from response-centric to preparedness-centric. Legally, we are on a progressive path. But we lag in implementation. We also need to upgrade our skills in handling the situation. Our constitution as well as laws have entrusted local units with the responsibility of handling disaster incidents on their own. The government should make people at the local level aware, and equip and train them for the purpose.Training on some important procedures such as the INSARAG preparedness and response guidelines can be quite effective. Such training and other activities aimed at helping local units to handle disaster incidents should be conducted at the ward levels. “Understanding risk” is an important aspect in disaster management. So common people should be sensitised to the consequences of disaster incidents. You can see people collecting timber from flooded rivers, taking selfies on riverbanks and gathering on a bridge above a roaring river. People at all local wards need to be well-equipped. Those who were swept away at Nakkhu could have been saved if the security personnel and other people there had at least motorboats and life jackets. Our rescue workers now lack even such basic things.Settlements in Nepal’s mountainous and hill areas are located in equally risky zones. What should be done to safeguard them?The mountains in our region are taken as young and the Himalayan range is in the building process. It is also called an active mountain belt. Therefore, we experience frequent earthquakes. Earthquakes cause geomorphological changes. A large number of settlements in Nepal’s hills sit on the debris of old landslides that might have occurred long back. People there should be made aware of the risk and these places be identified. Engineering measures should be taken to make them safe. Scattered populations mainly in the highlands need to be integrated in concentrated settlements.What is the latest status of glaciers and glacial lakes in our mountains?The pace of glacial melting is rising alarmingly because of rising temperature. Earlier, we took only big glacial lakes as threats and gave them more attention but recent incidents showed that even smaller ones pose a threat. The incident of the Thame glacial lake outburst in August showed how the outburst of even a small glacial lake could have a cascading effect. Likewise, the deposits of landslides being piled above 3,000 metres are another serious challenge. Such sediment deposition is increasing in the mountains while there is a huge population downstream. The frequency of cascading hazards has increased, emerging as a major challenge. A landslide blocks a river and when the river breaches the structure built of debris, it causes devastating losses downstream.How can we scientifically prove that the hazards we are seeing were the result of climate change?There has to be scientific evidence to make the link. For instance, the Thame glacial outburst was clearly a climate change-induced hazard as it did not involve human activities. The treeline and snowline are shifting upwards in our mountains. There were no mosquitoes in Mustang until some years ago. Now mosquitos are widespread in the district as temperature there has significantly increased. The crop pattern has changed drastically. Thus we have a number of scientific evidence to show clear signs of climate change in this part of the world. What the government should now do is properly document these climate change-induced incidents following internationally-accepted methods and present them at relevant UN bodies. \nNepal’s economy that has been facing one after another setbacks since the 2015 earthquake has been struggling to bounce back. Last week, two international agencies—the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB)—announced that Nepal’s economy was poised to improve in the upcoming fiscal year. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Nara Bahadur Thapa, former executive director of the research department of Nepal Rastra Bank, to discuss the current state of the national economy. The ADB, in its report last week, anticipated Nepal’s economy to grow by 4.9 percent this fiscal. A few days earlier, a visiting IMF team also painted an improving picture of Nepal’s economy. How do you see these projections?Nepal’s economic growth in the past 2-3 years has remained below 5 percent. But successive governments in their fiscal budgets have been setting the target of 6 to 7 percent growth. Also, the budget this year has aimed for 6 percent growth. In the meantime, two donor agencies have painted an improving picture of our economy. The ADB has anticipated 4.9 percent growth. Also, the IMF’s team that visited Nepal on a fact finding mission has projected better prospects. They expected better yield from the agriculture sector as Nepal is witnessing more rains. Last year, the growth of agriculture was 3 percent. Now they expect the sector may grow by 3.5 to 4 percent and that may lift overall growth. They have cited improvement in tourism and increased energy export as other bases. Based on these grounds, the ADB has projected 4.9 percent economic growth. But even the target of 5 percent growth looks ambitious if you analyse economic data available as of now and the steps taken by government agencies. We have witnessed more rain but that doesn’t always do us good. More rain in the late monsoon often damages paddy at the time of harvest. Second, the heavy monsoon has caused huge losses in our infrastructure such as roads and bridges that are vital to keep the daily lives and trade running. This may impact potential economic growth as some vital highways and roads have been badly damaged. These factors may pose a challenge in achieving the targets set by the government and donor agencies. Another important factor is that the ratio of capital formation to GDP [gross domestic product] is consistently decreasing. It was 33.8 in the fiscal year 2018-19, it decreased to 30.5 in 2019-20, to 29.3 in 2020-21, 29.0 in 2021-22, 25.1 in 2022-23 and 24.5 in 2023-24. How can we expect economic growth when capital formation keeps decreasing. We can’t achieve 6 percent growth without first improving the situation of capital formation. Capital formation in the private sector is on a decline and the government hasn’t been able to boost it. On the other hand, capital expenditure was lower in the past fiscal year in comparison to the previous fiscal. There is no strong sign of increasing capital formation even in the coming year. This is because the government has failed to collect revenue as per its own target. The revenue collection ratio is falling. It has come down to 18 percent of GDP, from 22 percent not so long ago. With this, the government’s funding capacity is continuously declining. It has failed even to fulfil its own duties. For instance, it hasn’t been able to pay health insurance bills and or the contractors. Similarly, credit offtake from private banks to the private sector has not increased from 6 percent. It used to be around 15-16 percent. Also, no substantive initiatives have been taken to improve productivity. For this, government agencies have to cut red tape. The private sector isn’t optimistic. We are talking a lot but not working seriously to lay a strong ground for growth.What are the signs that private investors are pessimistic?There is enough liquidity in the banks, and the interest rate is decreasing, but the private sector is not borrowing. Bankers say there is no demand from the sector. This indicates pessimism. None of the big business houses have launched any big projects in recent times. The government talks a lot about the energy sector but it is not doing power purchase agreements (PPAs) with hydropower project developers. We aren’t doing enough to realise the goal of exporting 10,000MW electricity to India. This shows no serious effort is being made to initiate reforms. The capital market has required some urgent reforms. But the government hasn’t appointed office bearers in the regulatory body for the past seven months. The government hasn’t given permission to issue IPOs and FPOs. Hence, the government is keeping two important sectors—energy and capital market—on hold. All these trends and activities suggest it will be a challenge to achieve even moderate economic growth.You pointed to the policy hurdles but the multilateral agencies have hailed the government for policy reforms. The IMF in its statement has welcomed recent amendments to various laws and the ADB has welcomed “the cautiously accommodative monetary policy”. Don’t these statements reflect reality?While making their positions public, the international agencies follow certain norms and criteria. First, they take macro pictures such as the government’s commitments. They take the pledges made by the government in the investment summit seriously. They think the commitments will be implemented. Second, they don’t want to irk the host country by presenting a bleak picture because they are diplomats. They point out possible pitfalls during bilateral and table talks but present themselves diplomatically while making their official statements public.Remittance, tourism and energy export are taken as major bases for economic growth but all three depend on external factors. How reliable can the projection be?Without trading and increasing exports, we can’t progress economically. We need to export to increase production and create jobs. Export is an engine of economic growth. Anyhow, we must increase exports. About your query, the government should tackle such things by strengthening relations with the countries concerned and devise policies and strategies accordingly.Our economy is increasingly dependent on remittance. How risky is it in the long run?Remittance has become a boon for our economy. It has played a tremendous role in poverty reduction. The first Nepal Living Standard Survey (NLSS) conducted by the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS)—now the National Statistics Office—in 1995-96 showed 42 percent Nepali population living below the poverty line. The latest [fourth] living standard survey has shown the poverty level at 20 percent. It wouldn’t be possible without remittance. Therefore, we can’t undermine the role of remittance in this social transformation. Were not the government’s plans and policies responsible for this achievement?The government role would not have been enough. What government policies have created jobs in Nepal? Are there any schemes worth mentioning? The industrialisation hasn’t increased. It is the industrial sector that creates jobs but the share of the manufacturing sector has come down to 4.87 percent in total GDP. Some years ago, it was nearly 9-10 percent. It shows our economy is being deindustrialised. How can we reduce poverty without providing jobs to the youths? Thus, foreign employment played a vital role in poverty reduction. Second is the role of remittance in maintaining foreign exchange reserves, which is essential to buy things from abroad. We have sufficient foreign exchange reserves because of remittance.Information Technology is now projected as a promising sector in creating jobs and transforming Nepal’s economy. How realistic is this expectation?Four fields can be taken as promising sectors in Nepal—agriculture, tourism, IT and hydropower. The IT sector certainly has a bright future. As our country is land-locked, we have additional challenges in merchandise exports and we can’t be competitive. The IT sector won’t have that barrier so it can be competitive in the international market. But for that the government has to formulate IT-friendly policies. For instance, if a Kathmandu-based Nepali firm wants to sell services in the US, Europe or any other international market, they need liaison offices in those countries. Otherwise, they can’t be competitive and grow. But the government doesn’t provide foreign exchange for them to expand their business abroad.Without this policy reform, Nepalis can’t compete with IT companies from other countries. Similarly, foreign companies need to come and work here so that Nepali youths can learn from them. Foreign banks came to Nepal and Nepali bankers learned. Now Nepali banks are doing good. But our policies aren’t favourable for foreigners interested in setting up IT firms. Also, well-trained IT workers are in shortage. We are progressing but we have to put in extra effort to make transformative changes in this sector.The cooperatives’ scam has emerged as a serious issue. What impact may it cause in the national economy if it’s not resolved soon?The cooperative sector played a vital role in creating financial inclusion in our economy by making 7.3 million people its members. Those who couldn’t do their regular transactions with banks were engaged with cooperatives. If that sector collapses, our state of financial inclusion will decline too. Second, they were major financiers for micro, small and medium enterprises (MSME). Cooperatives are directly linked to entrepreneurship through MSMEs. They played a role in making interest rates of banks more competitive as well as banks and financial institutions were under pressure by the interest rates offered by cooperatives. Now they won’t feel the pressure.In this context, many people may resort to informal transactions. According to the 16th periodic plan, nearly 50 percent of Nepal’s economy is informal. We are under pressure to reduce the portion of the informal economy. But the crisis in the cooperative sector may increase the informal economy as those who were involved in cooperatives, which is a formal sector, are likely to do informal transactions with traders or other individuals.Cooperatives are not well regulated and there are anomalies but they are registered in a government agency, pay taxes, have offices and a record system. They brought people in far-flung villages under a formal channel. If the depositors resort to individual transactions, their money will be unsafe. The constitution accepted them as one of the three pillars—along with the government and the private sector—of the country’s economy. The sector expanded its network where there were no economic activities from the government and private sectors. For instance, the government was providing certain services such as distributing fertilisers, crop seeds, sugar through cooperatives. People will now be deprived of these services. Also, the commercial banks might face complications due to the domino effect of the cooperative scam. For instance, if the government seizes the land put up by a cooperative as a collateral in a bank and sells it to return the deposits, the bank might be in trouble.It is also said that cooperatives were becoming platforms for money laundering. How serious was the problem?Cooperatives didn’t seek a source of money from the depositors while accepting big deposits. They weren’t affiliated to the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) of the central bank and the Anti-Money Laundering/Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). Therefore, there is a problem of money laundering. It can be resolved when they get affiliated with the FIU.What initiatives should be taken to address the problems seen in the cooperative sector?A powerful regulatory authority should be established without delay. The authority should work as a dedicated agency to clear the mess. Then, AML/CFT provisions should be implemented, a credit information centre should be set up and a debt recovery tribunal formed, and deposits guaranteed. The concept of self-regulation isn’t enough. These financial infrastructures are essential. \nThe parliamentary special probe committee formed to investigate cooperatives scam submitted its report last week. The government has already started implementing the report. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with the committee chair Surya Thapa for more insights on the probe’s findings and the anomalies in the cooperative sector they saw during the investigation.After your committee submitted the report on cooperatives scam, people have interpreted its findings in different ways. Why the confusion?Our committee prepared, finalised and endorsed the report unanimously. No member registered any dissent. This is an important point. However, people have interpreted its findings a bit differently. The supporters of [Rastriya Swatantra Party chair] Rabi Lamichhane have tried to make it appear like the report has given him a clean chit. They have selectively taken a certain portion of the report which states that Lamichhane’s involvement couldn’t be formally established in the process of transferring funds from cooperatives to the Gorkha Media Network. But a huge amount of money has been provided to the Gorkha Media Network from various cooperatives against the Cooperative Act 2017, which prohibits investment of cooperative deposits to any company. It is seen that Lamichhane is directly involved in spending the funds collected from the cooperatives. Based on that, we have found chair of the media company Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the then managing director Rabi Lamichhane, directors Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel directly responsible in the misuse of cooperative funds and have asked the government to take action against them as per the existing laws. The aforementioned two aspects are inextricably linked. We didn’t find any evidence of transfer of cooperative funds to Lamichhane’s personal bank account. It is sent to the bank account of the Gorkha Media Network. The KYC form of the Global IME Bank shows that Lamichhane is one of the three holders of the joint account. Any one of the three can issue cheques from the account. The funds invested as loan in the Gorkha Media Network have been transferred to the joint bank account, from where Lamichhane has released money by signing cheques. This is how Lamichhane is directly involved in embezzlement of the cooperative funds. Many argue that as per the cooperative law only those who release money from the cooperatives are held responsible but not those who spend it after it is received at the company. Is that the case?The Cooperative Act 2017 prohibits releasing any loan to a company. But it is sent to the company, where Lamichhane is an owner with 15 percent share and a managing director. And, the money is misused there. An informal statement of GB Rai shows Rs1.20 billion of cooperative deposits has been invested in the media company while our financial analysis shows the amount is Rs654 million. Evidence shows Rs220 million has been directly sent to the media company’s bank account. Depositors have been deprived of their money. Other staff working at the company aren’t responsible but the owners are. They could be charged with cooperative fraud under the Cooperative Act, fraud and duping under the National Penal Code, organised crime cases under the Organised Crime Prevention Act, and money laundering cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act. Some individuals involved with various cooperatives including Roshni Gurung of a Butwal-based cooperative told the committee that they deposited millions of rupees in the bank account of a person named Rabi Lamichhane. Kumar Ramtel said the person named Rabi Lamichhane is none other than the Rastriya Swatantra Party chair. Still, the committee couldn’t establish the link. What is the complication?The flow of the money shows the connection but documents to link the transactions are not available. We didn’t find documents with Lamichhane’s signatures and fingerprints that needed to be submitted to get a loan. All the seven cooperatives run by GB Rai were releasing loans without following due procedure. But we have successfully traced the flow of the money. The loan amount created in the name of Rabi Lamichhane in Butwal and deposited by Roshni Gurung had reached the Gorkha Media Network’s bank account which was jointly operated by GB Rai, Rabi Lamichhane and Chhabilal Joshi. This is an established fact. The committee didn’t find any document showing the flow of cooperative money to his personal account. But that alone is insufficient to give him a clean chit as a huge sum has been sent to the media company’s bank account jointly run by three people including Lamichhane. Another sum from the Supreme Cooperative has been deposited to the bank account of Gorkha Media Network. The bank voucher shows Roshni Gurung/Rabi Lamichhane as depositors. The amount also goes to the same joint account.Now the government has forwarded the report to the investigation agencies. Do you think the agencies can unearth the missing documents?Our committee worked in a different way to regular House committees. We followed methods of investigation just like the police investigation agencies and government’s prosecution agencies do. We recorded the suspects’ statements, took their fingerprints, and got the signatures to authenticate their statements. I believe this is a new practice by a Nepali parliamentary committee. Sufficient evidence has already been gathered in the past as well. While carrying out this task and preparing the 1,124-page document, we have followed the norms and procedures of an investigation body.During the interrogation, many suspects told the committee that they knew nothing and shifted the responsibility to GB Rai, who is on the run. Those from seven cooperatives–Hamro Nayakrishi Multipurpose Cooperatives; Swarnalaxmi; Supreme; Suryadarshan; Sahara; Samanata and Sano Paila and the officials from Gorkha Media Network gave such answers. Their common answer is, “I don’t know about this, GB Rai does.” Many of them might have been trying to evade their responsibility by blaming Rai. The government has failed to produce Rai. Won’t this investigation be incomplete in his absence?Based on its facts and evidence, the investigation report is complete. Yes, 29 suspects including GB Rai are at large. They are believed to be staying abroad. Their statements have not been recorded. But that doesn’t make the investigation incomplete. We have accessed the database of Gorkha Media Network and other cooperative organisations, collected important documents and analysed them. There is no confusion about the money embezzled in the scam. We have determined a total of Rs2.58 billion from various cooperatives has been misused by investing in several organisations including the Gorkha Media Network, Nature Nest, Nature Herbs, Gorkha Group of Investment, Gorkha Ayurved Company—49 people were responsible for these investments, including GB Rai. Of that, Rs654 million has been invested in Gorkha Media Network. A total of Rs8 billion has been embezzled in the seven cooperatives where Rai is involved. So the investigation is complete. During the interrogation, some office bearers of cooperatives claimed they had no role in the transactions as they were dummy officials and GB Rai and some individuals Rai trusted did everything. How convincing is that?The practice of creating dummy officials, fake documents, false marriages and divorces etcetera is rampant in the cooperative sector. In the seven cooperatives GB Rai is at the centre. He has at least one key person in each of these seven cooperatives as chair or manager and carries out everything through them. In some of them, the chairpersons know nothing. The cooperatives don’t follow any norms, rules and regulations of cooperatives. They work just on the basis of orders they get from Rai or his trusted individuals over the phone. Rai gets advice from a California-based individual named Gyan Bahadur Bamjan. The Cooperative Act prohibits an individual from being a member of more than one cooperative but Rai is involved in at least seven cooperatives as a chair, secretary, vice-chair or patron.The government has decided to implement the report. How should the state agencies work to bring good results?The government should immediately initiate action against four persons—Rabi Lamichhane, GB Rai, Chhabilal Joshi and Kumar Ramtel—as the report has found them responsible for misusing cooperative funds. We have also determined the roles and responsibilities of around 1,000 individuals who were chair, vice-chairs, secretaries, treasurers, account chiefs or others who in decision making roles in 40 cooperatives we were tasked to investigate. They should be brought under investigation and their properties should be seized so as to create an environment to return the depositors’ money.Different arrangements need to be made about those who are in judicial custody. They should be released, their all documents including passports seized and they should be kept under surveillance and allowed to take initiatives to return the depositors’ money. The government, while unveiling the fiscal budget, had announced to take initiatives to return deposits upto Rs500,000 by keeping cooperatives’ assets as collateral. This process should be expedited. Likewise, the government should set up an all-powerful regulatory authority. At present, all the 753 local governments, seven provincial governments and the federal government have the regulatory role. That is pointless. Now a strong dedicated regulatory authority should be formed. The Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee is there but it should be made more effective by giving it greater executive powers. When a cooperative is in crisis, the regulatory body should take over its management and fix the crisis just like Nepal Rastra Bank does in the banking sector.What patterns of anomalies did you find in the cooperatives?The fundamental idea of a cooperative is to run by its own members based on self-regulation. But a few board members were found to be using all the authority and misusing the funds while members were unaware about the affairs in the organisations. The board members use most of the resources for their relatives and other closed ones. Annual meetings are organised as picnics and wedding parties. In some cases, annual meetings are fake, audit reports, auditors and signatures, all are fake.In the course of preparing the committee report, I have coined terms like ‘cooperative divorce’ and ‘cooperative marriage’. Divorce and marriage documents are prepared based on the fortune of the cooperatives. There was misappropriation of Rs120 million in a cooperative, where Jyoti Gurung was manager, in 2075 BS. Dhan Raj Gurung, who is Nepali Congress Vice-president, divorced his wife Jyoti in 2076 BS. But, in 2077, Dhan Raj presented himself as a guarantor of a loan to Jyoti. Again in 2080, both of them jointly paid back a loan of Rs9.1 million. This is a bit of a trend in the cooperative sector.Do you think we need to reconsider the basic idea of cooperatives as self-regulated organisations?In the report, we haven’t questioned its principle, need and importance. Cooperative sector is vital for our economy. But the concept of self-regulation as stated in the Cooperative Act 2017 has failed. Now, this sector should be overseen by a strong regulatory body. Still, the idea of self-regulation can be given continuity as the members should be allowed to run the cooperatives on their own but their activities should be strictly regulated by a powerful authority. Moreover, the cooperatives that do big transactions should be regulated by the central bank.Why did the present regulatory bodies fail?There were over 50 lawmakers who proudly identified themselves as office bearers of certain cooperatives. They over-emphasised self-regulation and undermined the role of regulatory bodies. Individuals like GB Rai and other fraudsters benefited from that. Therefore, we recommended stringent laws and a stronger regulatory authority. \nThe country will experience partly to generally cloudy skies in the hilly areas on Monday, while the rest of the country will remain partly cloudy to mostly clear.
