Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nOver three months after its pledge to return the up to Rs500,000 to small depositors in troubled cooperatives, the government has yet to act on its promise, citing the need to finalise guidelines to implement the decision.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024/25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors. “To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” the then finance minister Barsha Man Pun had announced while reading out the budget in Parliament.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024/25 in the federal parliament, Pun also outlined plans to address the problems faced by cooperative institutions.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, two months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to facilitate the refunds.“We are still discussing the details of the guidelines,” Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, spokesperson for the ministry, told the Post. “We are discussing whether to use cooperatives operators’ property as collateral or explore other alternative solutions.”Pun, who as then finance minister unveiled the budget for the current fiscal year, had also committed to setting up a regulatory framework consistent with principles and policies governing cooperatives.He had also emphasised the need for a regulatory body to oversee savings and credit cooperatives and to facilitate their mergers.While the government is still finalising the refund guidelines for small depositors, an eight-point agreement was reached between the government and cooperatives victims on Monday.Cooperative victims had earlier resumed protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to earnestly implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year and reached a seven-point agreement with then minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation Ranjita Shrestha.When this agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of protest. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with another minister, Balram Adhikari, who headed the cooperative ministry at the time.Following Monday’s new eight-point agreement where the government has again promised to return the savings, the cooperatives victims suspended their 108-day protest.The eight points were agreed upon during a discussion between representatives from the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperatives Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary of the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation.According to the agreement, a committee has been formed with the Sub-Registrar of the Co-operative Department as coordinator. It has a mandate to continuously assist in collection and analysis of data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, says Pal Singh KC, a victim of Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative, will represent them on the committee. “The committee will monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives and collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “After analysing the collected data, the committee will present its findings and recommendations to the department.”The committee will conduct a financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them into well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and those in serious trouble, and recommend necessary actions. A review meeting will be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to review the committee’s progress.Similarly, the agreement reaffirms the government commitment to implement the previous agreements made with cooperative victims. Bhatta, the ministry spokesperson, claimed this time things would be different. “The difference is that this time cooperative victims themselves will also be involved in the process, so the agreement will be implemented,” Bhatta said.Likewise, Kushluv KC, chair of the agitating National Campaign for Protection of Cooperatives Depositors, also is optimistic.“This time, the government has promised to start the committee’s work within two days of the agreement,” KC told the Post. “We have also agreed to include police officers in the committee work in order to enhance our study.”“We are also eagerly looking forward to the report of the parliamentary special probe committee constituted to investigate the cooperatives scam,” he added. The parliamentary special probe committee formed under coordination of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa completed its three-month tenure on September 7 and has been given a 15-day extension. \nThe parties in the ruling coalition have agreed to hold extensive discussions with regard to making amendments in the constitution in line with the seven-point agreement reached between the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1.The Congress-UML agreement outlined that amendments would only proceed after consulting key political parties and stakeholders.At a meeting held at the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar on Monday evening, leaders from the ruling alliance, including those who supported the coalition without joining the Cabinet, emphasised the need for accommodating all the sides in the constitution amendment process. Ranjita Shrestha, chairperson of Nagarik Unmukti Party, said that the parties in the ruling alliance agreed to take any definite move only after consulting all the political forces. “There was consensus to hold comprehensive discussions with all parties regarding the amendments. The meeting focused on reaching a conclusion only after understanding viewpoints from all the sides,” she said. \"Many groups were dissatisfied when the constitution was enacted, and there’s an emphasis on addressing these concerns to improve it.\"The leaders also discussed the ways to improve the government functioning amidst growing criticism from opposition parties, particularly the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. “There was a focus on how to improve government delivery and how the ruling coalition can move forward with a unified stance,” Mahesh Kumar Bartaula, chief whip of ruling UML, said. He added that the government’s common minimum programme would be based on the seven-point agreement made at the time of government formation.Bartaula shared that there will be weekly meetings among the ruling parties to ensure smooth coordination and progress in the governance and coalition.Earlier on Sunday, the ruling parties formed a four-member taskforce to draft the common minimum programme of the coalition government.Leaders from the two parties including Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba at a meeting at the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar to form the taskforce to outline the policies and programmes to guide the government functioning.Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Nepali Congress; and deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the UML are in the taskforce. \nAs festival season nears, onion prices have risen over the past month and could climb even further, according to market analysts. The price of the major kitchen staple has increased due to the rise in India, Nepal’s key source market.According to Indian media reports, onion prices have risen to over IRs70 per kg in retail in Delhi and IRs80 per kg in other regions.With retail onion prices now hovering over 47 percent higher than a year ago, India’s Union Food Minister Pralhad Joshi flagged off vans of two government cooperatives—the National Cooperative Consumer’s Federation (NCCF) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation—to sell onions at IRs35 per kg.The Indian central government typically steps in when prices of onions, a politically sensitive commodity, start to climb. Every year, in the latter part of the monsoon, the onion crop gets damaged in key producing areas, leading to scarcity and price rises.The price increase in India has a direct impact on Nepal, which is heavily dependent on onion imports from its southern neighbour.Onions are cultivated three times a year in India—in monsoon, winter and summer.According to the comparative price index of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of onion has increased by 20.32 percent within a month and by 71.29 percent within a year.On Monday, the wholesale price of onion in the Kalimati market was Rs128 per kg, compared to around Rs70 per kg a year ago.In retail, it costs Rs170 to Rs180 per kg.“The price has increased in India, which automatically affects the price in the Nepali market,” said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association. “The price will start to cool down once the new harvest starts arriving in the Nepali market,” he said, adding that it would take a month for the new harvest to come in. “Until then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs130 per kg.” Traders say that in retail, onion may reach Rs200 per kg due to customs duties and other taxes.“In India, onions cost around Rs65 per kg, and after adding Rs45 customs duty, it costs Rs110, excluding transportation,” said Baniya.For consumers, price hikes on essential commodities, especially when the festival is around the corner, are a major concern.“Without onion, it is impossible to prepare many dishes,” said Banshi Acharya, a resident of Ravi Bhawan, who was buying vegetables in the Kalimati market on Saturday.“The price of daily essentials increases even with mere rumours. This shows a failure in the government’s ability to control market malpractices.”Onion arrivals in the Kalimati market have declined by 31.77 percent within a month. The market received 24 tonnes of onion on Friday.Onion imports declined by 68.14 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 51,544 tonnes of onions worth Rs2.15 billion in the last fiscal year.The Indian government banned onion exports in December last year and lifted the ban in May. However, India imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which caused a price hike in onions.Despite the five-month ban, the supply of onions in the Nepali vegetable market remained stable as onions continued to arrive through informal channels, traders say. “Despite the ban, prices stayed stable due to rampant smuggling.”In the last fiscal year, after the government imposed a 13 percent VAT on vegetables, including onions and potatoes, there were substantial price differences for onions in Nepal and India, which fuelled informal cross-border trade of onions, according to several reports. Nepal Police seized thousands of tonnes of onion smuggled in through the southern border, the reports say.Prices, eventually, started to cool down as smuggling surged.Even though Nepali customs officials regularly inspect the border, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly on motorbikes.According to research titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west.“India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher,” the research says. \nThe ambassadorial recommendations have become controversial once again. Be it the failure to meet the criteria of inclusiveness or the insensitive and superficial responses made by the proposed envoys, the ambassadorial nomination for 17 countries have landed in troubled waters.Taking an exception to the nomination, the parliamentary hearing special committee on Monday summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and inquired why the government failed to meet the constitutional criteria and make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government recommended 17 ambassadors and recalled some. But the recommendations have failed to catch the spirit of inclusiveness and have flouted the mandatory constitutional provision. Meanwhile, the parliament hearing special committee has already completed the hearing of 13 proposed envoys.During the meeting on Monday, several cross-party lawmakers criticised the ambassadorial recommendations.Even ruling party lawmakers have criticised the ambassadorial appointment and complained about it with Foreign Minister Rana.The government has failed to recommend ambassadors from Muslim, Madheshi and Dalit communities, said Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, a Nepali Congress lawmaker. “I request the government to nominate ambassadors from underrepresented communities as per the spirit of constitution while filling the remaining vacancies,” Karki said.Meanwhile, Mahesh Bartaula of CPN-UML said that they have failed to uphold the spirit of the constitution despite leading a strong government of two major parties. “We have also failed to assess and review the performance of the serving ambassadors,” Bartaula said.Bartaula then asked a series of rhetorical questions.“Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs keep the record of ambassadors about what they commit in the committee and what they actually do?” he said. “Does the foreign ministry have a record of such statements? Why do we recall ambassadors after every change in the government? And what commitment do we make that we will uphold the constitutional provisions?”Likewise, Dol Prasad Aryal of Rastriya Swatantra Party reminded the minister about the constitutional provision on ambassadorial appointment and about complaints registered against the proposed ambassadors. “As soon as the government changes, we recall the ambassadors,” said Aryal. “Such decisions definitely undermine diplomatic conduct. An ambassador should complete his or her full term.”Moreover, Anand Prasad Dhungana of Nepali Congress, Ishowari Gharti of UML, Prakash Adhikari of Janata Samajbai Party, Bhagawati Neupane of UML and other lawmakers criticised the ambassadorial recommendation for failing to uphold the spirit of the constitution.After hearing criticisms from lawmakers, Foreign Minister Rana admitted that the ambassadorial recommendation could not become inclusive but committed that the government will make it more inclusive in the days to come.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof. Dr. Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof. Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr. Shail Rupakheti (Germany) as ambassadors.The recommendation of Kanta Rijal to Australia was later changed and recently the government has recommended the name of Chitra Lekha Yadav to the post. The incumbent foreign secretary Sewa Lamasal has been recommended for EU and Brussels but both nominations have not been sent to the parliamentary hearing special committee.Similarly, Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Dr. Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof. Dr. Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr. Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr. Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan) are among those recommended as ambassadors.“The government’s policy is to take maximum benefit of the ambassador’s experience and expertise,” Rana said. “And we tried our best to make the ambassadorial nomination inclusive as per the spirit of the constitution… Those clusters which have failed to get a chance this time will be accommodated next time.”While responding to the queries of lawmakers, Rana said the government has been conducting its foreign relations and diplomacy in favour of national interest.“The government is committed to advancing Nepal’s national interest through ambassadors and diplomatic missions,” Rana said.Rana added that the Cabinet has recently decided to ensure women participation in every government delegation that has more than one delegate. \nVictims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative waved black flags at Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who is also former home minister, in Pokhara of Kaski district on Tuesday. Lamichhane came to Pokhara to attend the party’s provincial meeting at the Galaxy Banquet in Birauta, Pokhara.The protesters displayed placards with slogans against Lamichhane outside the event venue, accusing politicians of protecting key suspects of the cooperative frauds.On October 5 last year, police filed a fraud case at Kaski District Court against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of the Gorkha Media Network, along with 18 other former and current directors and employees of the cooperative, accusing them of being involved in embezzling over Rs1.1 billion from Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Co-operative.During the initial investigation, the roles of former home minister Lamichhane and Dipesh Pun, son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, were reportedly viewed as suspicious. To further the inquiry, Kiran Bajracharya, then Chief of the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police, deployed a team led by inspectors to assist substantively with the case.A diffusion notice against GB Rai was issued on January 23 as he remains at large.Thousands of cooperative victims have been protesting in various parts of the country for months as scores of cooperatives failed to return the depositors’ money. As the cooperative scam emerges as a national crisis, a special parliamentary enquiry committee has been investigating the matter for over a period of three months.Former ministers and lawmakers including RSP chair Lamichhane and chiefs of several cooperatives are under investigation. \nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) has committed to expanding its investment in Nepal. The Corporation invested 100 million dollars in Nepal last year.In a meeting held at the Ministry of Finance with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, IFC’s South Asia Regional Director, Imad N. Fakhoury, informed officials about the expansion of the investment in Nepal, according to a press note issued by the Ministry.According to the Ministry, Fakhoury stated that IFC’s support is aimed at enhancing competitiveness in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector and the finance market, while also improving financial inclusion, creating jobs, and supporting Nepal’s climate goals.“IFC’s primary focus is on the Greenhouse, creating more employment opportunities and economic involvement in Nepal,” he said during the meeting.Finance Minister Paudel urged the IFC team to further expand their investment, noting that Nepal's economy requires greater investment for its improvement. \nEvery day, 20 people took their own lives in the last fiscal year in Nepal.It is like a minibus carrying 20 passengers plunging into a swollen river every day, and all of them dying.The country, which was ranked 7th globally for suicide rates by the World Health Organization in 2014, has recently seen an alarming rise in deaths by self-harm.What concerns experts more is that farmers, students, housewives, and unemployed youths are taking their own lives at an alarming rate.According to data provided by Nepal Police, 7,223 people ended their lives in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the two previous fiscal years (2021-022 and 2022-023) altogether 13,823 people killed themselves. Of these, over 40 percent were farmers (5,556), followed by 15.4 percent of students (2128), and 11.6 percent housewives.Although the records show that over 40 percent of those who took their lives were from farming backgrounds, the specific reasons behind these extreme actions remain unclear, say police officials. “Whatever the causes might be, the suicide rates among farmers, students, housewives, and unemployed youths are very high compared to other groups,” said Dr Ashish Dutta, a senior superintendent of police. “A detailed study is needed to find the actual causes behind these suicides.”The National Sample Census of Agriculture 2021-22, carried out by the National Statistics Office, shows that around 62 percent of the county's total population is engaged in agriculture, contributing about a quarter of the nation’s GDP and employing two-thirds of the population. Experts say that since farmers make up such a large portion of Nepal’s population, it is obvious that a significant number of suicides would come from this sector.Mental health experts point to factors such as the burden of debt, crop failure, and rising production costs, including labour costs, among others, as potential reasons for the rise in farmer suicides.Likewise, academic failure, unfulfilled ambitions, love failures, and adjustment problems in new environments, among others, could be the reasons for the rise in suicide rates among students. Similarly, family disputes, domestic violence, and several other factors are linked to to the high suicide rate among housewives.Experts agree that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason but rather due to a complex mix of factors, including the rising cost of living and the struggle to meet basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.“Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and society at large,” said Dr Sangeeta Kaushal Mishra, director general at the Department of Health Services. “The issue is not just the number of suicides but also the number of those who attempted to end their lives.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment, and the promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is a key indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to the SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reducing the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 people by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the Covid pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prevention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nThe department of transport management has decided to include a photo and QR code on the receipt issued to those who pass the driving test conducted at the provincial level.Following the department's decision to issue smart cards only in emergency cases, Uddhavraj Rijal, chief of the department, said that the new system would be implemented soon. He shared that meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, the province governments decided to use the photo and QR code on the receipts provided to the people who passed trial.The printing of smart cards has been halted as the state is unable to manage their distribution permanently. The use of QR-coded receipts will also simplify checks for traffic police. Software issues have caused a halt in smart license printing since the last week of Shrawan.Rijal said that the smart cards would still be issued to individuals with visas who are guaranteed to travel abroad. “The traffic police are working to integrate the use of the Nagarik App as well. If implemented, the new system will first take effect in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur,” an official at the department said under anonymity.Currently, 5,000 to 6,000 candidates pass driving tests through 43 centres across the seven provinces each week, with more than 1.7 million citizens waiting for their smart licenses.The department also plans to require candidates to pay for the QR-coded receipt with their photo before the driving test. This measure aims to curb the growing problem of fraudulent candidates taking tests on behalf of others. “It will also prevent people from using someone else’s receipt and driving illegally,” said Rijal. \nThe recent Supreme Court ruling, which mandates an additional 20-metre buffer zone besides the Kathmandu Valley’s major rivers like Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohara, has of late become a piping hot topic of discussion. While intended to facilitate river management and protect the environment, the ruling ignores the other side of the picture: Its socio-economic repercussions for thousands of landowners and households who will be affected by the verdict. To add to their woes, Kathmandu’s Mayor Balendra Shah has rolled up his sleeves to implement the mandate without consulting even his fellow Kathmandu Metropolitan City office bearers, let alone other stakeholders. He appears hell-bent on implementing the verdict.Shah’s form is in keeping with his reputation of bullheadedness once he decides on a course of action. The recent ruling only appears to bolster his desire to remove riverside settlers and slum areas under the guise of cleaning up Kathmandu. Although Shah uncharacteristically softened his stance through his Facebook post on Sunday, insisting that no homes would be demolished in the process, it happened only after widespread criticism. But then the whole post is rather long-winded, intended more at criticising the federal government and his many critics there rather than reassuring the public of his commitment to protecting their land and property. The consequences of this verdict cannot be overlooked. Rivers and springs run through much of the valley’s prime lands, where many have poured their hard-earned money. They have legally purchased land and built their homes. With the Supreme Court decision, these homeowners fear their property ownership may no longer be valid. Moreover, the government has a poor track record of compensating displaced people. The issue of 188-ropani land between Gokarna and Guhyeshwari Ghats highlighted is a telling example, as landowners there have yet to be compensated for the loss of their land due to the Bagmati River changing its course. The Supreme Court’s decision to mandate the additional buffer zone also raises questions about the judiciary’s decision-making. Why does the apex court have to rule by going well beyond what the petitioner has asked, be it in relation to the tenure of police officers or the size of the buffer lands besides major rivers? In this particular case, Shah has wielded the court decision like a wrecking ball. The court must be more circumspect in cases where judicial meddling can, instead of helping, further complicate things and disturb social harmony. (It must also be rather embarrassing for the justices as they are now expected to ‘vacate’ the dubious ruling.) Coming back to Shah, as Kathmandu’s mayor, he has some major achievements under his belt. Kathmandu is perhaps cleaner now than at any other time in our living memory. The roads are well-lit. Successive measures had failed to pick even these low-hanging fruits. Kudos to Shah. Where he gets it wrong, again, is in his lack of consultations on even vital matters. This does not mean he should start listening to everyone and veer off his priorities. But as the city’s mayor, he should be mindful that the steps he is taking are in the interest of the people who call Kathmandu home. Something Shah has repeatedly ignored is the fact that the capital city Kathmandu is home not just to its long-time residents but also millions of temporary residents from all over the country. It’s a clear choice between short-term popularity and long-term staying power as a leader.  \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nDuring the 2020-21 Covid-19 pandemic, the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) reached unprecedented highs despite the broader economic challenges. A speculative mania ensued in the market, driving the stock price of assets to all-time highs. The aftermath of the pandemic, compounded by weak domestic demand, the introduction of a margin lending cap and the Nepal Rastra Bank's benchmark interest rate hikes, made 2022 one of the most challenging years for the stock market. By mid-2022, investor sentiment hit rock bottom, weighed down by a persistently bleak economic outlook, leaving inexperienced investors with significant losses.After two years of dismal performance, the pendulum has swung back as investors rallied around a more optimistic narrative: An accommodative monetary policy, perception of stable political alliance, availability of credit, and appointment of a market-friendly finance minister could stimulate growth, fueling economic recovery and market gains. NEPSE has experienced a remarkable 45 percent surge in less than two months since the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress agreed to form the government in July.Particularly noteworthy is the revival of familiar narratives and asset price speculation in the market, indicating renewed confidence among the market participants. A consistent pattern observed in every bull market cycle is that optimism overtakes rational judgment, and several shifts occur in the market, such as asset price increase, greed surpassing fear, the fear of missing out overriding the fear of losing money, and risk aversion and caution dissipation. With the sharp rise in asset prices since July, investors are again engaging in opportunistic buying with the anticipation of selling at an elevated price, speculating on the stock prices of various companies, and engaging in risky bets to harness profit and recover from the prior cycle losses.This sentiment resonates profoundly with the cyclical nature of financial markets, where we witness recurring cycles that share striking similarities. As Mark Twain famously remarked, “History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” These narratives follow well-known patterns that aren’t identical, particularly those related to human behaviour. The market rhymesThe recent bullish sentiment in Nepal's financial market reflects the familiar patterns from the prior bull market cycles. Analysing market participants’ behaviour dominated by emotional biases provides an understanding of these market patterns. As co-founder of Oaktree Capital and investor Howard Marks indicated in his memo \"Bull Market Rhymes,\" the stock market is heavily influenced by investor sentiments, leading to cycles of excessive optimism and pessimism. When optimistic narratives dominate, prices often spike far above the intrinsic value of assets, only to plummet when reality fails to meet expectations. This pattern persists, with prices oscillating between overvaluation and undervaluation, when market behaviour is primarily driven by emotional decision-making. Financial euphoria is often attributable to the remarkably short-lived nature of market participants’ memory, leading to the swift forgetting of past market crashes. In recent weeks, investors haven't truly forgotten about the 2022 market losses; instead, they find themselves balancing the knowledge of prior cycle lessons and prudence against the greed of wealth. The desire to get rich and recover from past losses tips the scale in speculating asset prices and riding the tide. Prudence, caution and risk aversion are often sidelined in this pursuit. As a result, legitimate concerns are overlooked once asset prices gain momentum. First movers gain a distinct advantage in the renewed resurgence in the market and often generate good fortune, owing more to luck than skill. The momentum attracts new investors to join the ride, and the self-reinforcing cycle intensifies, galvanising many more to join the market frenzy. The inflow of new capital from new entrants elevates the market prices even further, discarding investment principles and replacing them with new ones developed to rationalise the frenzy.As historical cycles suggest, these influences inevitably subside, typically when optimism without fundamental support wanes. The past cycle suggests investors experience pressure when the new capital pool dries up. In due course, investors conclude that the rally drivers may not be as valuable as they perceived, and the fear of capital loss ensues, morphing into the terror of falling asset prices. Investors often forget that collective behaviours influence these market patterns and overestimate their ability to make the right decisions in the new cycle. While resisting the temptation of bull market psychology is not easy, holding on to a few principles may help market participants. Principles to followWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, emphasises the importance of extraordinary patience for investment success. As Amor Towles quotes in his book, A Gentleman in Moscow, “If patience wasn't so easily tested, then it would hardly be a virtue.” Resisting the temptation to act often exposes investors to the wrath of bubbles. The ability to watch paint dry usually helps investors see through the bubbles and avoid betting vast sums of money on the verge of excessive optimism. The rare voice of reason is barely heard when the fear of missing out galvanises the market frenzy. Preparing to be lonely when most market participants believe the frenzy helps investors avoid the bubble traps. Some opportunities are lost, but it hardly exposes us to financial ruin. Behavioural patterns have parallels in every cycle, and people who learn from historical cycles understand that the rally is not as mysterious as sizable market participants claim it to be. Even prudent investors may not detect the onset of the next bubble and predict turning points; those who learn from history recognise the rhythms of financial markets. These behavioural patterns are hard to identify and difficult to resist. Hopefully, some of these lessons will help us to avoid participating in the next bubble.  \nThis year, from a pool of around 68,000 Nepali civil servants spread over three tiers of the government, not one was eligible for the annual ‘Best Civil Servant’ award. In fact, for the eighth year running, no one has received this coveted honour. Perhaps the criteria are too stringent. To be eligible, a civil servant must have served in a permanent position for at least 15 years. The concerned individual should have achieved 100 percent performance evaluation for the past five years, not faced any departmental action in the past 15 years, and not have unresolved financial discrepancies in the year of evaluation. And yes, they must also have regularly submitted property details. For one person to meet all these criteria is nigh on impossible. It does not help that at times even when the ‘best employee’ has been selected, the person was later found to be undeserving. For instance, the award’s first recipient, Surya Prasad Gautam, was later dragged into controversy for supposedly grading his own wife's Public Service Commission examination papers. This makes the task of the selection panel harder still: they don’t want to get it wrong and later be mocked and trolled. This failure to find an honest and hard-working civil servant coincides with a declining interest in the Nepali civil service in general. In the past, many young college graduates saw civil service as a stable and long-term source of income and employment. The salaries were healthy, often with the prospect of bonus. Generous retirement and pension schemes were added lures. But very few young graduates these days are interested in the civil service that is often far less attractive in terms of pay and perks compared to the private sector. More than that, the allure of foreign education and jobs is just too strong. The Nepali state officials have also done a pathetic job of attracting bright youngsters to civil service. The Federal Civil Service Bill remains stuck in Parliament. As things stand, it is hard to match the incentives on offer with the growing aspirations of today’s youngsters. Likewise, there is a big dearth of provincial and local level employees, with most civil servants reluctant to serve outside of Kathmandu and a handful of urban centres. It is getting harder to find decent civil servants, let alone award-worthy ones. A wholesale reform of the Nepali civil service is thus vital. But that seems a long way off. Although the three tiers of government are now in place, the state machinery is heavily centralised. Corruption and inefficiency hobble nearly all public offices. Nor are today’s young job-hunters looking for lifetime jobs where, moreover, the only way they can climb up the career ladder is by sucking up to their bosses and political leaders rather than through the quality of their work. Unless there is a thorough clean-up of the image of Nepal’s civil service—in terms of better pay and perks, clean and clear criteria for promotion, the autonomy to work free from political pressure, to name a few desired reforms—just giving out gongs won’t serve the purpose either of motivating employees or attracting qualified ones. Meanwhile, it may not be a bad idea to shelve this award unless a system is in place to produce the kind of civil servants worthy of getting it.    \nLeaders from the ruling parties say that during their meeting on Monday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office.Deputy Speaker Rana Magar had landed in controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role.On February 26 last year, Deputy Speaker Rana Magar wrote a letter to the US Embassy requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She has been facing pressure to step down after the letter was leaked two months ago.In the letter, Rana Magar requested the embassy to expedite interview dates for six people, including herself. The others named in the letter were Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung. Magar had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th Commission on the Status of Women session, scheduled in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. “Writing a letter to the embassy to reschedule visa interviews is not something someone in her position should do,” Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, told the Post. “But whether the allegation is sufficient to warrant her removal is still up for debate.” After the UML’s main partner in the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress, became positive on the proposal of Prime Minister Oli, the fringe parties in the coalition decided to align with the decision of the two largest parties, according to a ruling party leader who was present in the meeting. “Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar, saying that her conduct was incompatible with her position,” Abdul Khan, a Janamat Party lawmaker who was present at the meeting, told the Post. “By Wednesday, the proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar will be filed in Parliament.” Khan added that she is likely to be removed from her post by the end of this (Nepali) month (mid-September). But Chief Whip of the Congress and the UML, Shyam Kumar Ghimire and Mahesh Bartaula, respectively, denied that a proposal to remove the Deputy Speaker will be filed in Parliament on Wednesday.During the ruling parties’ meeting on Monday, Prime Minister Oli had discussed various issues related to Parliament and the role of ruling parties’ lawmakers. Among the issues discussed was the Deputy Speaker’s questionable conduct, Bartaula says. “Although the ruling parties only discussed the issues related to the Deputy Speaker, the way Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker behaved in Tuesday’s House session has pushed the ruling parties to resolve the matter decisively,” Bartaula, the chief whip of the UML, told the Post. “Opposition parties have used some media to spread false information about the government’s actions. Since the issue has been raised we will resolve it soon.”After months of heated debate, the ruling parties are now considering that Deputy Speaker Magar’s conduct is not compatible with her office, in line with Article 91 of the Constitution of Nepal, and have urged her to step down from her position. Article 91 (6)(c) of the Constitution stipulates that the office of the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives shall become vacant if a resolution is passed by a majority of two-thirds of the total number of the then members of the House of Representatives that his or her conduct is not compatible with the office. The ruling parties command a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which is needed to remove the Deputy Speaker. In the 275-strong assembly, ruling parties need the support of 184 lawmakers to achieve a two-thirds majority. The Congress (88), UML (77 excluding the Speaker), Janata Samajbadi Party (7), Janamat Party (6), Loktantrik Samjbadi Party (4), and Nagarik Unmukti Party (4) together have 186 lawmakers, which is more than enough to secure the two-thirds majority. Although the process planned by the parties to remove the Deputy Speaker resembles impeachment, the constitution does not specifically term it as such.Ekram Giri, the spokesperson of the House, said should the ruling parties file a complaint against the Deputy Speaker, it must be supported by the signatures of one-fourth of the total strength of the House, or 69 of the 275 lawmakers. If Magar is removed, it would be the first time in Nepal's parliamentary history that a sitting Deputy Speaker is ousted with a two-thirds majority, says Damannath Dhungana, a former Speaker of the House. The proposal to remove Magar has again heated up the country’s political landscape. During the House meeting on Tuesday, the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), on whose quota Magar was elected Deputy Speaker, criticised the ruling parties’ plan as unacceptable. The RSP has been staunchly defending Deputy Speaker Magar. The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the issue with the ulterior motive of ousting her.The RSP claims that the Congress and UML want to replace Magar with one of their own lawmakers after losing their majority in the Constitutional Council. In addition to her roles in the legislature, Magar is a member of the council, which elects the chiefs and members of constitutional bodies including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Council, headed by the prime minister, includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the chair of the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, and the Deputy Speaker. Currently, the UML, which leads the coalition government with the Congress and some fringe parties, holds two seats on the Constitutional Council—Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire (who mandatorily stepped down from party positions upon appointment). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is equally represented in the council, with Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the opposition leader, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal as members.RSP leaders say that removing Deputy Speaker Rana Magar would allow the ruling coalition to appoint one of their own lawmakers to secure a majority in the council, even if the Chief Justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments. “It is unacceptable for the political parties to conspire to remove the Deputy Speaker using majority power,” Santosh Pariyar, the chief whip of the RSP, said in Parliament on Tuesday. “The way two of the largest parties intend to move ahead will undermine the principles of democracy.”Former Speaker Dhungana, speaking to the Post, says, “The accusation against the Deputy Speaker will have political and social implications; I hope the ruling parties calculate these correctly before making such a momentous decision.” \nUkraine targeted the Russian capital on Tuesday in its biggest drone attack so far, killing at least one and wrecking dozens of homes in the Moscow region and forcing around 50 flights to be diverted from airports around Moscow.Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, said it had destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian attack drones as they swarmed over the Moscow region, which has a population of more than 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions.At least one person was killed near Moscow, Russian authorities said. Three of Moscow's four airports were closed for more than six hours and almost 50 flights were diverted.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the drone attack was another reminder of the real nature of Ukraine's political leadership, which he said was made up of Russia's enemies.\"There is no way that night time strikes on residential neighbourhoods can be associated with military action,\" said Peskov.\"The Kyiv regime continues to demonstrate its nature. They are our enemies and we must continue the special military operation to protect ourselves from such actions,\" he said, using the expression Moscow uses to describe its war in Ukraine.Kyiv said Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, had attacked it overnight with 46 drones, of which 38 were destroyed.The drone attacks on Russia damaged at high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, residents told Reuters.A 46-year-old woman was killed and three people were wounded in Ramenskoye, Moscow regional governor Andrei Vorobyov said.Residents said they awoke to blasts and fire.\"I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,\" Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. \"The window got blown out by the shockwave.\"Georgy, a resident who declined to give his surname, said he heard a drone buzzing outside his building in the early hours.\"I drew back the curtain and it hit the building right before my eyes, I saw it all,\" he said. \"I took my family and we ran outside.\"The Ramenskoye district, some 50 km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, has a population of around a quarter of a million people, according to official data.More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia's Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia's defence ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there.As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has taken the war to Russia with a cross-border attack into Russia's western Kursk region that began on Aug. 6 and by carrying out increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory.DRONE WARThe war has largely been a grinding artillery and drone war along the 1,000 km (620 mile) heavily fortified front line in southern and eastern Ukraine involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production and assembly to attack targets including tanks and energy infrastructure such as refineries and airfields.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants \"terrorism\" and has vowed a response.Moscow and other big Russian cities have largely been insulated from the war.Russia itself has hit Ukraine with thousands of missiles and drones in the last two-and-a-half years, killing thousands of civilians, wrecking much of the country's energy system and damaging commercial and residential properties across the country.Ukraine says it has a right to strike back deep into Russia. However, Kyiv's Western backers have said they do not want a direct confrontation between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about Tuesday's attacks. Both sides deny targeting civilians.Tuesday's attack follows drone attacks Ukraine launched in early September chiefly targeting Russia's energy and power facilities.Authorities in the Tula region, which neighbours the Moscow region to its north, said drone wreckage had fallen onto a fuel and energy facility but that the \"technological process\" of the facility was not affected. \nJunior doctors in West Bengal continue strike in protest of murdered trainee doctor despite court deadline, demanding improved hospital security.\nUkraine on Tuesday struck Moscow and western Russia in one of its biggest ever drone attacks, killing at least one woman, wrecking dozens of homes and forcing the closure of major airports in the capital, Russian officials said.Ukraine launched swarms of attack drones over the world’s biggest nuclear power. Russia said it destroyed at least 20 over the Moscow region, which has a population of over 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions.Three of Moscow’s four airports were closed for air traffic following the attacks, Russia’s aviation authority Rosaviatsia said. A major road leading to the capital was partially closed.The drone attacks damaged at least two high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, Moscow’s governor Andrei Vorobyov said.A 46-year-old woman died and three people were injured in Ramenskoye, Vorobyov said. He added that 43 people were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres.Social media videos showed flames bursting out of windows of a multi-storey residential building, saying that dozens of flats were damaged in the Ramenskoye district.“I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,” Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. “The window got blown out by the shockwave.”The Ramenskoye district, some 50 kms (31 miles) southeast from the Kremlin, has a population of around quarter a million of people, according to official data.More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia’s Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia’s defence ministry said.

However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide. Experts say snow leopards sometimes raid livestock barns during heavy snowfalls when prey becomes scarce, especially as they age and become weak. During such raids, they kill dozens of animals at once. Also, rising temperatures due to climate change are driving common leopards to higher altitudes, further increasing the threat to livestock.Multiple stakeholders have set up mechanisms to protect endangered species like snow leopards by reducing human-wildlife conflicts. But affected livestock farmers complained that these efforts only add to their misery.“I got nothing from anyone—not from the insurance company, the local government, or any of the agencies involved in snow leopard conservation,” complained Santosh Pariyar, another resident from ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality who lost 27 mountain goats in a snow leopard attack. “The insurance company wanted photos of the snow leopard carrying off my goats, along with tags as proof. Local officials asked me to show where the dead goats were buried.”Many livestock farmers the Post spoke to voiced similar frustrations, saying the mechanisms meant to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are overly problematic and too mechanical, which is fuelling growing resentment towards snow leopards.“Who would not be angry when dozens of livestock are killed at once,” said Anil Adhikari, executive director of the Teka Samuha Nepal, a non-profit that runs a community-based snow leopard conservation project in six local units in Mustang.“Unless we make the mechanisms set up for lessening human-wildlife conflict more farmer-friendly and provide compensation on time, we cannot expect the intended results.”Adhikari claimed that retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which used to be a major challenge to conservation efforts, have declined thanks to years of awareness efforts. He also said that farmers' growing frustration with the authorities' lackadaisical approach to compensation is a lingering issue. “Getting compensation from insurance companies and other authorities concerned is too difficult,” said Niraj Thakali, a local from Jomsom, Mustang. “First of all, most herders cannot gather all the required proof—photos of the leopard attack, insurance tags, and so on. Second, the compensation amount is so small that selling the meat of the dead animals is often more profitable than filing an insurance claim. And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” \nNepal has huge waste potential for biomass, a resource that can significantly boost the economy if correctly managed and valorised, according to a new research paper. Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement. It can reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption.” He elaborated on the benefits of producing a densified total mixed ration using crop residue. “In Nepal, where mass transport systems are lacking, and transport costs are high, such densified feed blocks could be a game changer in feed industries.” Further, biogas from waste biomass could reduce the dependency on imported LPG fuel and produce nutrient-rich fertilisers as by-products.“The country lacks location-specific data on the potential and availability of waste biomass, which is important for planning waste-based industries,” said Prajal Pradhan, the co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Pradhan highlighted lack of mass transport infrastructures and networks and the challenges due to the topography and terrain, which create difficulties in transporting raw materials and final products. “Uncertainty in investment and market, insufficient management regulations and policies, and poor intersectoral coordination are added problems. These challenges need to be addressed to promote waste biomass-based industries in Nepal,” said Pradhan. \nA year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama. But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nThe Khemlal-Harikala Lamichhane Samaaj Kalyan Pratisthan announced this year’s Padmashree Sahitya Puraskaar and Padmashree Sadhana Samman is to be conferred to Professor Krishna Gautam’s ‘Adwait’ and Sikkim’s former Chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling respectively on Monday.The Academy’s President Jiba Lamichhane said that Gautam’s ‘Adwait’ states that the essence of humanity is one despite the belief in singularity, duality and pluralism. “Adwait is written in highly refined and understandable language and style highlighting the issue of establishing equality, empathy and solidarity in human society,” he said in a statement released on Monday.According to Lamichhane, out of 187 books submitted to the Academy, 15 were included in the extended list and five were shortlisted.Similarly, Chamling has been honoured with Padma Shree Sadhana Samman for his devotion to the Nepali language, culture and literature for a long time. Chamling had also been the chief minister of Sikkim from December 1994 to May 2019. Professor Dr Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former ambassador to Japan and vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University has been chosen for the Padma Shree Gaurav Award for his continuous contribution to an equitable society. He has been a civil society activist for a long, Lamichhane said.He shared that each award comprises a cash prize of Rs 300,000 and a letter of appreciation. \nFollowing the split of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav on May 5, another fringe party is in the spotlight for similar reasons. According to party insiders, a group of dissidents has intensified activities with a plan to split the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), and to return to the mother party–CPN-UML.The dissidents are reportedly in negotiations with top UML leaders after they were either not selected as candidates or were defeated in the election of office bearers and Politburo members of the Unified Socialist.“Though I am not fully aware of dissident leaders’ recent moves, several leaders are not satisfied with the party, especially after the election of the office bearers,” said Keshav Lal Shrestha, who fought for the position of deputy party chair and got defeated.“Electing the party office bearers was not the mandate of the delegates to the general convention,” Shrestha told the Post.“In the Unified Socialist, there were various groups based on their opinions. To strengthen the newly formed party, we had agreed to choose the leadership in consensus. However, when the top three leaders were selected unanimously, they later decided to hold the election of office bearers, against the convention’s mandate.” During the election, top leaders issued different lists asking party representatives to elect those candidates as office bearers, Shrestha said. “When the party's top leaders themselves are guided by factional motives and cannot unify party members, why would other leaders still want to continue as party members?”Even though Shrestha did not admit that he was considering quitting the Unified Socialist, he didn’t deny that some party leaders were considering the move.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Nepal the chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal senior leader.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, they had announced to pick office bearers in consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers considering the party establishment’s strong hold on the party organisation.During the office bearers’ election on August 27, the Nepal-Bhusal camp contested some vital positions, and the Nepal camp leader won most of them.After being defeated as vice-chair, Ramkumari Jhakri, Ramchandra Jha, Keshav Lal Shrestha, and deputy general secretary candidates Amar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevanram Shrestha, and other leaders are allegedly considering rejoining their mother party, CPN-UML, according to a party insider. Jhakri, who played a vital role in establishing the Unified Socialist in 2021, has for the last couple of months been lobbying for the party’s merger with the CPN-UML.In an interview with the Post just ahead of the election, Jhakri acknowledged that the party should consider unification with the mother party, UML.However, Jhakri on Sunday said that despite some leaders’ grievances towards the party leadership, there are slim chances of the party being split as yet.“The way the party leaders are handling the party’s affairs has caused disenchantment within the organisation,” Jhakri told the Post. However, she denied that the dissident leaders were considering a break-up.“We are in regular touch with some of the dissident leaders of the party, as reported in the media, but they are not in a mood to split the party,” says Somnath Pandey, a party secretary. “The rumour of the party split spread mainly after three of the federal lawmakers of our party were not involved in the party’s election process,” Pandey told the Post. “But see no such possibility.”Prem Ale, Kishan Shrestha, and Dhan Bahadur Budha, three of the party's ten lawmakers, do not currently hold any of the party positions. When Shrestha and Budha were the party's central members, Ale did not renew his membership.Pandey claimed that Jhakri is one of the party leaders who has considered quitting. Jhakri said she had just arrived from Qatar after attending a function as a party leader, meaning that she was yet to get updates.If there are some grievances of leaders, the party will try to solve them, Pandey said.Jha, who is considered as a dissident leader, also denied that he was planning to quit the party. “I have some reservations over how the election of office bearers was conducted,” Jha told the Post. “The party's top leadership circulated lists of the leaders to be elected, which was a wrong practice. But I have my differences with the UML too, so there is no possibility of me rejoining the old party.”Jha said that since Ale, Shrestha, and Budha are directly elected lawmakers, they might have some issues with the party for not selecting them ministers when the party was in power. “Other leaders should have no issues.”Ashesh Ghimire, a Politburo member, dismissed the talk as rumour. “Yes, there certainly is gossip that some of our party leaders are considering rejoining the UML, but this won’t happen as outsiders expect,” Ghimire told the Post. “It has been reported that some of our party leaders also met with UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli but this is unsubstantiated.” However, party insiders also claimed that in his meeting with some Unified Socialist leaders, Prime Minister Oli reportedly said that the government, before Dashain, will introduce an ordinance related to the political parties, making it easier for the dissidents to split the Unified Socialist. Ramsaran Bajgain, press coordinator for Prime Minister Oli, however, rubbished the claim. “The government is not considering issuing any ordinance to split a party at the moment,” Bajgain told the Post. Splitting a party currently has legal ambiguities. The Political Parties Act states that a group of party dissidents can split the organisation and form a new party if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members as well as at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.In August 2021, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued the ordinance and changed the provision, enabling 20 percent of the central committee and 20 percent of lawmakers to form a new party. The law was then tweaked to help then-UML leader Madhav Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their parties. However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, immediately after the two parties split. After that, the government did not replace the ordinance, causing a legal void. Despite the legal ambiguities regarding the party's split, a group of leaders led by Ashok Rai of JSP-Nepal had split the party. With the support of six other lawmakers and 35 central committee members, Rai had split the party.Their party’s legal status is still unclear as their move to split the party has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the case is still sub judice. \nThe verbal war between the country’s two big communist forces—CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—continues to escalate with leaders from both parties targeting each other in different forums.The Maoist Centre got agitated after the UML pulled out its support to the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Maoist chief, in the second week of July.The series of attacks and counter-attacks against each other is unlikely to stop anytime soon, leaders from both sides say.Prime Minister and UML chief KP Sharma Oli has warned the Maoist Centre to stop glamorising the violence it committed during the decade-long insurgency. He urged the Maoist leadership to stop glorifying such violence and asked them to be part of national development.The verbal war between the leaders of Oli’s party and the Maoist Centre intensified after lawmaker and UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai said in Parliament that the decade-long war waged by the Maoists against the state was “unfortunate”. In the House session on August 28, Bhattarai repeatedly termed the Maoist insurgency “violence”.“If the Maoist war was great, why did they abandon it?” Oli said days later. “Why did they join the peace process? If people’s war was great then it should have been successful but it was not. Later the peaceful movement became successful.”In one speech in Parliament, former prime minister Dahal warned that the fate of Nepali leaders could be similar to those of the ruling party leaders in Bangladesh as the recent incidents show and in Sri Lanka two years ago. Dahal went on to say that if the governing alliance of the Nepali Congress and the UML fails to address public aspirations, Nepal could face situations like in the two other South Asian nations.“You, not me, should learn from a lesson from Bangladesh,” Oli said, responding to Dahal, at an event on August 31. “Just yesterday, Prachanda ji [Dahal] reportedly advised me to learn lessons from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But have I killed 17,000 people so I would tremble with fear? Have I robbed the people?”Oli continued, “I do not need to fear anyone. It is Dahal who must learn from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.”Oli also ruled out the possibility of Nepal becoming the next Sri Lanka or Bangladesh as Nepal’s history and tradition are different from those of the South Asian neighbours.At a function organised in Tundikhel on August 26 to mark Gaura Parva, some youths chanted slogans against Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. That caused worries among Nepali leaders and analysts that growing frustration among the Nepali youths could lead to a political disaster in Nepal.The growing rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre has been discussed in both the parties. The two communist forces formed an alliance ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2017. The next year, they merged to become the largest party and governed the country for three years.But the unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre did not last long. A Supreme Court verdict split them in May 2021, ruling that the unified party’s name was illegal.Even after the 2022 elections, Oli and Dahal teamed up twice to run the government but their coalitions were not successful.“After our decision to contest the elections independently, Maoist comrades seem to have become more aggressive towards us,” a senior UML leader said. “Without our or the Nepali Congress’s support, the Maoist Centre is unlikely to retain the national party status after the next elections.” A recent politburo meeting of the UML concluded that the possibility of unity or alliance among leftist parties had been over. On the other hand, the Congress, which joined forces with the Maoist Centre and other parties during the last elections, has also decided to contest the elections single-handedly. “The decisions of the Nepali Congress and the UML to contest the elections on their own have come as big shocks for the Maoist Centre. So they are venting ire against us,” the UML leader said.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has issued a circular to its rank and file to be ready for street protests. The internal communication in the Maoist Centre has further irked the UML, which leads the government.Ram Karki, a Maoist Centre secretary, said the standoff between the UML and his party is likely to continue because there is anger among the Maoists against the UML for having unseated Dahal from power.“There is also a lack of commitment among the leaders on both sides, and a huge trust deficit,” said Karki. “The Maoist leadership has become paranoid after Nepali Congress decided not to forge an alliance for the next election.”He also blamed a lack of political culture and maturity among the communist leaders for the animosity.In his speech to Parliament on August 27, Dahal called the Oli-led government “corrupt and regressive”. Dahal’s fiery rhetoric has created ripples in the UML. Another cause of misunderstanding between the two parties is talk of constitution amendment, which the Congress and the UML agreed to before forming the coalition. Besides, some UML leaders including party general secretary Shankar Pokhrel advocate a two-party system, arguing that it is necessary for the country’s stability and development. Maoist leaders fear the two-party polarisation as that would threaten the existence of smaller parties. \nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nThe government has approved the upcoming visit of Prime Minister KP Oli to New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly.This will be Oli’s first foreign visit after he assumed office on July 15. Prime Minister Oli will lead the Nepali delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. He is scheduled to address the assembly, take part in the Summit of the Future to be organised by UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres and will hold talks with several world leaders on the sidelines of the general assembly.The prime minister will address the UN General Assembly on September 26.“We have sent requests to several world leaders for a meeting with the prime minister on the sidelines of the general assembly,” said a senior foreign ministry official. “We will receive the confirmations gradually.”A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s UN visit, said Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is the government spokesperson. The prime minister will embark on a 11-day-long visit to the United Nations, he said.The prime minister will lead the official delegation of 19 people, including his spouse Radhika Shakya, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana, adviser to Prime Minister Bishnu Rimal, senior government officials, media persons, security personnel, and private doctors, among others.Foreign Minister Rana, who is all set to visit Canada ahead of the UN General Assembly, will join the delegation in New York from Canada.The prime minister and the Nepali delegation will leave for New York on September 20. Oli will participate in the Summit of the Future on September 22 and 23, according to a senior foreign ministry official. “This time, the prime minister will engage in an interaction at Columbia University on September 25 on the topic of ‘Nepal's journey to democracy and economic prosperity’.”Two former prime ministers Sher Bahadur Deuba and Madhav Kumar Nepal had earlier addressed and interacted at Columbia University, considered one of the most prestigious universities in the world. On September 26, the prime minister will address the UN General Assembly and will brief world leaders about recent agreements on Nepal’s peace process and Nepal’s push for climate justice, among other things. \nThe CPN-UML, Nepal’s largest communist party, has apparently forestalled unity among leftist parties. Concluding its two-day politburo meeting on Wednesday, the ruling party has decided against forging electoral alliances with other communist forces.During the meeting of the high-ranking decision-making body, some UML leaders had questioned the potential for unity with leftist parties like the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the upcoming elections. However, KP Sharma Oli, the party chairman and prime minister, dismissed the possibility, saying, “As the Nepali Congress has decided to contest the upcoming elections on its own, it is time for us to do the same and go to the elections independently.”The Nepali Congress and the UML have been archrivals in Nepali politics since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Despite this, they have also formed several governments together in the past, even while competing fiercely during elections and in leading the country.With the rise of new political forces and a strong rival like the Congress, some UML leaders had expressed concern that the party could face a serious threat in the upcoming elections. They suggested forging alliances with other communist parties or forming a “leftist” bloc ahead of the general and provincial elections scheduled for 2027.However, Chairman Oli dismissed the idea, saying, “There is no need to form such alliances, fronts, or unity among leftist parties. We don’t need such unity.”According to Rajendra Gautam, head of the party's publicity department, some leaders were curious about the possibility of a leftist alliance in the upcoming elections. However, Oli, citing the Nepali Congress’ decision to contest the elections solo, reiterated that unity among leftist parties is neither possible nor necessary, according to leaders.In 2017, the UML had forged an alliance with the Maoist Centre and contested the elections under the banner of a broader leftist unity. The alliance yielded strong results, securing a majority of seats, but it fell apart by mid-2021.According to a UML politburo member, there are several reasons behind the party’s decision not to pursue a similar alliance this time. “First, the UML is currently leading the incumbent government with the support of Nepali Congress. Second, there is a good trust between Oli and Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Since the two parties came together to form a government based on a seven-point agreement, it wouldn’t be a wise move to antagonise the Congress by forming alliance with other parties,” the member explained.“Third, the Congress’ decision to contest the elections independently prompted us to do the same. And fourth, the widening rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre in recent days also contributed to the decision to go it alone.”There are also strong voices within the UML that the party should not carry the burden of the Maoists into the upcoming elections, said the politburo member, adding, “We have already learned a lesson from our past decision to unite the party with the Maoists.In the politburo meeting, some leaders argued that the old model of left unity did not work. “So if an alliance with leftist parties is necessary, it should focus on unity with party cadres and supporters, rather than the leadership,” said Bishal Bhattarai, another member of the UML politburo.“We have a very painful history of failed unity among the left parties,” Bhattari added. “Therefore, we now have to opt for the new model where serious discussion and deliberation on ideology, organisation, and other critical issues would be discussed before forging any alliances.”He said the past unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre left a bad impression on the public. “Next time, if we consider leftist unity, we have to be careful, and engage in detailed discussions and deliberation,” said Bhattarai.The meeting also decided to give continuity to the partnership with the Nepali Congress and oppose any efforts at leftist unity. Also, the party has vowed to address growing issues of indiscipline and disorderly activities, so that the party could emerge as a strong national force in the 2027 elections.In his address, Oli had reviewed the current political situation, the government’s performance, and outlined future priorities. He urged the party members to work together to make the party’s Mission 2084 [2027 elections] a grand success. The UML has already launched several campaigns targeting the next elections. A total of 51 politburo members shared their suggestions and feedback during the meeting, where party general secretary Shanker Pokhrel presented a proposal to position the UML as a decisive national force. The meeting also provided several suggestions to improve the government’s functioning. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nAll Ncell customers can now enjoy TikTok.

This means all Sadhain ON pack customers can now use TikTok with free data, alongside other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. “It is indeed a positive step for the industry as well as customers that the ban on the popular social media platform TikTok has been lifted, and we would like to thank the government of Nepal,\" said Umair Mohsin, Chief Commercial Officer of Ncell. “Effective today (Friday), we also introduced the TikTok Pack, which provides access to TikTok at an affordable rate. We have also included TikTok in the social media list of our Sadhain ON packs. We believe this will make accessing TikTok even easier for our valued customers.” \n\nNepali health officials have reported at least six deaths and 36 infections from the deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon season this year.According to the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services, several districts, including Kailali, have reported both deaths and infections from the deadly virus.“Six deaths and 36 cases of infection have been reported so far this year from various districts,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the section. “Last year, there were five deaths and 107 cases of Japanese encephalitis infections.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent the JE infection. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Health Directorate of Sudurpaschim Province, reported that two patients—a nine-year-old boy from ward 5 and a 60-year-old man from ward 6 of Ghodaghodi Municipality of the district—died from the infection.“The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out serological tests, confirmed the virus in both deceased and infected patients,” Dr Khagendra Bam, acting director of the directorate, told the Post over the phone from Doti. “Four others receiving treatment at hospitals are from adjoining Gauriganga Municipality, and their conditions are stable.”Officials say they are currently collecting data on under-five children to administer the vaccine. However, officials at the Health Ministry said that there are no immediate plans for additional vaccination drives in the disease-hit areas.“Deaths and infections from JE are reported every year, as the disease is endemic in our country,” said Gautam. “But the number of deaths and infections has significantly decreased compared to the past.”Officials said that in the past, dozens of people would die, and around 600 would be infected by the JE virus each year. Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths. \nUpon assuming office, Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel vowed to end the long waiting lines at public hospitals within a month of his appointment. He then pledged to raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 soon.But neither have the long waiting lines at the state-run health facilities ended, nor have serious discussions been held yet to increase government health insurance coverage.And now, the Ministry of Health and Population has issued a circular to all agencies concerned to implement the cabinet decision of running outpatient care on public holidays.Multiple experts the Post talked to, including doctors, retired bureaucrats, and representatives of the Nepal Medical Association, said that it is easier said than done and suggested that Health Minister Paudel should consult with experts before making any decision.“Many state-run hospitals have not even been able to run extended services,” said Dr Senendra Upreti, the former health secretary. “Decisions to end waiting lists at state-run hospitals, increase coverage of the health insurance scheme and run patient care on public holidays sound too good, but one should also know about the challenges of implementing those decisions. Long waiting lists at the hospitals should have ended as of now if it was so easy to do.”Most health ministers visit state-run hospitals upon assuming office and direct officials concerned to end the long waiting lists, commit to increasing human resources, and provide a required budget to ease patients’ suffering.Doctors say people have not expected the repetition of the same commitments from the new minister, from whom they have expected some changes.“Why would one serve on public holidays without any incentive, and how could the government force only health workers to serve on public holidays, not other civil servants?” questioned Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a retired chief specialist at the Health Ministry. “I didn’t find other countries providing outpatient care on public holidays.”Upreti, who also served as chairman of the Health Insurance Board, said the minister's commitment to increase the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 shortly shows his ignorance about the ground reality. The government pays a premium of over 50 percent of those enrolled in the scheme and has to allocate additional billions of rupees to reimburse the hospitals. Due to the government’s inability to reimburse hospitals on time, many hospitals threaten to stop providing the scheme every year.Public health experts say the government has not increased human resources in state-run hospitals in the last 30 years. Despite that, the number of patients seeking health care has increased manifold, and the capacity and budget of health facilities have not increased accordingly. They said that all staffers are needed to run health facilities on public holidays, and the government has not allocated an additional budget to run health facilities on public holidays.“I have suggested the new health minister to start from small things,” said Shrestha. “He might have thought that ending long waiting lists in state-run hospitals is trivial, but it is not so trivial. I have also asked him to hold staffers of the Health Ministry until office hours first.”Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Association, the umbrella organisation of medical doctors, has protested against the decision to run outpatient departments on public holidays.Issuing a statement on Tuesday, the association sought the government’s attention to the lack of human resources in the state-run health facilities.“No new post has been created in the last 33 years,” said Dr Anil Bikram Karki, chairman of the association. “Doctors have already been working 72 hours a week despite not being incentivised to work during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care]. We should acknowledge that doctors are human beings. They, too, have families and will be stressed and burnt out if they are forced to work continuously.” \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek offers panoramic views of Himalayan peaks, Janaki Mandir showcases Mughal architecture and houses an idol of Sita, Kuri Village offers snow-capped landscapes and panoramic mountain views, Annapurna Base Camp trek leads to the foothills of Annapurna South, Bardiya National Park is home to Royal Bengal Tigers, Khaptad National Park boasts diverse ecosystems and pristine beauty, and Limi Valley exhibits ancient monasteries and Tibetan-influenced culture.\nAfter an arduous journey, the author returns to their hometown, Phidim, discovering its remarkable transformation over the years, marked by urbanization, a lack of opportunities, and a transition to a transit town for pilgrims.\nNSJF Pulsar Sports Award 2080 announced nominees for Male, Female, Youth, and Coach of the Year categories, scheduling award ceremony for September 13th\nEngland allrounder Moeen Ali retires from international cricket after 68 Tests, 138 ODIs, and 92 T20Is, including World Cup victories in 2019 and 2022.\nChina suffered a record 7-0 loss to Japan in a World Cup qualifier, a humiliation that prompted coach Ivankovic to lament the toughest night of his career.\nKoshi Province preserved their unbeaten start in the ANFA Women’s League as they defeated Bagmati Youth Club 2-1 to register their second victory in as many games at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Thursday.Bishnu Maya Bal had given Bagmati the lead in the 26th minute but Samikshya Magar’s goal three minutes later and an own goal from Divya Yasmali Magar fired Koshi to the summit after the first round.It was the season's first defeat for Bagmati, who had thrashed Sudurpaschim Province 5-1 in the opening round.Koshi, who thumped Waling Municipality 4-0 in the league opener, looked the better side from the start and contained Bagmati in their own half most of the time. But it was Bagmati who took the lead against the run of play after Koshi defenders’s failed attempt to clear a corner allowed Bal to cleverly place the ball into the second bar, leaving Koshi goalkeeper Buli Sarkar helpless.Koshi cut short the mourning period and were level only three minutes later after Bagmati goalie Karun Budhathoki failed to stop a long-ranged effort from Samikshya.Koshi went 2-1 up after 54 minutes with the help of an own Bagmati goal. Bagmati’s Yamsali’s attempt to block a powerful shot from Koshi’s Pratiksha Rai duped goalkeeper Budhathoki before finding the net.Asmita Khawas, who scored a hat-trick against Sudurpaschim on Monday, reached closer to finding the equaliser in the 64th minute when Sanu Maya Waiba brilliantly set her up with a long pass just inside the arc of the area but Khawas’s attempt to put a header over the advancing goalie Sarkar lacked enough firepower.Bagmati pressed for an equaliser in the final minutes but could not find the net. In the day’s other action, Waling Municipality bounced back from their opening loss to beat Karnali Province 4-0 later in the afternoon.Jackline Nassali scored a hat-trick and Sukriya Miya added their fourth to give Waling their first three points.Waling brought three Ugandan players to strengthen their squad and it paid immediate dividends as Nassali gave her side the lead in the 10th minute converting a pass from Miya.Nassali doubled the lead in the 41st minute. Her Ugandan compatriot Viola Nantongo was the provider. Viola’s perfectly placed freekick beat the offside trap and Nassali launched a volley past the advancing Karnali goalkeeper Lila Joshi.Nassali then completed her hat-trick—second of the league—in the 73rd minute from close range after good work from Anjali Machamasi.Miya wrapped up a convincing victory with a tight-angled shot that hit the upright before going in.Karnali have one point, earned from a 1-1 draw against Chandrapur Municipality on Tuesday. \nIsraeli airstrikes killed 16 people in western Syria and wounded dozens more overnight, Syrian state media reported on Monday, the deadliest Israeli attack reported by Syrian authorities since the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus was hit in April.There was no immediate comment from Israel, which typically remains silent on reports of strikes in Syria.The Syrian state news agency SANA, citing a military source, said Israel had launched the strikes at around 11:20 p.m. (2020 GMT on Sunday and targeted “a number of military sites in the central region”, without elaborating on what was struck.Syrian air defences had shot down some of the missiles, the source said. SANA cited a local health official as saying 36 people had been wounded, six of whom were in serious condition.Two regional intelligence sources said a major military research centre for chemical arms production located near Masyaf, in Hama province near the Mediterranean coast, had been hit several times. They said it was believed to house a team of Iranian military experts involved in weapons production.However, a senior regional military source close to Damascus and Tehran denied the accounts that it was a chemical weapons facility, saying that the target was a well-known Syrian research facility.The Syrian foreign ministry condemned the attack as an act of blatant aggression. In addition to the 16 fatalities and 36 wounded, it had caused “material damage to some residential areas”, it said in a statement reported by SANA.Iran's foreign minister spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran strongly condemned the “criminal attack” in Syria.“We do not confirm what was reported by media outlets linked to the Zionist regime (Israel) about an attack on an Iranian centre or a centre under Iran's protection,” he said during a news conference, in response to a question about the attack.Syrian state media also reported that the strikes caused two fires, which firefighters were working to extinguish.Israel has for years been targeting what it has described as Iranian or Iran-backed targets in Syria, where Iranian forces and Tehran-backed militias deployed widely to support President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war.It has stepped up the campaign since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel from Gaza, including the April 1 attack that hit the Iranian embassy compound and killed senior Iranian commanders including one of Tehran's top generals. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nUnauthorized book translations and piracy in Nepal's market are rampant, harming authors, publishers, and readers, despite existing copyright laws that prohibit such practices.\nLawmakers’ brazen but futile attempt to impose a five-year statute of limitations on corruption cases lays bare not only the extent of corruption in Nepal but also how far they will go to absolve the corrupt from wrongdoing. Members of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of parliament are working to finalise the bill to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, which is the prime corruption law of the land. After widespread public objection for weeks over the amendment, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak informed the committee in late August that the KP Oli-led government would no longer proceed with the proposed amendment. But the withdrawal raises more questions than answers. The issue in question involves Section 45 of the Act, which states that public servants can be prosecuted for corruption they committed on the job even after they leave office. Plain and simple! It sets no time limit within which legal proceedings may be initiated. However, the proposed bill does, dividing Section 45 into three different Sub-sections, of which Sub-section 1 requires that a corruption case must be prosecuted within five years of knowledge of such an act. Sub-section 3 says that the five-year limit does not apply to corruption arising out of misuse of government, community and public property. The five-year statute of limitations would have simply enabled corruption to take deeper roots.The bill was first registered in the National Assembly in January 2020. KP Oli was the Prime Minister back then. The Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) allied to contest the 2017 general elections and dominated, winning 121 and 53 seats respectively in the 275-member House of Representatives. The two parties even merged in May 2018, but a Supreme Court ruling rendered the merger defunct in March 2021. The bill was registered in the National Assembly as they had a two-thirds majority, with the UML’s Ganesh Prasad Timilsina as the chairperson. The Upper House passed the bill in March 2023.No statute of limitations on corruptionThe bill is now at the House of Representatives. Again, Oli, the leader of the second-largest party with 79 seats, heads the government. After the UML withdrew support to his predecessor Dahal, whose party is the third-largest with 32 seats, Oli has been in power since mid-July this year. And, as luck would have it, with the backing from four other coalition partners, including the largest party with 88 seats, the Nepali Congress, Oli enjoys a two-thirds majority. Dev Raj Ghimire of the UML leads the House, while Ramchandra Poudel, a Nepali Congress veteran, is the President. Oli probably thought he would be able to ram the bill through. But opposition—among politicians, the media and the public—thankfully, was huge. Consequently, the government was forced to change the course of its half-baked plan to codify a five-year statute of limitations. But the fact that they had the audacity to even propose such an idiotic idea at all is a testament to the deteriorating political mentality in Nepal. Pervasive corruption in the top echelons of the government is no longer news. Be it a case of illegal grabbing of public lands or sending Nepalis as Bhutanese refugees for monetary benefit, the political elites are immersed in corrupt practices up to the gills. Last year, Transparency International’s Corruption Practices Index ranked Nepal 108th out of 180 countries and territories, giving it a slim score of 35 out of 100.A weakened justice system reduces accountability for public officials. If the proposed amendment had become law, this would have only increased impunity for corruption. Now that the Oli administration has clarified that it is no longer pursuing it, lawmakers should focus on a different act. Sub-section 2 of Section 13 of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act, 1991 already limits the time for the CIAA to initiate prosecution to five years of corruption taking place. In essence, if someone commits corruption and manages—using some of the ill-gotten wealth—to suppress the crime for five years, he gets off scot-free. As unreal as this may sound, this is already the law.Blow the whistleIdeally, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act, 1991, should not conflict with each other, but that is precisely what they do regarding the statute of limitations on corruption. Ironically, the CIAA was formed as far back as February 1992—a couple of years after the civil unrest that led to the onset of a multiparty system in April 1990—with a noble goal of corruption control within the government. It is an autonomous constitutional body. Yet, it routinely takes the flak for only going after and successfully prosecuting the small fish, not the big ones. The aforementioned Sub-section 2 of Section 13 of the Act is a loophole and must be plugged. Prem Kumar Rai, former home secretary, is the current chief commissioner of the CIAA. The post is a political appointment, as is, let us say, ambassadorial. This is how it is practised in other countries as well. But the main difference here is that these positions—among others—are filled more on party quota and less on merit. The appointees thus feel obligated to be loyal to the party and/or the leader who appointed them. Oli appointed Rai in February 2021. Then, there is the unfortunate practice of ministers, and even the prime minister, making Cabinet-level decisions that are treated as above the law. This does nothing but help foster policy-level corruption, such as the one regarding Lalita Niwas.Oli, Dahal and Sher Bahadur Deuba, a five-time prime minister and Nepali Congress president, sing their own praises as to how they have actively fought corruption. Yet the public wonders how most politicians who entered Kathmandu wearing slippers are now worth millions. If these leaders are seriously committed to combating corruption, they can show it by strengthening the laws surrounding whistleblowers, who would step forward through a robust legal framework of protections and rewards. The public would earnestly appreciate it. Their level of frustration is so elevated that any political party that dares to take on corruption head-on is likely to get rewarded handsomely in the 2027 general elections.  \nIn the last decade, three political leaders have captured Nepal’s democracy and the state. They control the political parties, and through them, the whole nation. They have complete control over the affairs of the state; no high-level corruption is possible without their consent.Yet, in the last few months, new kinds of political competition, with deeper structural roots, are playing out. But the problems are so entrenched that changes to the status quo look difficult in the near term.The future of Nepalis will depend on how this conflict plays out, whether we will be able to solve our most persistent problems and reap the benefits of democracy.Political competitionThe first type of political competition—among the largest three parties—is the most banal, yet the most threatening. What looks like a game of musical chairs is aimed at shoring up the powers of three individuals and their factions. In the process, they have the potential to rig political systems in their favour so that changes to the status quo become more difficult.In the latest round of the game, Nepali Congress (NC) leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister KP Oli have forged an alliance, “kicking out” Pushpa Kamal Dahal from power. Both parties have shown a temporary commitment to fighting the next election on their own strength without forging a political alliance, and, maybe, avoiding another round of betrayal by Dahal. It is no surprise that Oli blamed Dahal for trying to “incite malcontents and create unrest.”On his part, Dahal is on a nationwide campaign, trying to shore up support. He has alleged the NC and the CPN-UML of trying to push back the country towards a two-party system, initiating regressive changes in the constitution, allowing more space to geopolitical pressures and dissuading anti-corruption initiatives. A Maoist Centre leader, Giriraj Mani Pokharel, claimed that Dahal’s anti-corruption initiative was the primary reason for his ouster.Behind the NC-UML nexus is another perceived threat: The rise of new parties, political figures and political movements. It seems as if the ruling coalition is intent on weakening the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and Mayor Balen Shah, who represent emerging aspirations for a new kind of political culture.As if the threat from “neophytes” was not enough, leaders of the three major parties are facing competition from within their parties.In the UML, as discontent and indiscipline grow, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari appears to be reorganising the party base, offering an alternative to PM Oli’s leadership. In the NC, young leaders like Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma are pushing for a paradigm shift in party organisation and leadership. Even within the MC, Dahal feels the threat from two different factions, forcing him to claim that he remains above the position of party president—given that he has been globally recognised as the leader of a political movement. He said he would one day hand over the party to a special team and play a different role, but that day has not come yet.Competition among and within political parties and political movements is visible. What remains invisible, yet has the potential to transform politics, is the shifting political psychology of the public. The rise of a new generation of citizens, who are dealigned with traditional parties, fed up with corruption, and want broad-based reforms in the economy, is not so simplistic. However, it has the potential to upend traditional politics and pose a direct threat to the interests of existing leaders.Entrenched problemsSince October 2015, only Dahal, Deuba and Oli have become prime ministers, playing seven rounds of musical chairs. Yet, they are the ones to complain the most about political instability. By the end of 2027, it would be 12 years since the promulgation of the constitution, and despite all the “instability,” only three would have shared the premiership eight times. Unfortunately, they will most likely be the ones to continue until 2032. This is a unique kind of political stability, although unwanted.Another undesired challenge is the role of geopolitical engagements in Nepal. On the one hand, geopolitical actors continue to play the traditional role of allies and “trusted friends.” However, a more controversial process is also taking place, that of elite control and resource capture. Despite claims to the contrary, senior party leaders accept that China and India have the leverage and means to influence political careers and party viability. So far, we’ve seen that both China and India have influence over major political parties, meaning that party polarisation towards either China or India has not been feasible. Geopolitics offers local political elites the opportunity to entrench themselves and capture more resources than those coming from outside. Pokhara International Airport is one example. This issue needs closer scrutiny.Political reforms and change in leadership are closely linked to corruption and kleptocracy.It is common knowledge among Nepal’s bureaucracy and experts that, in the last two decades, none of the major corruption cases would have been possible without the consent and willful inaction of the Council of Ministers. It is no secret that electoral politics is becoming extortionate and is driving corruption. So is party politics. Top leaders need an inordinate amount of money to maintain control over the party.In the last two decades, corruption in Nepal has become so systematised that it has led to an elaborate kleptocratic network. The network is patronised by influential political leaders and run by several key individual “brokers.” The kleptocratic network that pervades political parties, the bureaucracy and the judicial system, partners with the state machinery to steal from the ordinary people, consumers and the state. The kleptocracy has developed impunity to protect its members and ensure that resources continue to flow up.The kleptocratic system, most of the time, is undifferentiated with crony capitalism and policy corruption. Crony capitalism is especially prevalent in procurements, natural resources, finance, health and education sectors. Given the robust but hidden linkages between politics and business, this will continue in the near future. As long as crony capitalism remains strong, a fair and competitive market will remain a mirage for the younger generation of professional entrepreneurs and expatriate well wishers.ConclusionSadly, the current political course is unlikely to change soon. A lot of energy and political power is needed to dismantle kleptocracy, enact critical reforms in the electoral and political systems, and transition to a fair, competitive and broad-based market system.As long as political elites control the state and the prospect of political and economic reforms, changes will not be possible without their consent. The only way out is either to wrest off their power or align their interests with potential reforms.In this context, growing discontent among the people and emerging political competition have the potential to widen the space for changemaking.It’s time to recognise that, maybe, we need disruption. We’ve had too much stability, of the unwanted kind. \nFor most of human history, human rights did not exist. The struggle to secure them arguably began in 1215 with the Magna Carta in England, which promised protection from illegal imprisonment as a right. But it took another 733 years and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for those rights to be enshrined for all.Now, just 76 years later, they’re at risk of being lost.Amid an ongoing and very public massacre in Gaza, to which the countries of the West remain mute spectators or enablers, the moral distinction between the liberal democracies of the West and the illiberal democracies and dictatorships among the rest is disappearing.An estimated 40,000 Palestinians, many of them babies, children and women, have been killed in the Israeli massacre in Gaza, which began after a terror attack by Hamas that killed 1,478 Israelis, most of them civilians. The victims of Israel’s attacks include 113 journalists and 224 humanitarian aid workers, of whom 179 were employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. There are also credible accusations of sexual crimes by Israeli forces.The Western and especially the American response to all this, ranging from silent nods to standing ovations for the Israelis, may enable other governments around the world to justify all manner of human rights violations in the name of national security.The rise and fallThe fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of totalitarian regimes across Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union ushered in a new era of freedoms, rights and democracy in those parts of the world.The United Nations organised a series of world conferences in the post-Cold War period, starting with the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, and the 1995 World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. Governments and non-governmental organisations were mobilised for these conferences, and the world saw an unprecedented growth of non-profit organisations, including many that worked in the area of human rights.In some nations ruled by autocrats who sought to suppress non-government organisations, especially human rights organisations, assistance from the West was their lifeline. Western liberal democracies stood as the moral vanguard, often critiquing the crackdown, and their media amplified this.The September 11, 2001 attacks in New York by Al-Qaeda changed that.The US’s PATRIOT Act encouraged other countries to adopt similar anti-terror legislation. The targeting of human rights organisations and activists under anti-terror laws began soon after and became a worldwide phenomenon.By 2012, India had made “dissent” including causing or intending to cause disaffection against India, a terror offence under its anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The law was amended in 2019 to enable individuals to be designated as terrorists without due process. Consequently, in 2024, Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy became one of the accused under this law for an alleged speech about Jammu and Kashmir in 2010.The most significant negative impact on human rights groups worldwide from the September 11 attacks arose from the expansion of the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), initially established in 1989 by the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering. It expanded its mandate to include “terrorism financing” in 2001. The FATF issued several guidelines to ensure no terror financing by non-profit organisations (NPOs). Governments around the world have since used this as a tool to throttle funding to NPOs.In 2010, India was found non-compliant by the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Report on NPOs, clearly stating that “India has not demonstrated that measures are in place to sanction violations of oversight measures or rules by NPOs or persons acting on behalf of NPOs for NPOs other than those registered under the Income Tax Act and under the FCRA”. The report suggested India amend its laws on non-profits.India subsequently amended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA) in 2020 to further restrict the inflow and use of foreign funds. In the last decade, FCRA licences of more than 20,693 NGOs have been cancelled. The most prominent human rights organisation in the world, Amnesty International, faces charges of money laundering in India and was forced to halt operations there in 2020 after its bank accounts were frozen.The FATF evaluation published in June 2024 was cited by the Indian government for repeated extensions of the tenure of the Chief of Enforcement Directorate S.K. Mishra, a favoured bureaucrat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Enforcement Directorate is the strong arm of the government responsible for cases against numerous opposition politicians and the first-ever arrest of an incumbent chief minister, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal.India is not alone. Across the world, the FATF recommendations have been used to effectively close down non-profit organisations.Economics and nationalismThe rise of China and India intensified an already existing debate about development assistance in the West. Then, the 2007-08 financial crisis happened.After that, state and private donors simply did not have adequate funds to share, and development assistance came under stress and scrutiny in the West. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further dried up resources. For human rights organisations in the global south, which were largely sustained by financial assistance from Western countries, the combination of state repression and fund crunch have been fatal.As right-wing nationalism has taken centre stage in country after country, from India to Brazil and Hungary to the US in the last decade, authorities have taken measures to block foreign funding to NGOs to prevent “foreign interference”. The issue for governments is sovereignty and national security. As we are witnessing with Gaza, there are no limits to what can be justified through such arguments.The effective ban on foreign funding and the Soros Foundation in 2018 by Viktor Orbán of Hungary, a recipient of the Soros Foundation’s scholarship to study at Oxford, epitomised the backlash against rights and democracy issues in the West. The European Union stood by as a mute witness as Orbán made Soros the scapegoat of the far right.Governments copy one another in their rhetoric and tools of repression.Russia’s Foreign Agent Law of 2012, which requires anyone who receives support from outside Russia to declare themselves as foreign agents, is being replicated in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia and Hungary, just the way India’s FCRA law was replicated in Bangladesh which established an NGO Affairs Bureau to control foreign funding. However, it is not in Russia but in the West that one can find older laws that arguably set the template.The United States has had a Foreign Agents Registration Act since 1938 that requires public disclosures from “agents of foreign principals engaged in political activities”, although the law is not evenly applied.The United Kingdom is leading the way in setting a template for targeting environmental defenders. In July 2024, five environmental activists were charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for organising direct action protests that caused gridlock on London’s orbital motorway in November 2022. They face long sentences after being found guilty. If history is any guide, this action of the United Kingdom will soon reverberate in its former colonies and the world.Chakma is the Asia Campaign Manager for the IPLP Initiative on Indigenous Peoples and Director, Rights & Risks Analysis Group.-360info \nHe never lets slip a chance to pontificate on religion, culture, nationalism and whatnot. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he advised dubious home remedies such as besar paani (turmeric water) and suggested sneezing would blow out the dreaded virus from the body. He has his own take on gaidas (rhinos) being unique to Nepal, Ayodhya being in Thori, Parsa, and yoga originating in Nepal. Yet, in a National Youth Conclave last month, he for once expressed his ignorance of something: the LGBTQIA+ community. His statement in a video which went viral—“I don’t know much about the issue”—when asked how his government would support the community, comes as a setback for the progressive image the country has cultivated in the process of ensuring the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals. To say “I don’t know” is human, but certainly not for KP Sharma Oli, Nepal’s Prime Minister, and not on such a vital issue.Nepal gained international accolades for registering the first same-sex marriage last year. It has taken a step forward with the concept of “inclusive tourism”, which aims to ensure a safe destination for the LGBTQIA+ community. The country’s constitution and policies for the queer community and minorities are regarded as the most inclusive in South Asia. Despite this, queer people continue to struggle to find their place in a society that values the male-female binary. Queer rights activists admit that even though there has been some legal progress, much remains to be done, for instance in relation to the community’s citizenship rights. Even with progressive laws, identifying someone as an LGBTQIA+ individual isn’t easy because of the inherent bias against them. This is partly because political leaders with people’s mandate don’t heed them or discuss their issues.Such a display of bias and ignorance from the government head signals a broader problem of political disengagement from minority concerns. The low standing of female politicians in the eyes of their better-ranking male counterparts keeps women from participating in vital decision-making. Oli’s chauvinistic mindset displayed in his recent prejudiced remarks against Sumana Shrestha’s leadership and her political legitimacy is also manifest in the shape of his cabinet that has only two women. Nor does Oli’s cabinet have a single Dalit. The inclusion of queer community in Nepali decision-making organs is a still more distant dream.Political rhetoric has real consequences. As a recent Post report highlights, after Oli’s statement, many queer community members have faced bullying from friends and families alike. For real progress to happen, Nepal’s leaders must make more of an effort to understand the issues and concerns of people from all communities and walks of life. As vital is sensitising both leaders and the public, who often applaud such harmful remarks. As Oli himself admitted after the expression of his ignorance of the queer community, every individual, regardless of gender, should get equal rights. These rights should include the right to live your life the way you want to, and for that way of life to be recognised by the state and society you call home. It is also incumbent on our leaders to better familiarise themselves with LGBTQIA+ policies so that they are not out of step with their younger and more progressive electorate and with the rest of the world.  \nThe two biggest parties of the country, which are also in a ruling coalition, have committed to fighting upcoming elections on their own. In fact, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition, has made the same commitment. This is great news. It is about time the real strength of these parties was tested. Yet there is room to doubt their public stand. Nepal’s current electoral system makes it impossible for any one party to get an absolute majority and there is no alternative to forging an alliance to run the country. So the political parties are tempted to strike pre-election alliances. The Nepali parties are not confident of their popularity: The established ones can no longer count on their traditional vote-banks; nor are the newer outfits assured of their own vote-mobilisation skills. Thus whatever political parties big and small say now, they are likely to seek pre-election alliances for the 2027 vote.Perhaps by design, the commitments of the big parties are also not unanimous. The just-concluded Nepali Congress central working committee passed a resolution to “stand on our own in upcoming elections and ensure that our electorate gets to cast their vote for ‘tree’ [the Congress election symbol].” Yet leaders of the establishment faction under Sher Bahadur Deuba insist that the resolution does not rule out pre-poll alliances. They say such ‘strategic issues’ cannot be settled years ahead of elections. On Tuesday, UML chair KP Sharma Oli also clarified that even though his party is currently in an alliance with the Congress, the UML would fight the next elections on its own. Yet many party leaders are not convinced. The current alliance with the Congress, which could continue till election-time, will make it difficult for the UML to mount a strong attack against its main electoral competitor. Their electoral pitch already muddled, what will be the harm in having an electoral alliance, some UML leaders are asking?The bitter 2021 UML-Maoist Centre divorce aside, there is still a sizable constituency in the UML in favour of a broad left alliance (culminating in an eventual left unity). This constituency is sure to clamour for a communist alliance ahead of the next polls. The Maoist Centre, which has already been reduced to a rump of a political force that had emerged in the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, will also be desperate for a pre-poll alliance just to ensure its existence. The problem, again, is this lopsided calculation of political parties, which reduces electoral contests to a pure numbers game. Ideology and vision are at the heart of competitive politics and without them no political party can stay relevant for long. Pre-poll alliances confuse the electorate about individual parties’ guiding principles and beliefs. Just because pre-poll alliances are convenient for political parties does not make them right. If Nepali political parties were committed to democratic values and if they had a long-term vision, they would not be afraid to play a constructive role in governance and service delivery from the opposition’s bench. Yet as Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s restlessness in the opposition no sooner than he was ousted as prime minister, shows, for Nepali top leaders, getting to power and staying there is everything. Not for them the ground-up task of building the party organisation and steadily gaining public legitimacy and recognition based on their own ideals and values.     \nThe recent case of the disappearance of Mamta Kafle Bhatt, a registered nurse at the UVA Health Prince William Medical Center in Virginia, United States, has distressed Nepalis all over the globe. She was first reported missing on August 2 when police visited her home in Manassas city, where she lived with her husband, Naresh Bhatt and her year-old daughter. What seemed like an act of disappearance seemingly turned into a convoluted case of murder when the husband, a former Fairfax County police recruit and ex-US Army Reserve, was accused of killing her after the detectives searched their home on August 21. Nepalis who knew Mamta and her well-wishers from the community were in shock. If the accusations are true, this would be another sad and shameful case of the killing of a Nepali woman by her partner after being subjected to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). It forces us to reflect on the hidden problem of violence against women in intimate relationships in Nepal. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), IPV is a common form of violence against women and includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by an intimate partner. The National Demographic Health Survey 2022 revealed that 27 percent of women in Nepal had experienced IPV in their lifetime. Further, the registered cases of domestic violence in Nepal have noticeably increased in the past 28 years.Many Nepali women feel unseen, unheard and powerless in their relationship with men. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of consent among Nepali men. During the Covid-19 pandemic, violence between intimate partners increased worldwide. In Nepal, police reported that cases of violence against women steadily rose despite the country being under prohibitory orders. The ingrained patriarchy manifests in various forms in intimate relationships where women suffer and become scarred for life. Marital rape is also widespread, with loopholes in the implementation of related laws.Internalising the lack of safety at home, many Nepali women dream of going abroad and settling there. But, sadly, patriarchy leading to IPV goes beyond borders. This year alone, there have been cases of Nepali women being killed abroad. On August 29, Muna Pandey, a Nepali student, was shot dead in her apartment in Houston, Texas. Police arrested 51-year-old Bobby Singh, who was known to frequent the restaurant where Pandey worked. Earlier this year, Chandra Maya Poudel-Rimal was murdered by her husband, James Rimal, in Ohio during an argument. In the same state, in July, Tika Dhimal was murdered by her husband, Sada Dhimal, who later committed suicide.These instances suggest Nepali women are vulnerable to IPV everywhere. In many cases, women give their partners several chances before speaking up. Even if they decide to seek legal help, they usually settle the matter, facing pressure from family or their partners. A former colleague reportedly knew of Mamta’s domestic violence situation with her husband. When her colleague told Mamta to leave her house and offered help, Mamta decided to give her husband another chance. Although Nepal has made progress through stronger laws against the violation of women’s rights and participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, they are still not enough to ensure women’s safety from IPV. There is an urgent need to foster awareness to empower women to seek help and assert their rights. Finally, we must teach our men the basics of consent in relationships. Legal mechanisms can only do so much if we as a society fail to challenge and change our patriarchal mindset. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe Federal Parliament last month passed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to remain partly to generally cloudy throughout Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast in parts of Koshi, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with some areas in Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces likely to experience similar conditions.Heavy rainfall is also possible in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.For tonight, the cloudy conditions are expected to continue.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nOver three months after its pledge to return the up to Rs500,000 to small depositors in troubled cooperatives, the government has yet to act on its promise, citing the need to finalise guidelines to implement the decision.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024/25 on May 28, the government announced a plan to refund the savings of these small depositors. “To solve the problem in the savings and credit cooperatives, arrangements will be made to return depositers’ money up to Rs500,000 by using the property of cooperatives operators or of their immediate kin as collateral,” the then finance minister Barsha Man Pun had announced while reading out the budget in Parliament.During the budget presentation for the fiscal year 2024/25 in the federal parliament, Pun also outlined plans to address the problems faced by cooperative institutions.The Post talked to the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives and Poverty Alleviation officials shortly after the budget presentation for clarification on how the refund plan would go ahead.At the time, ministry officials had said the government policy, already endorsed by Parliament, would take effect from the start of the new fiscal year. However, two months into the new fiscal year, the government is still busy drafting guidelines to facilitate the refunds.“We are still discussing the details of the guidelines,” Ganesh Prasad Bhatta, spokesperson for the ministry, told the Post. “We are discussing whether to use cooperatives operators’ property as collateral or explore other alternative solutions.”Pun, who as then finance minister unveiled the budget for the current fiscal year, had also committed to setting up a regulatory framework consistent with principles and policies governing cooperatives.He had also emphasised the need for a regulatory body to oversee savings and credit cooperatives and to facilitate their mergers.While the government is still finalising the refund guidelines for small depositors, an eight-point agreement was reached between the government and cooperatives victims on Monday.Cooperative victims had earlier resumed protests on June 24, accusing the government of failing to earnestly implement agreements signed with two ministers in the past.The victims staged the first phase of their agitation in June last year and reached a seven-point agreement with then minister for Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation Ranjita Shrestha.When this agreement was not implemented, they launched the second phase of protest. On March 22 this year, they signed an eight-point agreement with another minister, Balram Adhikari, who headed the cooperative ministry at the time.Following Monday’s new eight-point agreement where the government has again promised to return the savings, the cooperatives victims suspended their 108-day protest.The eight points were agreed upon during a discussion between representatives from the National Campaign for Protection of Cooperatives Depositors and government officials in the presence of Arjun Prasad Pokharel, the secretary of the Ministry of Land Management, Cooperatives, and Poverty Alleviation.According to the agreement, a committee has been formed with the Sub-Registrar of the Co-operative Department as coordinator. It has a mandate to continuously assist in collection and analysis of data to address issues, including the return of depositors’ savings. The committee comprises representatives from the ministry and the national campaign. The campaign chair, Kushluv KC, says Pal Singh KC, a victim of Kuleshwar-based Gautam Shree Cooperative, will represent them on the committee. “The committee will monitor the inspection of crisis-ridden cooperatives and collect all the details, and categorise cooperatives,” Kushluv KC told the Post. “After analysing the collected data, the committee will present its findings and recommendations to the department.”The committee will conduct a financial analysis of the inspected cooperatives, categorise them into well-functioning, crisis-oriented, and those in serious trouble, and recommend necessary actions. A review meeting will be held at the Ministry of Land Management on the last Sunday of every month to review the committee’s progress.Similarly, the agreement reaffirms the government commitment to implement the previous agreements made with cooperative victims. Bhatta, the ministry spokesperson, claimed this time things would be different. “The difference is that this time cooperative victims themselves will also be involved in the process, so the agreement will be implemented,” Bhatta said.Likewise, Kushluv KC, chair of the agitating National Campaign for Protection of Cooperatives Depositors, also is optimistic.“This time, the government has promised to start the committee’s work within two days of the agreement,” KC told the Post. “We have also agreed to include police officers in the committee work in order to enhance our study.”“We are also eagerly looking forward to the report of the parliamentary special probe committee constituted to investigate the cooperatives scam,” he added. The parliamentary special probe committee formed under coordination of CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa completed its three-month tenure on September 7 and has been given a 15-day extension. \nThe parties in the ruling coalition have agreed to hold extensive discussions with regard to making amendments in the constitution in line with the seven-point agreement reached between the Nepali Congress and CPN-UML on July 1.The Congress-UML agreement outlined that amendments would only proceed after consulting key political parties and stakeholders.At a meeting held at the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar on Monday evening, leaders from the ruling alliance, including those who supported the coalition without joining the Cabinet, emphasised the need for accommodating all the sides in the constitution amendment process. Ranjita Shrestha, chairperson of Nagarik Unmukti Party, said that the parties in the ruling alliance agreed to take any definite move only after consulting all the political forces. “There was consensus to hold comprehensive discussions with all parties regarding the amendments. The meeting focused on reaching a conclusion only after understanding viewpoints from all the sides,” she said. \"Many groups were dissatisfied when the constitution was enacted, and there’s an emphasis on addressing these concerns to improve it.\"The leaders also discussed the ways to improve the government functioning amidst growing criticism from opposition parties, particularly the CPN (Maoist Centre) and the Rastriya Swatantra Party. “There was a focus on how to improve government delivery and how the ruling coalition can move forward with a unified stance,” Mahesh Kumar Bartaula, chief whip of ruling UML, said. He added that the government’s common minimum programme would be based on the seven-point agreement made at the time of government formation.Bartaula shared that there will be weekly meetings among the ruling parties to ensure smooth coordination and progress in the governance and coalition.Earlier on Sunday, the ruling parties formed a four-member taskforce to draft the common minimum programme of the coalition government.Leaders from the two parties including Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba at a meeting at the prime minister’s official residence in Baluwatar to form the taskforce to outline the policies and programmes to guide the government functioning.Party general secretary Gagan Thapa and spokesperson Prakash Sharan Mahat from Nepali Congress; and deputy general secretaries Pradeep Gyawali and Bishnu Rimal from the UML are in the taskforce. \nAs festival season nears, onion prices have risen over the past month and could climb even further, according to market analysts. The price of the major kitchen staple has increased due to the rise in India, Nepal’s key source market.According to Indian media reports, onion prices have risen to over IRs70 per kg in retail in Delhi and IRs80 per kg in other regions.With retail onion prices now hovering over 47 percent higher than a year ago, India’s Union Food Minister Pralhad Joshi flagged off vans of two government cooperatives—the National Cooperative Consumer’s Federation (NCCF) and the National Agricultural Cooperative Marketing Federation—to sell onions at IRs35 per kg.The Indian central government typically steps in when prices of onions, a politically sensitive commodity, start to climb. Every year, in the latter part of the monsoon, the onion crop gets damaged in key producing areas, leading to scarcity and price rises.The price increase in India has a direct impact on Nepal, which is heavily dependent on onion imports from its southern neighbour.Onions are cultivated three times a year in India—in monsoon, winter and summer.According to the comparative price index of the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the wholesale price of onion has increased by 20.32 percent within a month and by 71.29 percent within a year.On Monday, the wholesale price of onion in the Kalimati market was Rs128 per kg, compared to around Rs70 per kg a year ago.In retail, it costs Rs170 to Rs180 per kg.“The price has increased in India, which automatically affects the price in the Nepali market,” said Mohan Baniya, president of the Potato-Onion Import-Export and Wholesaler Association. “The price will start to cool down once the new harvest starts arriving in the Nepali market,” he said, adding that it would take a month for the new harvest to come in. “Until then, the wholesale price will hover around Rs130 per kg.” Traders say that in retail, onion may reach Rs200 per kg due to customs duties and other taxes.“In India, onions cost around Rs65 per kg, and after adding Rs45 customs duty, it costs Rs110, excluding transportation,” said Baniya.For consumers, price hikes on essential commodities, especially when the festival is around the corner, are a major concern.“Without onion, it is impossible to prepare many dishes,” said Banshi Acharya, a resident of Ravi Bhawan, who was buying vegetables in the Kalimati market on Saturday.“The price of daily essentials increases even with mere rumours. This shows a failure in the government’s ability to control market malpractices.”Onion arrivals in the Kalimati market have declined by 31.77 percent within a month. The market received 24 tonnes of onion on Friday.Onion imports declined by 68.14 percent in the last fiscal year, which ended in mid-July, compared to the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year.According to the Department of Customs, Nepal imported 51,544 tonnes of onions worth Rs2.15 billion in the last fiscal year.The Indian government banned onion exports in December last year and lifted the ban in May. However, India imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne, which caused a price hike in onions.Despite the five-month ban, the supply of onions in the Nepali vegetable market remained stable as onions continued to arrive through informal channels, traders say. “Despite the ban, prices stayed stable due to rampant smuggling.”In the last fiscal year, after the government imposed a 13 percent VAT on vegetables, including onions and potatoes, there were substantial price differences for onions in Nepal and India, which fuelled informal cross-border trade of onions, according to several reports. Nepal Police seized thousands of tonnes of onion smuggled in through the southern border, the reports say.Prices, eventually, started to cool down as smuggling surged.Even though Nepali customs officials regularly inspect the border, onions continued to be smuggled, particularly on motorbikes.According to research titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India,’ prepared by South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food from the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India Nepal in the south, east and west.“India’s share in Nepal’s imports in formal trade is 60 percent, but the shares and volumes of informal trade are likely to be higher,” the research says. \nThe ambassadorial recommendations have become controversial once again. Be it the failure to meet the criteria of inclusiveness or the insensitive and superficial responses made by the proposed envoys, the ambassadorial nomination for 17 countries have landed in troubled waters.Taking an exception to the nomination, the parliamentary hearing special committee on Monday summoned Foreign Minister Arzu Rana and inquired why the government failed to meet the constitutional criteria and make the appointments inclusive.On July 29, the government recommended 17 ambassadors and recalled some. But the recommendations have failed to catch the spirit of inclusiveness and have flouted the mandatory constitutional provision. Meanwhile, the parliament hearing special committee has already completed the hearing of 13 proposed envoys.During the meeting on Monday, several cross-party lawmakers criticised the ambassadorial recommendations.Even ruling party lawmakers have criticised the ambassadorial appointment and complained about it with Foreign Minister Rana.The government has failed to recommend ambassadors from Muslim, Madheshi and Dalit communities, said Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, a Nepali Congress lawmaker. “I request the government to nominate ambassadors from underrepresented communities as per the spirit of constitution while filling the remaining vacancies,” Karki said.Meanwhile, Mahesh Bartaula of CPN-UML said that they have failed to uphold the spirit of the constitution despite leading a strong government of two major parties. “We have also failed to assess and review the performance of the serving ambassadors,” Bartaula said.Bartaula then asked a series of rhetorical questions.“Does the Ministry of Foreign Affairs keep the record of ambassadors about what they commit in the committee and what they actually do?” he said. “Does the foreign ministry have a record of such statements? Why do we recall ambassadors after every change in the government? And what commitment do we make that we will uphold the constitutional provisions?”Likewise, Dol Prasad Aryal of Rastriya Swatantra Party reminded the minister about the constitutional provision on ambassadorial appointment and about complaints registered against the proposed ambassadors. “As soon as the government changes, we recall the ambassadors,” said Aryal. “Such decisions definitely undermine diplomatic conduct. An ambassador should complete his or her full term.”Moreover, Anand Prasad Dhungana of Nepali Congress, Ishowari Gharti of UML, Prakash Adhikari of Janata Samajbai Party, Bhagawati Neupane of UML and other lawmakers criticised the ambassadorial recommendation for failing to uphold the spirit of the constitution.After hearing criticisms from lawmakers, Foreign Minister Rana admitted that the ambassadorial recommendation could not become inclusive but committed that the government will make it more inclusive in the days to come.The government had recommended Naresh Bikram Dhakal (Saudi Arabia), Prof. Dr. Kapilman Shrestha (South Africa), Prof. Dhana Prasad Pandit (Israel), Ram Krishna Bhattarai (Sri Lanka), Sanil Nepal (Spain), and Dr. Shail Rupakheti (Germany) as ambassadors.The recommendation of Kanta Rijal to Australia was later changed and recently the government has recommended the name of Chitra Lekha Yadav to the post. The incumbent foreign secretary Sewa Lamasal has been recommended for EU and Brussels but both nominations have not been sent to the parliamentary hearing special committee.Similarly, Lok Darshan Regmi (USA), Chandra Kumar Ghimire (UK), Dr. Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe (South Korea), Junga Bahadur Chauhan (Russia), Ramesh Chandra Poudel (Qatar), Prof. Dr. Krishna Prasad Oli (China), Dr. Sumnima Tuladhar (Denmark), Dr. Netra Prasad Timilsina (Malaysia), Prakash Mani Pokhrel (Portugal) and Rita Dhital (Pakistan) are among those recommended as ambassadors.“The government’s policy is to take maximum benefit of the ambassador’s experience and expertise,” Rana said. “And we tried our best to make the ambassadorial nomination inclusive as per the spirit of the constitution… Those clusters which have failed to get a chance this time will be accommodated next time.”While responding to the queries of lawmakers, Rana said the government has been conducting its foreign relations and diplomacy in favour of national interest.“The government is committed to advancing Nepal’s national interest through ambassadors and diplomatic missions,” Rana said.Rana added that the Cabinet has recently decided to ensure women participation in every government delegation that has more than one delegate. \nVictims of the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative waved black flags at Rastriya Swatantra Party chair Rabi Lamichhane, who is also former home minister, in Pokhara of Kaski district on Tuesday. Lamichhane came to Pokhara to attend the party’s provincial meeting at the Galaxy Banquet in Birauta, Pokhara.The protesters displayed placards with slogans against Lamichhane outside the event venue, accusing politicians of protecting key suspects of the cooperative frauds.On October 5 last year, police filed a fraud case at Kaski District Court against Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, chairman of the Gorkha Media Network, along with 18 other former and current directors and employees of the cooperative, accusing them of being involved in embezzling over Rs1.1 billion from Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Co-operative.During the initial investigation, the roles of former home minister Lamichhane and Dipesh Pun, son of former Vice President Nanda Bahadur Pun, were reportedly viewed as suspicious. To further the inquiry, Kiran Bajracharya, then Chief of the Central Investigation Bureau of the Nepal Police, deployed a team led by inspectors to assist substantively with the case.A diffusion notice against GB Rai was issued on January 23 as he remains at large.Thousands of cooperative victims have been protesting in various parts of the country for months as scores of cooperatives failed to return the depositors’ money. As the cooperative scam emerges as a national crisis, a special parliamentary enquiry committee has been investigating the matter for over a period of three months.Former ministers and lawmakers including RSP chair Lamichhane and chiefs of several cooperatives are under investigation. \nThe International Finance Corporation (IFC) has committed to expanding its investment in Nepal. The Corporation invested 100 million dollars in Nepal last year.In a meeting held at the Ministry of Finance with Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Prasad Paudel, IFC’s South Asia Regional Director, Imad N. Fakhoury, informed officials about the expansion of the investment in Nepal, according to a press note issued by the Ministry.According to the Ministry, Fakhoury stated that IFC’s support is aimed at enhancing competitiveness in the small and medium enterprise (SME) sector and the finance market, while also improving financial inclusion, creating jobs, and supporting Nepal’s climate goals.“IFC’s primary focus is on the Greenhouse, creating more employment opportunities and economic involvement in Nepal,” he said during the meeting.Finance Minister Paudel urged the IFC team to further expand their investment, noting that Nepal's economy requires greater investment for its improvement. \nEvery day, 20 people took their own lives in the last fiscal year in Nepal.It is like a minibus carrying 20 passengers plunging into a swollen river every day, and all of them dying.The country, which was ranked 7th globally for suicide rates by the World Health Organization in 2014, has recently seen an alarming rise in deaths by self-harm.What concerns experts more is that farmers, students, housewives, and unemployed youths are taking their own lives at an alarming rate.According to data provided by Nepal Police, 7,223 people ended their lives in the fiscal year 2023-024. In the two previous fiscal years (2021-022 and 2022-023) altogether 13,823 people killed themselves. Of these, over 40 percent were farmers (5,556), followed by 15.4 percent of students (2128), and 11.6 percent housewives.Although the records show that over 40 percent of those who took their lives were from farming backgrounds, the specific reasons behind these extreme actions remain unclear, say police officials. “Whatever the causes might be, the suicide rates among farmers, students, housewives, and unemployed youths are very high compared to other groups,” said Dr Ashish Dutta, a senior superintendent of police. “A detailed study is needed to find the actual causes behind these suicides.”The National Sample Census of Agriculture 2021-22, carried out by the National Statistics Office, shows that around 62 percent of the county's total population is engaged in agriculture, contributing about a quarter of the nation’s GDP and employing two-thirds of the population. Experts say that since farmers make up such a large portion of Nepal’s population, it is obvious that a significant number of suicides would come from this sector.Mental health experts point to factors such as the burden of debt, crop failure, and rising production costs, including labour costs, among others, as potential reasons for the rise in farmer suicides.Likewise, academic failure, unfulfilled ambitions, love failures, and adjustment problems in new environments, among others, could be the reasons for the rise in suicide rates among students. Similarly, family disputes, domestic violence, and several other factors are linked to to the high suicide rate among housewives.Experts agree that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason but rather due to a complex mix of factors, including the rising cost of living and the struggle to meet basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare, and job security.“Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting not only the individual but also families, friends, colleagues, communities, and society at large,” said Dr Sangeeta Kaushal Mishra, director general at the Department of Health Services. “The issue is not just the number of suicides but also the number of those who attempted to end their lives.”Nepal is among the countries with the highest suicide rates.Reducing one-third of premature mortality from non-communicable diseases through prevention, treatment, and the promotion of mental health and well-being is among the UN-backed Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) targets to which Nepal is committed.Experts say the suicide rate is a key indicator of premature mortality within the SDGs, which are a follow-up to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).“At the time when the government committed to the SDGs in 2015, around 16 people took their own lives every 24 hours,” said Basudev Karki, a consultant psychiatrist. “Now the number has risen to 20. Our government had committed to reducing the suicide rate to 9.7 per 100,000 people by 2022, but this number rose to 24, and last year it increased further to 25.”The government aims to reduce the suicide rate to 4.7 per 100,000 population by 2030 to meet the SDG targets, but as the deadline nears, more people are killing themselves every day. A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council before the start of the Covid pandemic shows that more than 10 percent of the adult population had mental issues in their lifetime and 4.3 percent were undergoing some sort of mental crisis.The prevalence of suicidality, including current suicidal thoughts, past suicide attempts, and a future likelihood of suicidal thoughts, was found to be prevalent in the 7.2 percent population.“Even those individuals who appear healthy on the outside could also be struggling with serious mental health problems,” said Karki. “People generally do not like to talk about mental health issues due to the social stigma attached and lack of awareness. To tackle the growing mental health problems, authorities concerned have to take multiple approaches.”The World Health Organisation says one in four people in the world are affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide.If you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the following helplines.Nepal Mental Hospital suicide hotline: 1166Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital suicide prevention hotline: 9840021600:Patan Hospital crisis helpline for suicide prevention: 9813476123The Transcultural Psychosocial Organisation: 16600102005 \nThe department of transport management has decided to include a photo and QR code on the receipt issued to those who pass the driving test conducted at the provincial level.Following the department's decision to issue smart cards only in emergency cases, Uddhavraj Rijal, chief of the department, said that the new system would be implemented soon. He shared that meeting with representatives from the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, the province governments decided to use the photo and QR code on the receipts provided to the people who passed trial.The printing of smart cards has been halted as the state is unable to manage their distribution permanently. The use of QR-coded receipts will also simplify checks for traffic police. Software issues have caused a halt in smart license printing since the last week of Shrawan.Rijal said that the smart cards would still be issued to individuals with visas who are guaranteed to travel abroad. “The traffic police are working to integrate the use of the Nagarik App as well. If implemented, the new system will first take effect in Kathmandu, Bhaktapur, and Lalitpur,” an official at the department said under anonymity.Currently, 5,000 to 6,000 candidates pass driving tests through 43 centres across the seven provinces each week, with more than 1.7 million citizens waiting for their smart licenses.The department also plans to require candidates to pay for the QR-coded receipt with their photo before the driving test. This measure aims to curb the growing problem of fraudulent candidates taking tests on behalf of others. “It will also prevent people from using someone else’s receipt and driving illegally,” said Rijal. \nThe recent Supreme Court ruling, which mandates an additional 20-metre buffer zone besides the Kathmandu Valley’s major rivers like Bagmati, Bishnumati and Manohara, has of late become a piping hot topic of discussion. While intended to facilitate river management and protect the environment, the ruling ignores the other side of the picture: Its socio-economic repercussions for thousands of landowners and households who will be affected by the verdict. To add to their woes, Kathmandu’s Mayor Balendra Shah has rolled up his sleeves to implement the mandate without consulting even his fellow Kathmandu Metropolitan City office bearers, let alone other stakeholders. He appears hell-bent on implementing the verdict.Shah’s form is in keeping with his reputation of bullheadedness once he decides on a course of action. The recent ruling only appears to bolster his desire to remove riverside settlers and slum areas under the guise of cleaning up Kathmandu. Although Shah uncharacteristically softened his stance through his Facebook post on Sunday, insisting that no homes would be demolished in the process, it happened only after widespread criticism. But then the whole post is rather long-winded, intended more at criticising the federal government and his many critics there rather than reassuring the public of his commitment to protecting their land and property. The consequences of this verdict cannot be overlooked. Rivers and springs run through much of the valley’s prime lands, where many have poured their hard-earned money. They have legally purchased land and built their homes. With the Supreme Court decision, these homeowners fear their property ownership may no longer be valid. Moreover, the government has a poor track record of compensating displaced people. The issue of 188-ropani land between Gokarna and Guhyeshwari Ghats highlighted is a telling example, as landowners there have yet to be compensated for the loss of their land due to the Bagmati River changing its course. The Supreme Court’s decision to mandate the additional buffer zone also raises questions about the judiciary’s decision-making. Why does the apex court have to rule by going well beyond what the petitioner has asked, be it in relation to the tenure of police officers or the size of the buffer lands besides major rivers? In this particular case, Shah has wielded the court decision like a wrecking ball. The court must be more circumspect in cases where judicial meddling can, instead of helping, further complicate things and disturb social harmony. (It must also be rather embarrassing for the justices as they are now expected to ‘vacate’ the dubious ruling.) Coming back to Shah, as Kathmandu’s mayor, he has some major achievements under his belt. Kathmandu is perhaps cleaner now than at any other time in our living memory. The roads are well-lit. Successive measures had failed to pick even these low-hanging fruits. Kudos to Shah. Where he gets it wrong, again, is in his lack of consultations on even vital matters. This does not mean he should start listening to everyone and veer off his priorities. But as the city’s mayor, he should be mindful that the steps he is taking are in the interest of the people who call Kathmandu home. Something Shah has repeatedly ignored is the fact that the capital city Kathmandu is home not just to its long-time residents but also millions of temporary residents from all over the country. It’s a clear choice between short-term popularity and long-term staying power as a leader.  \nEven in the era of the meteoric rise of ultra-right politics globally, Nepal is among a few countries whose politics is dominated by socialists of different shades. From democratic socialists to moderate Leftists to Marxists and Bolsheviks to Bolivarans, all dream of establishing a classless society under a single-party dictatorship. Not being a socialist in this country is a political sacrilege and, ostensibly, becoming anti-development, if not outrightly anti-national. Nevertheless, almost all of these pipe dreamers have accepted the “mainstream” adult franchise-based parliamentary democracy.Not being socialist also (perhaps) goes against the Constitution. This is because, in at least three instances, The Constitution of Nepal 2015 categorically mentions the term “socialism” while defining the nature of the Nepali state. The preamble states that the constitution was issued as its formulator, the Constituent Assembly, was “committed to socialism”. Article 4(1) defines the State of Nepal as “an independent, indivisible, sovereign, secular, inclusive, democratic, socialism-oriented, federal democratic republican state”. Under the Directive Principles (Article 50, Clause 3), the objective of the State is “to develop a socialism-oriented independent and prosperous economy.” Tragically, the constitution has skipped the definition of the term “socialism”, making it a paradise for the interpretation of convenience.Political stunts often resurface to save socialism from falling from grace. When Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the chairman of the CPN (Maoist Centre), was prime minister, he formed a socialist front last January, including three other left parties—Janata Samajbadi Party, CPN (Unified Socialist) and CPN (Biplov). Now out of power, Dahal is trying to bring other fringe parties into the fold for a more organised opposition to the current government. There have been several efforts in history to unite the so-called socialists. But in practice, opportunism has homogenised Nepal’s every political outfit into a power-hungry brute force without principle, let alone ideology. The travesty, however, is that the fundamental allegation to demean one party by the other, mainly among the communist parties, is “the blatant abandonment of the principles of socialism.”Outdated narrativesSocialism takes refuge in utterly outdated socioeconomics and ecopolitical narratives for its survival. The overarching prescription is that the state must not only provide free health and education but also reduce the private sector’s role in the economy. The constitution includes free education up to the secondary level, free basic health care and gainful employment as fundamental rights. The socialists see all economic and political ills as the outcome of engulfing trends of liberalisation and globalisation. They still advocate for land reform that ensures entitlement of the “land to the tiller”. However, in reality, the younger generation is unwilling to own farms as they are moving away from agriculture to modern sectors of employment and entrepreneurship. Huge amounts of fertile land are increasingly being left uncultivated for want of people opting for farming. Besides, the unplanned drive of land fragmentation has converted entire farmlands into unfeasible patches for commercial-scale production of agricultural products. Failed land use planning and haphazard urbanisation have further eroded the prospects of the land used for agriculture.The pro-socialist crusade may not have appeared vocal to stop the privatisation of highly loss-making state-owned enterprises, stall private sector economic reforms and discontinue the centralised planning process, but they have crept into every aspect of economic policy-making. As a result, the economy is persistently left without a development model, and growth has stagnated beyond endurance. Nepal’s market integration with even the regional market is very limited, and the economy, seemingly irreversibly, becomes import-dependent, draining out capital and young brains.RamificationsThe discourse itself is anachronistic. The political parties are not competing to be forward-looking and pro-reform but to prove themselves purer socialists than others. This is rapidly disconnecting the political parties from the political system the country has adopted at a great opportunity cost and from the economic system that must generate output to increase public well-being.Philosophically, socialism with intended control of the state is the opposite pole to federalism, which seeks to devolve political and economic power closer to the masses. But most of Nepal’s political parties are playing devout socialists and ardent federalists. So, it is no surprise that federalism has been able to produce only suboptimal results during the last seven years of its implementation. The subnational political and administrative units created akin to the federal setup for all practical purposes remain subservient to the power concentrated at the centre. The concept of the controlling “central” government is finding it hard to convert into a coordinating “federal” government.The socialist idea of every facility being financed by the state certainly looks benign on the surface. This simply means the state treasury has to be adequately filled and continuously replenished to fulfil all existing public demands for services and facilities and be enough to meet future aspirations for improved quality of life. Without a reliable revenue source, the state can neither finance better public delivery nor develop infrastructure for the future. Nepal is now exactly in this trap.The real paradox of the socialist model of state-managed economy lies exactly here. Revenue on a convincing scale can only be generated if private sector investment substantially increases productivity, profit, employment and personal income. The state financing everything, even if it becomes a basic right included in the constitution, is impossible without making the market economy sizable, vibrant and capable of paying taxes. Such a market is impossible to imagine without unhindered private sector investment. Foreign investment is the new paradigm in the economies with comparative advantage. However, the very idea of a state-controlled socialist economy is perhaps enough to turn the heads of foreign investors away from the economy in question.Even Karl Marx’s Das Kapital advocated for the highest level of capital growth for extreme exploitation to explode into revolution. However, Nepali socialists didn't even recognise the importance of the inevitable expansion of capital for a state. The state apparatus has evolved since Marx to prevent extreme exploitation. Also, capitalists need not be exterminated by violence but can be constructively made liable to duly paying tax to the state.   \nDuring the 2020-21 Covid-19 pandemic, the Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE) reached unprecedented highs despite the broader economic challenges. A speculative mania ensued in the market, driving the stock price of assets to all-time highs. The aftermath of the pandemic, compounded by weak domestic demand, the introduction of a margin lending cap and the Nepal Rastra Bank's benchmark interest rate hikes, made 2022 one of the most challenging years for the stock market. By mid-2022, investor sentiment hit rock bottom, weighed down by a persistently bleak economic outlook, leaving inexperienced investors with significant losses.After two years of dismal performance, the pendulum has swung back as investors rallied around a more optimistic narrative: An accommodative monetary policy, perception of stable political alliance, availability of credit, and appointment of a market-friendly finance minister could stimulate growth, fueling economic recovery and market gains. NEPSE has experienced a remarkable 45 percent surge in less than two months since the CPN-UML and the Nepali Congress agreed to form the government in July.Particularly noteworthy is the revival of familiar narratives and asset price speculation in the market, indicating renewed confidence among the market participants. A consistent pattern observed in every bull market cycle is that optimism overtakes rational judgment, and several shifts occur in the market, such as asset price increase, greed surpassing fear, the fear of missing out overriding the fear of losing money, and risk aversion and caution dissipation. With the sharp rise in asset prices since July, investors are again engaging in opportunistic buying with the anticipation of selling at an elevated price, speculating on the stock prices of various companies, and engaging in risky bets to harness profit and recover from the prior cycle losses.This sentiment resonates profoundly with the cyclical nature of financial markets, where we witness recurring cycles that share striking similarities. As Mark Twain famously remarked, “History doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.” These narratives follow well-known patterns that aren’t identical, particularly those related to human behaviour. The market rhymesThe recent bullish sentiment in Nepal's financial market reflects the familiar patterns from the prior bull market cycles. Analysing market participants’ behaviour dominated by emotional biases provides an understanding of these market patterns. As co-founder of Oaktree Capital and investor Howard Marks indicated in his memo \"Bull Market Rhymes,\" the stock market is heavily influenced by investor sentiments, leading to cycles of excessive optimism and pessimism. When optimistic narratives dominate, prices often spike far above the intrinsic value of assets, only to plummet when reality fails to meet expectations. This pattern persists, with prices oscillating between overvaluation and undervaluation, when market behaviour is primarily driven by emotional decision-making. Financial euphoria is often attributable to the remarkably short-lived nature of market participants’ memory, leading to the swift forgetting of past market crashes. In recent weeks, investors haven't truly forgotten about the 2022 market losses; instead, they find themselves balancing the knowledge of prior cycle lessons and prudence against the greed of wealth. The desire to get rich and recover from past losses tips the scale in speculating asset prices and riding the tide. Prudence, caution and risk aversion are often sidelined in this pursuit. As a result, legitimate concerns are overlooked once asset prices gain momentum. First movers gain a distinct advantage in the renewed resurgence in the market and often generate good fortune, owing more to luck than skill. The momentum attracts new investors to join the ride, and the self-reinforcing cycle intensifies, galvanising many more to join the market frenzy. The inflow of new capital from new entrants elevates the market prices even further, discarding investment principles and replacing them with new ones developed to rationalise the frenzy.As historical cycles suggest, these influences inevitably subside, typically when optimism without fundamental support wanes. The past cycle suggests investors experience pressure when the new capital pool dries up. In due course, investors conclude that the rally drivers may not be as valuable as they perceived, and the fear of capital loss ensues, morphing into the terror of falling asset prices. Investors often forget that collective behaviours influence these market patterns and overestimate their ability to make the right decisions in the new cycle. While resisting the temptation of bull market psychology is not easy, holding on to a few principles may help market participants. Principles to followWarren Buffett, the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, emphasises the importance of extraordinary patience for investment success. As Amor Towles quotes in his book, A Gentleman in Moscow, “If patience wasn't so easily tested, then it would hardly be a virtue.” Resisting the temptation to act often exposes investors to the wrath of bubbles. The ability to watch paint dry usually helps investors see through the bubbles and avoid betting vast sums of money on the verge of excessive optimism. The rare voice of reason is barely heard when the fear of missing out galvanises the market frenzy. Preparing to be lonely when most market participants believe the frenzy helps investors avoid the bubble traps. Some opportunities are lost, but it hardly exposes us to financial ruin. Behavioural patterns have parallels in every cycle, and people who learn from historical cycles understand that the rally is not as mysterious as sizable market participants claim it to be. Even prudent investors may not detect the onset of the next bubble and predict turning points; those who learn from history recognise the rhythms of financial markets. These behavioural patterns are hard to identify and difficult to resist. Hopefully, some of these lessons will help us to avoid participating in the next bubble.  \nThis year, from a pool of around 68,000 Nepali civil servants spread over three tiers of the government, not one was eligible for the annual ‘Best Civil Servant’ award. In fact, for the eighth year running, no one has received this coveted honour. Perhaps the criteria are too stringent. To be eligible, a civil servant must have served in a permanent position for at least 15 years. The concerned individual should have achieved 100 percent performance evaluation for the past five years, not faced any departmental action in the past 15 years, and not have unresolved financial discrepancies in the year of evaluation. And yes, they must also have regularly submitted property details. For one person to meet all these criteria is nigh on impossible. It does not help that at times even when the ‘best employee’ has been selected, the person was later found to be undeserving. For instance, the award’s first recipient, Surya Prasad Gautam, was later dragged into controversy for supposedly grading his own wife's Public Service Commission examination papers. This makes the task of the selection panel harder still: they don’t want to get it wrong and later be mocked and trolled. This failure to find an honest and hard-working civil servant coincides with a declining interest in the Nepali civil service in general. In the past, many young college graduates saw civil service as a stable and long-term source of income and employment. The salaries were healthy, often with the prospect of bonus. Generous retirement and pension schemes were added lures. But very few young graduates these days are interested in the civil service that is often far less attractive in terms of pay and perks compared to the private sector. More than that, the allure of foreign education and jobs is just too strong. The Nepali state officials have also done a pathetic job of attracting bright youngsters to civil service. The Federal Civil Service Bill remains stuck in Parliament. As things stand, it is hard to match the incentives on offer with the growing aspirations of today’s youngsters. Likewise, there is a big dearth of provincial and local level employees, with most civil servants reluctant to serve outside of Kathmandu and a handful of urban centres. It is getting harder to find decent civil servants, let alone award-worthy ones. A wholesale reform of the Nepali civil service is thus vital. But that seems a long way off. Although the three tiers of government are now in place, the state machinery is heavily centralised. Corruption and inefficiency hobble nearly all public offices. Nor are today’s young job-hunters looking for lifetime jobs where, moreover, the only way they can climb up the career ladder is by sucking up to their bosses and political leaders rather than through the quality of their work. Unless there is a thorough clean-up of the image of Nepal’s civil service—in terms of better pay and perks, clean and clear criteria for promotion, the autonomy to work free from political pressure, to name a few desired reforms—just giving out gongs won’t serve the purpose either of motivating employees or attracting qualified ones. Meanwhile, it may not be a bad idea to shelve this award unless a system is in place to produce the kind of civil servants worthy of getting it.    \nLeaders from the ruling parties say that during their meeting on Monday, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Indira Rana Magar from her position, citing conduct unbecoming of her office.Deputy Speaker Rana Magar had landed in controversy after it emerged that she had requested visa interview dates from the US Embassy for individuals unrelated to her official role.On February 26 last year, Deputy Speaker Rana Magar wrote a letter to the US Embassy requesting visa interviews for herself and five others. She has been facing pressure to step down after the letter was leaked two months ago.In the letter, Rana Magar requested the embassy to expedite interview dates for six people, including herself. The others named in the letter were Dipendra Gautam, Sushma Lama, Rajesh Lama Tamang, Sujan Magar, and Dhan Prasad Gurung. Magar had written that she wanted the interview dates to be preponed as they were attending the 67th Commission on the Status of Women session, scheduled in New York from March 6 to 17, 2023. “Writing a letter to the embassy to reschedule visa interviews is not something someone in her position should do,” Bhimarjun Acharya, a constitutional expert, told the Post. “But whether the allegation is sufficient to warrant her removal is still up for debate.” After the UML’s main partner in the ruling coalition, the Nepali Congress, became positive on the proposal of Prime Minister Oli, the fringe parties in the coalition decided to align with the decision of the two largest parties, according to a ruling party leader who was present in the meeting. “Prime Minister Oli proposed removing Deputy Speaker Magar, saying that her conduct was incompatible with her position,” Abdul Khan, a Janamat Party lawmaker who was present at the meeting, told the Post. “By Wednesday, the proposal to remove Deputy Speaker Magar will be filed in Parliament.” Khan added that she is likely to be removed from her post by the end of this (Nepali) month (mid-September). But Chief Whip of the Congress and the UML, Shyam Kumar Ghimire and Mahesh Bartaula, respectively, denied that a proposal to remove the Deputy Speaker will be filed in Parliament on Wednesday.During the ruling parties’ meeting on Monday, Prime Minister Oli had discussed various issues related to Parliament and the role of ruling parties’ lawmakers. Among the issues discussed was the Deputy Speaker’s questionable conduct, Bartaula says. “Although the ruling parties only discussed the issues related to the Deputy Speaker, the way Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) lawmaker behaved in Tuesday’s House session has pushed the ruling parties to resolve the matter decisively,” Bartaula, the chief whip of the UML, told the Post. “Opposition parties have used some media to spread false information about the government’s actions. Since the issue has been raised we will resolve it soon.”After months of heated debate, the ruling parties are now considering that Deputy Speaker Magar’s conduct is not compatible with her office, in line with Article 91 of the Constitution of Nepal, and have urged her to step down from her position. Article 91 (6)(c) of the Constitution stipulates that the office of the Speaker or Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives shall become vacant if a resolution is passed by a majority of two-thirds of the total number of the then members of the House of Representatives that his or her conduct is not compatible with the office. The ruling parties command a two-thirds majority in Parliament, which is needed to remove the Deputy Speaker. In the 275-strong assembly, ruling parties need the support of 184 lawmakers to achieve a two-thirds majority. The Congress (88), UML (77 excluding the Speaker), Janata Samajbadi Party (7), Janamat Party (6), Loktantrik Samjbadi Party (4), and Nagarik Unmukti Party (4) together have 186 lawmakers, which is more than enough to secure the two-thirds majority. Although the process planned by the parties to remove the Deputy Speaker resembles impeachment, the constitution does not specifically term it as such.Ekram Giri, the spokesperson of the House, said should the ruling parties file a complaint against the Deputy Speaker, it must be supported by the signatures of one-fourth of the total strength of the House, or 69 of the 275 lawmakers. If Magar is removed, it would be the first time in Nepal's parliamentary history that a sitting Deputy Speaker is ousted with a two-thirds majority, says Damannath Dhungana, a former Speaker of the House. The proposal to remove Magar has again heated up the country’s political landscape. During the House meeting on Tuesday, the main opposition CPN (Maoist Centre), and the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP), on whose quota Magar was elected Deputy Speaker, criticised the ruling parties’ plan as unacceptable. The RSP has been staunchly defending Deputy Speaker Magar. The party has accused the ruling parties of trying to scandalise the issue with the ulterior motive of ousting her.The RSP claims that the Congress and UML want to replace Magar with one of their own lawmakers after losing their majority in the Constitutional Council. In addition to her roles in the legislature, Magar is a member of the council, which elects the chiefs and members of constitutional bodies including the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. The Constitutional Council, headed by the prime minister, includes the Chief Justice, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the chair of the National Assembly, the leader of the main opposition in the House of Representatives, and the Deputy Speaker. Currently, the UML, which leads the coalition government with the Congress and some fringe parties, holds two seats on the Constitutional Council—Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli and House Speaker Devraj Ghimire (who mandatorily stepped down from party positions upon appointment). The CPN (Maoist Centre) is equally represented in the council, with Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the opposition leader, and National Assembly chair Narayan Prasad Dahal as members.RSP leaders say that removing Deputy Speaker Rana Magar would allow the ruling coalition to appoint one of their own lawmakers to secure a majority in the council, even if the Chief Justice stays neutral in constitutional appointments. “It is unacceptable for the political parties to conspire to remove the Deputy Speaker using majority power,” Santosh Pariyar, the chief whip of the RSP, said in Parliament on Tuesday. “The way two of the largest parties intend to move ahead will undermine the principles of democracy.”Former Speaker Dhungana, speaking to the Post, says, “The accusation against the Deputy Speaker will have political and social implications; I hope the ruling parties calculate these correctly before making such a momentous decision.” \nUkraine targeted the Russian capital on Tuesday in its biggest drone attack so far, killing at least one and wrecking dozens of homes in the Moscow region and forcing around 50 flights to be diverted from airports around Moscow.Russia, the world's biggest nuclear power, said it had destroyed at least 20 Ukrainian attack drones as they swarmed over the Moscow region, which has a population of more than 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions.At least one person was killed near Moscow, Russian authorities said. Three of Moscow's four airports were closed for more than six hours and almost 50 flights were diverted.Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters that the drone attack was another reminder of the real nature of Ukraine's political leadership, which he said was made up of Russia's enemies.\"There is no way that night time strikes on residential neighbourhoods can be associated with military action,\" said Peskov.\"The Kyiv regime continues to demonstrate its nature. They are our enemies and we must continue the special military operation to protect ourselves from such actions,\" he said, using the expression Moscow uses to describe its war in Ukraine.Kyiv said Russia, which sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022, had attacked it overnight with 46 drones, of which 38 were destroyed.The drone attacks on Russia damaged at high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, residents told Reuters.A 46-year-old woman was killed and three people were wounded in Ramenskoye, Moscow regional governor Andrei Vorobyov said.Residents said they awoke to blasts and fire.\"I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,\" Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. \"The window got blown out by the shockwave.\"Georgy, a resident who declined to give his surname, said he heard a drone buzzing outside his building in the early hours.\"I drew back the curtain and it hit the building right before my eyes, I saw it all,\" he said. \"I took my family and we ran outside.\"The Ramenskoye district, some 50 km (31 miles) southeast of the Kremlin, has a population of around a quarter of a million people, according to official data.More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia's Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia's defence ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there.As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has taken the war to Russia with a cross-border attack into Russia's western Kursk region that began on Aug. 6 and by carrying out increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory.DRONE WARThe war has largely been a grinding artillery and drone war along the 1,000 km (620 mile) heavily fortified front line in southern and eastern Ukraine involving hundreds of thousands of soldiers.Moscow and Kyiv have both sought to buy and develop new drones, deploy them in innovative ways, and seek new ways to destroy them - from using shotguns to advanced electronic jamming systems.Both sides have turned cheap commercial drones into deadly weapons while ramping up their own production and assembly to attack targets including tanks and energy infrastructure such as refineries and airfields.Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has sought to insulate Moscow from the grinding rigours of the war, has called Ukrainian drone attacks that target civilian infrastructure such as nuclear power plants \"terrorism\" and has vowed a response.Moscow and other big Russian cities have largely been insulated from the war.Russia itself has hit Ukraine with thousands of missiles and drones in the last two-and-a-half years, killing thousands of civilians, wrecking much of the country's energy system and damaging commercial and residential properties across the country.Ukraine says it has a right to strike back deep into Russia. However, Kyiv's Western backers have said they do not want a direct confrontation between Russia and the US-led NATO military alliance.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about Tuesday's attacks. Both sides deny targeting civilians.Tuesday's attack follows drone attacks Ukraine launched in early September chiefly targeting Russia's energy and power facilities.Authorities in the Tula region, which neighbours the Moscow region to its north, said drone wreckage had fallen onto a fuel and energy facility but that the \"technological process\" of the facility was not affected. \nJunior doctors in West Bengal continue strike in protest of murdered trainee doctor despite court deadline, demanding improved hospital security.\nUkraine on Tuesday struck Moscow and western Russia in one of its biggest ever drone attacks, killing at least one woman, wrecking dozens of homes and forcing the closure of major airports in the capital, Russian officials said.Ukraine launched swarms of attack drones over the world’s biggest nuclear power. Russia said it destroyed at least 20 over the Moscow region, which has a population of over 21 million, and 124 more over eight other regions.Three of Moscow’s four airports were closed for air traffic following the attacks, Russia’s aviation authority Rosaviatsia said. A major road leading to the capital was partially closed.The drone attacks damaged at least two high-rise apartment buildings in the Ramenskoye district of the Moscow region, setting flats on fire, Moscow’s governor Andrei Vorobyov said.A 46-year-old woman died and three people were injured in Ramenskoye, Vorobyov said. He added that 43 people were evacuated to temporary accommodation centres.Social media videos showed flames bursting out of windows of a multi-storey residential building, saying that dozens of flats were damaged in the Ramenskoye district.“I looked at the window and saw a ball of fire,” Alexander Li, a resident of the district told Reuters. “The window got blown out by the shockwave.”The Ramenskoye district, some 50 kms (31 miles) southeast from the Kremlin, has a population of around quarter a million of people, according to official data.More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia’s Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia’s defence ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there.As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has been trying to take the war to Russia with a bold attack on Russia’s western Kursk region on Aug. 6 and increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory.Russia says the attacks are akin to “terrorism” as they target civilian infrastructure.More than 70 drones were also downed over Russia’s Bryansk region and tens more over other regions, Russia’s defence ministry said. There was no damage or casualties reported there.As Russia advances in eastern Ukraine, Kyiv has been trying to take the war to Russia with a bold attack on Russia’s western Kursk region on Aug. 6 and increasingly large drone attacks deep into Russian territory.Russia says the attacks are akin to “terrorism” as they target civilian infrastructure.Ukraine says it has a right to strike deep into Russia, which invaded Ukraine in 2022, though Kyiv’s Western backers have repeatedly said they do not want the war to escalate into a direct confrontation between Russia and the U.S.-led NATO military alliance.There was no immediate comment from Ukraine about Tuesday’s attacks. Both sides deny targeting civilians yet civilians have died in attacks from both sides.Ukraine’s domestic drone industry has been growing rapidly and Kyiv has been stepping up drone attacks on Russian energy, military and transport infrastructure. Russia is the world’s second largest oil exporter.Tuesday’s attack follows a deluge of drones Ukraine launched in early September targeting chiefly Russia’s energy and power facilities.Authorities of the Tula region, which neighbours the Moscow region to its north, told Russian state news agency that a drone wreckage fell onto a fuel and energy facility, but that “technological process” of the facility was not affected. \nDespite the ongoing war, schools reopen in Gaza, with some serving as shelters, while civilians evacuate northern Gaza after Israel's warning and polio vaccination begins amid airstrikes that continue to claim lives.\nPartly cloudy skies with rain, thunder, and lightning in various regions of Nepal; heavy rainfall predicted in Koshi and Gandaki Provinces.\nTil Bahadur Pariyar, a resident of Marpha in ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in the mountain district of Mustang, complained that snow leopards killed 60 of his mountain goats over the last three years.A few months ago, he lost three horses to a common leopard, which has been moving into the mountainous region lately due to the warming climate.“Earlier, we only had to guard our livestock against snow leopards, but now common leopards also kill our animals,” complained Pariyar. “Many livestock farmers have already abandoned the profession due to the growing threat from predators—snow leopards and common leopards.”Nepal is among the 12 countries that are home to snow leopards and has committed to protecting the species, its prey, and its habitats. However, rising temperatures caused by global warming have made protecting endangered species, such as snow leopards, a big challenge.The country has witnessed extreme weather events over the past decade and a half. According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DOHM), Nepal's average annual maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius. The study shows most districts have witnessed increasing temperatures each year, with hill and mountain districts witnessing a faster rise compared to the Tarai districts.“Protecting livestock—mountain goats, horses, mules, and yaks—has become increasingly challenging for farmers in Mustang and other mountain districts, which have been hardest hit by the climate crisis,” said Lal Bahadur Gurung, an expert on snow leopards. ‘‘The rising temperatures have increased incidents of human-wildlife conflicts in mountainous regions, and livestock are getting killed by both common and snow leopards.”It is estimated that there are around 400 snow leopards in Nepal out of fewer than 4,000 worldwide. Experts say snow leopards sometimes raid livestock barns during heavy snowfalls when prey becomes scarce, especially as they age and become weak. During such raids, they kill dozens of animals at once. Also, rising temperatures due to climate change are driving common leopards to higher altitudes, further increasing the threat to livestock.Multiple stakeholders have set up mechanisms to protect endangered species like snow leopards by reducing human-wildlife conflicts. But affected livestock farmers complained that these efforts only add to their misery.“I got nothing from anyone—not from the insurance company, the local government, or any of the agencies involved in snow leopard conservation,” complained Santosh Pariyar, another resident from ward 2 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality who lost 27 mountain goats in a snow leopard attack. “The insurance company wanted photos of the snow leopard carrying off my goats, along with tags as proof. Local officials asked me to show where the dead goats were buried.”Many livestock farmers the Post spoke to voiced similar frustrations, saying the mechanisms meant to reduce human-wildlife conflicts are overly problematic and too mechanical, which is fuelling growing resentment towards snow leopards.“Who would not be angry when dozens of livestock are killed at once,” said Anil Adhikari, executive director of the Teka Samuha Nepal, a non-profit that runs a community-based snow leopard conservation project in six local units in Mustang.“Unless we make the mechanisms set up for lessening human-wildlife conflict more farmer-friendly and provide compensation on time, we cannot expect the intended results.”Adhikari claimed that retaliatory killings of snow leopards, which used to be a major challenge to conservation efforts, have declined thanks to years of awareness efforts. He also said that farmers' growing frustration with the authorities' lackadaisical approach to compensation is a lingering issue. “Getting compensation from insurance companies and other authorities concerned is too difficult,” said Niraj Thakali, a local from Jomsom, Mustang. “First of all, most herders cannot gather all the required proof—photos of the leopard attack, insurance tags, and so on. Second, the compensation amount is so small that selling the meat of the dead animals is often more profitable than filing an insurance claim. And even when you file a claim, it takes months to receive the payment.” Thakali, an activist involved in snow leopard conservation, said that he too lost three horses a few months ago, but chose not to file an insurance claim, as he knows it is not easy to complete all bureaucratic procedures.“There is a growing awareness among locals that we shouldn’t kill snow leopards, even if they prey on our livestock,” said Sabi Thakali, a local from Thini village in ward 5 of Gharapjhong Rural Municipality in Mustang. “The authorities need to step up and provide compensation promptly, if they want us to continue protecting these animals.” \nNepal has huge waste potential for biomass, a resource that can significantly boost the economy if correctly managed and valorised, according to a new research paper. Harnessing waste biomass could cut the country’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption, according to the paper entitled ‘Possibilities and challenges for converting waste biomass into fuel, feed, and fertiliser in Nepal’.Most of Nepal’s waste biomass is used conventionally, such as for kitchen fuel and animal feed, without proper valorisation. This is a pressing issue as open dumping and burning, particularly of municipal waste, is a common practice in Nepal, according to the paper, with detrimental effects on the overall ecosystem.“Our study estimates the potential of about 89 million tonnes of waste biomass annually in Nepal, mainly from the agriculture, municipal, livestock, fowl, and human sectors,” said Sagar Kafle, assistant professor at the Institute of Engineering, Tribhuvan University.“We have revealed the potential at the sub-national level in Nepal, highlighting its possibilities and challenges for converting the fuel, feed, and fertilisers,” said Kafle, who is currently pursuing PhD at Auburn University, US.The paper estimates that through the conversion of waste biomass, Nepal can produce about 1.7 to 5.0 million tonnes of pellet or briquette and biochar, 1.7 to 5.1 million tonnes of feed block, 129 to 387 million cubic metres of biogas, and 0.6 to 1.9 million tonnes of fertiliser.“These valuable products can have significant environmental and economic benefits,” the paper said.Waste biomass is generated from different sources, such as forestry residue, agriculture crop residue, municipal organic waste, and livestock waste. Improper management of such residue and waste negatively impacts overall biodiversity, a growing global concern. For example, the poor handling and management of municipal solid waste, mainly generated from the urban sector, pollutes the surroundings and impacts overall biodiversity, including human health. Its management is one of the significant challenges for the relevant authorities, as it needs resources.Municipal solid waste, comprising more than half of organic waste in developing countries, is being dumped and burned openly in Nepal.Similarly, open burning of crop residues, especially paddy straw, is practised in Nepal, resulting in air pollution. This practice is particularly prominent in the Tarai, where combined harvesters scatter straw across the fields, making collection impractical. Farmers often burn the straw as they find it economically unviable to collect and meet the next cropping season. Livestock manures generate methane during decomposition, contributing to global warming. However, anaerobic digestion technology could trap and utilise this gas as energy.Also, improper management of human waste—urine and faeces—pollutes soil and groundwater, affecting human health. Although the country has declared itself free from open defecation, dumping raw sewage and septic tank waste into rivers is common in Nepal. Due to the lack of proper conversion knowledge and technology and the unavailability of status data, the waste biomass is improperly managed or conventionally used in many developing countries. The conventional use of waste biomass is less efficient, hazardous to the environment, and does not generate economic growth. For example, using dry dung cake instead of biogas for cooking fuel is less efficient, degrades indoor air quality, and impacts human health. The lack of data generation, consumption, and availability hinders policymaking and planning for the biomass-based industry.Some houses also have toilets connected to biogas plants. In the fiscal year 2020-21 alone, about 3,975 biogas plants were installed in Nepal. This shows that waste biomass is utilised in modern ways, such as producing biogas. However, the majority is still untapped and is conventionally used or managed poorly.Proper utilisation of such waste biomass needs quantification at the subnational level, which will help develop innovative industries for sustainable development, such as by enhancing the local economy, creating jobs and increasing the share of renewable energy.The study’s findings are significant and show enormous waste potential in the Tarai, especially in Morang district of Koshi Province. Prof Sushil Adhikari, co-author of the study and professor at Auburn University, highlighted the opportunities for producing fuel, feed, and fertilisers from such waste biomass. “The pellets and briquettes produced from waste biomass could effectively replace coal in thermal power industries such as brick and cement. It can reduce the country’s carbon dioxide emissions by up to 52 percent and meet up to 12 percent of current energy consumption.” He elaborated on the benefits of producing a densified total mixed ration using crop residue. “In Nepal, where mass transport systems are lacking, and transport costs are high, such densified feed blocks could be a game changer in feed industries.” Further, biogas from waste biomass could reduce the dependency on imported LPG fuel and produce nutrient-rich fertilisers as by-products.“The country lacks location-specific data on the potential and availability of waste biomass, which is important for planning waste-based industries,” said Prajal Pradhan, the co-author of the study and assistant professor at the University of Groningen, the Netherlands. Pradhan highlighted lack of mass transport infrastructures and networks and the challenges due to the topography and terrain, which create difficulties in transporting raw materials and final products. “Uncertainty in investment and market, insufficient management regulations and policies, and poor intersectoral coordination are added problems. These challenges need to be addressed to promote waste biomass-based industries in Nepal,” said Pradhan. \nA year and a half ago, Bidhya Chapagain and her team of Herne Katha (Seeing Stories) visited the distant Chum Valley in Gorkha District to follow the story of Phunjo Lama. But soon they met Prakash, or Paka, a shadow figure living in oblivion for over three decades in the valley after being lost from Kathmandu. He had only hazy memories of his family and home in Jhapa, and his real name—Kale Tamang. The Herne Katha team soon began tracing his footsteps back to Jhapa. Along the journey, Paka’s memories of his childhood, his family and his home came back alive in bits and pieces. Ultimately, he found his family back—in Jhapa, where his sisters lived, and in Bhojpur, where his parents and brothers had resettled. On the eighth day of its premiere, as “The Lost Years” had reached 8.7 million views on YouTube, Paka had risen as a folk hero and the Herne Katha team garnered accolades and criticisms aplenty. A curious mixture of his destiny and Herne Katha’s storytelling helped him find home. But long after Herne Katha stopped rolling, his story continues to unravel. From a story, he is slowly metamorphosing into a content as he is being pushed towards uncharted territories. The return from social media-fed stardom to reality is rather troublesome and tragic—as we have seen in the case of the young Sachin Pariyar. Known for his quirky humour and mediocre singing, Sachin became an overnight sensation. Soon, his broken family became a feed for content creators; his father, nicknamed Kaloute, became a celebrated villain; and the child was made to beg on the streets of Kathmandu. The estrangementAs Paka metamorphoses into a subject for content creators, he is quickly losing the plot of his story. As YouTubers seek newness in their content, Paka will be encouraged to fabricate his hardships and seek financial support—things he had hardly ever done before. In no time, having repeated the fabrications on camera umpteen times, he will learn to believe them, even become obsessed with them. Questions about the inconsistencies in his plotline will follow, and he will have to supplement fabrications with lies. In no time, Paka will have lost touch with his story. Unless another good samaritan jumps in to save Paka from the viral infection of social media-driven stardom, this is more or less his trajectory in the next few weeks. There are some tell-tale signs of Paka’s downfall already: His parents have already started crying in front of YouTubers; his brother has already started reciting stale chutkilas; local politicians have offered him land to build a home; provincial and federal government representatives have promised to help him; and the common public have begun garlanding him and offering him money. The man who had mastered the art of living in the mountains will soon be tutored in the art of lying in front of the camera. Negotiating the journey from innocence to experience is often more difficult than spending cold winter nights in the company of yaks and sheep. Finding home should never be accompanied by the loss of self, but that is what happens when the story loses its plot. The spectacleThe history of the media is a story of fabrications. Folklores and myths, poetry and prose, or stories and reels, all depend on some bit of fabrication by the media that bear them—oral, visual, or tactile. The heroes we celebrate or the villains we loathe have all come to us through some sort of fabrications by the media ecosystem. From cave paintings' exaggeration of Neanderthal life to ChatGPT's fabrication about the books this author has not written, media of all forms exist in the interstitial space between truth and falsity. No wonder that Bidhya Chapagain and her Herne Katha team were criticised for \"fabricating\" Paka's story of hardship. Rather than wait for over a year to sell his story, we are told, the makers should have yelled about it into the ears of the authorities—meaning the exploitative system—for punitive action. If nothing, they should have at least asked difficult questions to Paka's master who had kept him without pay for over three decades.In the normative sense of action-oriented journalism, the criticisms against Herne Katha are not unfounded. A deeper probing into what led to Paka's misery would certainly have led to greater accountability from his master and the systems that disallow people like him from finding their way home. But not every story that involves a camera, a voiceover and a character is journalism, much less investigative journalism. Though with backgrounds in journalism, the Herne Katha team, in identifying themselves as storytellers, have not, at least now, made any serious claim to being activist-journalists. Rather, their interest seems to be in bearing witness and telling a good story. Everybody loves a good story, no matter whether it is that of selling dreams or shedding tears. Unless they resort to sensationalism and journalistic grandstanding, a bit of melodrama narrating the bittersweet story of a man lost in the mountains for 30 years is no big deal. But Paka's story is quickly becoming a public spectacle, and there is a risk of him losing his very being.   \nMaya, a 36-year-old single mother from Babarmahal, Kathmandu never imagined that a polite rejection on Facebook two months ago would spiral into a living nightmare.Maya (her real name has been changed to protect her identity) became the target of an online stalker after she rejected a man’s advances. What started as a few friendly messages on social media quickly took a dark turn when the man demanded nude photos of her, which she refused to send.Unfazed, he started sending her unsolicited explicit images of himself. He then began tracking her online activity, leaving threatening messages, and eventually, he found her home address. “I would receive messages saying he was watching me, that he knew where my son went to school,” Maya told the Post. Despite blocking him multiple times, the stalker always found a way to reappear, using different accounts to harass her. Fearing for her nine-year-old son’s safety, she finally mustered the courage to file a complaint with the Cyber Bureau of Nepal Police 15 days ago.Since informing the stalker that she had taken legal action, he has not contacted her again, but the experience has left her feeling paranoid and anxious. She now fears leaving her home and hesitates to go online. “I just want to feel safe again, but I’m not sure if that’s possible anymore,” Maya says.Maya’s ordeal speaks volumes about how violence against women is no longer confined to physical spaces but has increasingly infiltrated the digital world in the form of online abuse, from revenge porn and bullying to sexual harassment, trolling, fraud, and blackmail.The severity of this issue becomes even clearer with data from the Cyber Bureau. In just under two months of the fiscal year 2024-25, the bureau has already recorded 882 cases of cybercrimes involving women. Looking back at previous years, the figures paint a troubling picture. In the fiscal year 2022-23, there were 9,013 reported cybercrime cases, with 4,590 filed by women. The period also saw 130 cases involving minor girls. The following year, 2023-24, witnessed a dramatic rise in the number of cases involving women to 8,745 and those involving minors to 382. This represents an increase of approximately 90.52 percent in cyber violence cases reported by women from 2022-23 to 2023-24.As the country entered a new fiscal year, the trend of online violence continues, with the bureau already reporting 35 cases involving minor girls and 882 cases involving adult women. However, these numbers alone do not capture the full extent of women’s and girls’ vulnerability in the digital space. Traditional beliefs, discrimination, and the normalisation of such behaviour, along with the fear that exposing abuse will shame them and their families, often lead to many cases going unreported.Rita, a 27-year-old woman, from Sunsari whom the Post is identifying with a pseudonym, is one such victim. She never imagined that a relationship she once cherished would end up destroying her life. After a difficult breakup, her ex-partner with whom she had a live-in relationship, sought revenge by sharing intimate videos and photos of her online with her family, friends, and relatives in 2022.For the next six months, her ex continued to sexually harass her through social media. The abuse only ceased after she attempted suicide, which resulted in a three-week hospitalisation.“Even after all this happened, my family refused to help me file a complaint. My relatives even mocked me, saying that I had already done intimate things during the live-in relationship. They said he wasn’t physically hurting or abusing me, so I should just get over it”, says Rita.According to a UN report based on studies in 10 countries, an estimated 95 percent of aggressive behaviour, harassment, abusive language, and degrading images online are directed at women, and they often come from partners or ex-partners.A year has passed for Rita, but the emotional scars remain, and she continues to struggle with depression.Many in Nepal, like Rita’s relatives, downplay the impact of online harassment, dismissing it as “just virtual, not physical.” However, a UN report titled ‘Combating Online Violence Against Women & Girls: A Worldwide Wake-Up Call,’ published by the UN Broadband Commission in 2015, tells a different story. It argues that ‘cyber touch’ can be as damaging as physical touch, suggesting that online abuse can be as bad as domestic violence or sexual assault.Now, as women across Nepal are celebrating Teej, many find themselves facing online violence. They are subjected to a barrage of hate speech simply for enjoying themselves.In recent years, the sight of women dancing, singing, drinking, and celebrating during Teej has sparked outrage among certain segments of society, particularly men who see these activities as a challenge to traditional gender roles. Social media trolls have seized on the opportunity to attack and criticise what they consider ‘inappropriate behaviour, clothing, and dance.’“Every year, it’s the same story,” says Ankita Chapagain, a 40-year-old from Kathmandu. “As soon as videos of women enjoying Teej and dancing go online, the hate comments start pouring in. We’re called names, our morals are questioned, and we’re blamed for the supposed degradation of society.”This animosity extends beyond anonymous trolls; it mirrors a deeper social unease with women’s independence and the pervasive misogyny and patriarchy in our culture. “It’s as if they can’t stand to see women happy and celebrating on their own terms,” Chapagain adds.The problem intensifies during elections, with female politicians facing significant online abuse. An analysis conducted by Panos South Asia reveals that insults and hate speech are the most common attacks on female politicians.A joint statement by the United Nations Special Rapporteurs on Violence against Women and Freedom of Expression says online violence against women can “chill and disrupt the online participation of women journalists, activists, human rights defenders, artists, and other public figures and private individuals” —which underscores the severe impact of growing cyber violence.So, how well-prepared are the institutions responsible for addressing this issue, like the Cyber Bureau? The answer seems to be, not very well.Superintendent of Police Deepak Raj Awasthi, spokesperson, and information officer of the Cyber Bureau, told the Post last month that the bureau is struggling with both understaffing and underfunding.The gap between the rise in cybercrimes and the lack of resources leaves the virtual realm a dangerous space, especially for girls and women who are already vulnerable due to unsafe physical environments, pervasive misogyny, and systemic discrimination. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nThe Khemlal-Harikala Lamichhane Samaaj Kalyan Pratisthan announced this year’s Padmashree Sahitya Puraskaar and Padmashree Sadhana Samman is to be conferred to Professor Krishna Gautam’s ‘Adwait’ and Sikkim’s former Chief minister Pawan Kumar Chamling respectively on Monday.The Academy’s President Jiba Lamichhane said that Gautam’s ‘Adwait’ states that the essence of humanity is one despite the belief in singularity, duality and pluralism. “Adwait is written in highly refined and understandable language and style highlighting the issue of establishing equality, empathy and solidarity in human society,” he said in a statement released on Monday.According to Lamichhane, out of 187 books submitted to the Academy, 15 were included in the extended list and five were shortlisted.Similarly, Chamling has been honoured with Padma Shree Sadhana Samman for his devotion to the Nepali language, culture and literature for a long time. Chamling had also been the chief minister of Sikkim from December 1994 to May 2019. Professor Dr Kedar Bhakta Mathema, former ambassador to Japan and vice-chancellor of Tribhuvan University has been chosen for the Padma Shree Gaurav Award for his continuous contribution to an equitable society. He has been a civil society activist for a long, Lamichhane said.He shared that each award comprises a cash prize of Rs 300,000 and a letter of appreciation. \nFollowing the split of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal led by Upendra Yadav on May 5, another fringe party is in the spotlight for similar reasons. According to party insiders, a group of dissidents has intensified activities with a plan to split the Madhav Kumar Nepal-led CPN (Unified Socialist), and to return to the mother party–CPN-UML.The dissidents are reportedly in negotiations with top UML leaders after they were either not selected as candidates or were defeated in the election of office bearers and Politburo members of the Unified Socialist.“Though I am not fully aware of dissident leaders’ recent moves, several leaders are not satisfied with the party, especially after the election of the office bearers,” said Keshav Lal Shrestha, who fought for the position of deputy party chair and got defeated.“Electing the party office bearers was not the mandate of the delegates to the general convention,” Shrestha told the Post.“In the Unified Socialist, there were various groups based on their opinions. To strengthen the newly formed party, we had agreed to choose the leadership in consensus. However, when the top three leaders were selected unanimously, they later decided to hold the election of office bearers, against the convention’s mandate.” During the election, top leaders issued different lists asking party representatives to elect those candidates as office bearers, Shrestha said. “When the party's top leaders themselves are guided by factional motives and cannot unify party members, why would other leaders still want to continue as party members?”Even though Shrestha did not admit that he was considering quitting the Unified Socialist, he didn’t deny that some party leaders were considering the move.The party's general convention, held in Kathmandu from June 30 to July 5, unanimously elected Madhav Nepal the chairman, Ghanashyam Bhusal general secretary, and Jhala Nath Khanal senior leader.After the general convention unanimously elected the chairman and general secretary, they had announced to pick office bearers in consensus. However, party insiders said leaders close to Nepal lobbied hard to hold an election for office bearers considering the party establishment’s strong hold on the party organisation.During the office bearers’ election on August 27, the Nepal-Bhusal camp contested some vital positions, and the Nepal camp leader won most of them.After being defeated as vice-chair, Ramkumari Jhakri, Ramchandra Jha, Keshav Lal Shrestha, and deputy general secretary candidates Amar Bahadur Thapa, Jeevanram Shrestha, and other leaders are allegedly considering rejoining their mother party, CPN-UML, according to a party insider. Jhakri, who played a vital role in establishing the Unified Socialist in 2021, has for the last couple of months been lobbying for the party’s merger with the CPN-UML.In an interview with the Post just ahead of the election, Jhakri acknowledged that the party should consider unification with the mother party, UML.However, Jhakri on Sunday said that despite some leaders’ grievances towards the party leadership, there are slim chances of the party being split as yet.“The way the party leaders are handling the party’s affairs has caused disenchantment within the organisation,” Jhakri told the Post. However, she denied that the dissident leaders were considering a break-up.“We are in regular touch with some of the dissident leaders of the party, as reported in the media, but they are not in a mood to split the party,” says Somnath Pandey, a party secretary. “The rumour of the party split spread mainly after three of the federal lawmakers of our party were not involved in the party’s election process,” Pandey told the Post. “But see no such possibility.”Prem Ale, Kishan Shrestha, and Dhan Bahadur Budha, three of the party's ten lawmakers, do not currently hold any of the party positions. When Shrestha and Budha were the party's central members, Ale did not renew his membership.Pandey claimed that Jhakri is one of the party leaders who has considered quitting. Jhakri said she had just arrived from Qatar after attending a function as a party leader, meaning that she was yet to get updates.If there are some grievances of leaders, the party will try to solve them, Pandey said.Jha, who is considered as a dissident leader, also denied that he was planning to quit the party. “I have some reservations over how the election of office bearers was conducted,” Jha told the Post. “The party's top leadership circulated lists of the leaders to be elected, which was a wrong practice. But I have my differences with the UML too, so there is no possibility of me rejoining the old party.”Jha said that since Ale, Shrestha, and Budha are directly elected lawmakers, they might have some issues with the party for not selecting them ministers when the party was in power. “Other leaders should have no issues.”Ashesh Ghimire, a Politburo member, dismissed the talk as rumour. “Yes, there certainly is gossip that some of our party leaders are considering rejoining the UML, but this won’t happen as outsiders expect,” Ghimire told the Post. “It has been reported that some of our party leaders also met with UML chair and Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli but this is unsubstantiated.” However, party insiders also claimed that in his meeting with some Unified Socialist leaders, Prime Minister Oli reportedly said that the government, before Dashain, will introduce an ordinance related to the political parties, making it easier for the dissidents to split the Unified Socialist. Ramsaran Bajgain, press coordinator for Prime Minister Oli, however, rubbished the claim. “The government is not considering issuing any ordinance to split a party at the moment,” Bajgain told the Post. Splitting a party currently has legal ambiguities. The Political Parties Act states that a group of party dissidents can split the organisation and form a new party if they can prove the support of at least 40 percent of the central committee members as well as at least 40 percent of the party’s lawmakers.In August 2021, the Sher Bahadur Deuba-led government issued the ordinance and changed the provision, enabling 20 percent of the central committee and 20 percent of lawmakers to form a new party. The law was then tweaked to help then-UML leader Madhav Nepal and Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal’s Mahantha Thakur launch their parties. However, this provision was nullified through an ordinance three years ago, immediately after the two parties split. After that, the government did not replace the ordinance, causing a legal void. Despite the legal ambiguities regarding the party's split, a group of leaders led by Ashok Rai of JSP-Nepal had split the party. With the support of six other lawmakers and 35 central committee members, Rai had split the party.Their party’s legal status is still unclear as their move to split the party has been challenged in the Supreme Court and the case is still sub judice. \nThe verbal war between the country’s two big communist forces—CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre)—continues to escalate with leaders from both parties targeting each other in different forums.The Maoist Centre got agitated after the UML pulled out its support to the government led by Pushpa Kamal Dahal, the Maoist chief, in the second week of July.The series of attacks and counter-attacks against each other is unlikely to stop anytime soon, leaders from both sides say.Prime Minister and UML chief KP Sharma Oli has warned the Maoist Centre to stop glamorising the violence it committed during the decade-long insurgency. He urged the Maoist leadership to stop glorifying such violence and asked them to be part of national development.The verbal war between the leaders of Oli’s party and the Maoist Centre intensified after lawmaker and UML Secretary Yogesh Bhattarai said in Parliament that the decade-long war waged by the Maoists against the state was “unfortunate”. In the House session on August 28, Bhattarai repeatedly termed the Maoist insurgency “violence”.“If the Maoist war was great, why did they abandon it?” Oli said days later. “Why did they join the peace process? If people’s war was great then it should have been successful but it was not. Later the peaceful movement became successful.”In one speech in Parliament, former prime minister Dahal warned that the fate of Nepali leaders could be similar to those of the ruling party leaders in Bangladesh as the recent incidents show and in Sri Lanka two years ago. Dahal went on to say that if the governing alliance of the Nepali Congress and the UML fails to address public aspirations, Nepal could face situations like in the two other South Asian nations.“You, not me, should learn from a lesson from Bangladesh,” Oli said, responding to Dahal, at an event on August 31. “Just yesterday, Prachanda ji [Dahal] reportedly advised me to learn lessons from Bangladesh and Sri Lanka. But have I killed 17,000 people so I would tremble with fear? Have I robbed the people?”Oli continued, “I do not need to fear anyone. It is Dahal who must learn from Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.”Oli also ruled out the possibility of Nepal becoming the next Sri Lanka or Bangladesh as Nepal’s history and tradition are different from those of the South Asian neighbours.At a function organised in Tundikhel on August 26 to mark Gaura Parva, some youths chanted slogans against Oli and Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba. That caused worries among Nepali leaders and analysts that growing frustration among the Nepali youths could lead to a political disaster in Nepal.The growing rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre has been discussed in both the parties. The two communist forces formed an alliance ahead of the parliamentary elections in 2017. The next year, they merged to become the largest party and governed the country for three years.But the unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre did not last long. A Supreme Court verdict split them in May 2021, ruling that the unified party’s name was illegal.Even after the 2022 elections, Oli and Dahal teamed up twice to run the government but their coalitions were not successful.“After our decision to contest the elections independently, Maoist comrades seem to have become more aggressive towards us,” a senior UML leader said. “Without our or the Nepali Congress’s support, the Maoist Centre is unlikely to retain the national party status after the next elections.” A recent politburo meeting of the UML concluded that the possibility of unity or alliance among leftist parties had been over. On the other hand, the Congress, which joined forces with the Maoist Centre and other parties during the last elections, has also decided to contest the elections single-handedly. “The decisions of the Nepali Congress and the UML to contest the elections on their own have come as big shocks for the Maoist Centre. So they are venting ire against us,” the UML leader said.Meanwhile, the Maoist Centre has issued a circular to its rank and file to be ready for street protests. The internal communication in the Maoist Centre has further irked the UML, which leads the government.Ram Karki, a Maoist Centre secretary, said the standoff between the UML and his party is likely to continue because there is anger among the Maoists against the UML for having unseated Dahal from power.“There is also a lack of commitment among the leaders on both sides, and a huge trust deficit,” said Karki. “The Maoist leadership has become paranoid after Nepali Congress decided not to forge an alliance for the next election.”He also blamed a lack of political culture and maturity among the communist leaders for the animosity.In his speech to Parliament on August 27, Dahal called the Oli-led government “corrupt and regressive”. Dahal’s fiery rhetoric has created ripples in the UML. Another cause of misunderstanding between the two parties is talk of constitution amendment, which the Congress and the UML agreed to before forming the coalition. Besides, some UML leaders including party general secretary Shankar Pokhrel advocate a two-party system, arguing that it is necessary for the country’s stability and development. Maoist leaders fear the two-party polarisation as that would threaten the existence of smaller parties. \nOn September 1, on the final day of the Nepali Congress Central Working Committee meeting, General Secretary Bishwa Prakash Sharma explicitly urged Sher Bahadur Deuba, the party president, to give up his aspirations to be the prime minister yet again.As per the seven-point agreement between the Congress and the CPN-UML on July 1, UML Chairman KP Sharma Oli, the incumbent prime minister, will lead the government for the first two years. Then Congress chief Deuba will lead the government until the elections in November-December 2027. Sharma urged Deuba to leave the prime minister’s post for another senior Congress leader. Deuba reportedly rejected the proposal outright.“I will not give up the position just because someone so desires,” Deuba reportedly said in response.Sharma, one of the two general secretaries of the country’s oldest political party, had proposed an exit policy in his contemporary political proposal tabled at the Mahasamiti meeting in February for the leaders holding state positions such as president, prime minister, ministers.Besides Sharma's proposal, the Mahasamiti also endorsed the papers submitted by Vice-president Purna Bahadur Khadka and General Secretary Gagan Thapa. However, it also gave room for the central committee to modify the proposal. When the central committee approved Khadka’s policy proposal and Thapa’s organisational proposal with minor changes, Sharma’s paper was pushed back to be considered while amending the national constitution.Sharma proposed one term for the [country’s] President, two terms for the prime minister, three terms for ministers, and four terms for lawmakers. Sharma’s proposal on term limits on persons serving as the country’s president or the prime minister is a national rather than the party’s issue, so it has been deferred, according to party leaders. Most of the Congress central leaders who spoke at the meeting, which lasted almost a month with gaps in between, claimed that fixing a time limit for the leadership was contrary to the democratic principle that the party champions.UML chief whip Mahesh Bartaula also says that since politics is a voluntary job, the politicians should be able to contribute to the society for as long as they want. “Nonetheless, the exit policy proposal is thought-provoking,” Bartaula told the Post. As a new generation of leaders is yet to be fully developed, the public still trusts the older crop of leaders, he argues. “Those vying for top positions are yet to gain the public’s credibility.”For Krishna Pokharel, a professor of political science, it would be unnatural to amend the constitution to address Sharma’s demand. “In countries where people directly elect their prime minister, amending the constitution to limit the executive head’s term could be reasonable” Pokharel told the Post. “However, in a country like Nepal where the parties choose the prime minister, exit policy should rather be mentioned in the party’s statute.” Had Nepali leaders internalised the spirit of the parliamentary system, their entry and exit points need not have been discussed. “The parliamentary system in Nepal has been vulgarised,” Pokharel added. According to political experts, despite the Congress leaders criticising the exit policy at the central committee, the proposal’s public appeal is growing. They see no alternative to its implementation, sooner or later. One reason for growing public disenchantment with political parties is that the same old faces have continued in leadership positions for a long time. If there were a term limit for a leader in a governmental or party position, people’s dissatisfaction would somehow be addressed.Experts say the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh and the political crisis of Sri Lanka two years ago were due to the continuous rule by a single person or a single family.One reason some democracies struggle is their political leaders’ unlimited hunger for power, Uddab Pyakurel, a political analyst, told the Post. “In Nordic countries, there is no need to set term limits for leaders as there is already a strong democratic culture there.” Despite having leaders like Donald Trump, American democracy still works, partly because of the term limits, Pyakurel reasoned. “If Nepal is to strengthen its democratic system, it must implement the exit policy for political leaders,” he said. Some political experts see problems even after introducing a term limit.Arguing that limiting the tenure for top positions alone is not enough to put curbs on autocratic tendencies, Khagendra Prasai, another political analyst, said: “The major issue is developing political mannerism and culture.”Calls for the top party leadership making way for a new generation are growing not just in the Congress. Even during the CPN (Maoist Centre) standing committee meeting last month, Deputy General Secretary Janardan Sharma questioned Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s uninterrupted leadership for nearly 35 years. Sharma even urged Dahal to resign the position. Experts say leaders with limited terms realise they must get a lot done within the given time at the top. There is no slow cooldown period. The current set of top party leaders—Deuba, Oli and Dahal in particular—have been in power for two or three decades, repeatedly assuming the country’s top executive position. Article 216 (7) of the Constitution of Nepal says a person elected mayor for two terms will not be eligible to be a candidate in future municipal elections. Article 215 (7) has a similar provision for chairpersons of rural municipalities.The constitution also has a two-term limit for President.While all other top governing posts come with fixed terms, there are limits on how many times the prime minister, chief ministers, ministers, and lawmakers can serve. This allows politicians to occupy office for as long as they choose, preventing the leadership handover to the next generation. In the view of Mighendra Bahadur Karki, executive director of the Centre for Nepal and Asia Studies (CNAS) at Tribhuvan University: “Leaders who know that their peers, even junior colleagues, may someday be their supervisors may be more thoughtful of their behaviour. Poor behaviour and status anxiety might be reduced, increasing the room for collaboration.” If senior leaders know that they need to bow out of the government or the party after a particular time, they are more likely to train and promote junior leaders to take their place, Karki told the Post. “This in turn will cultivate a healthy political culture.”But he warned that the question of term limit is not straightforward. “The exit policy, if it is to be implemented, should be system-centric rather than targeting particular leaders.” \nThe government has approved the upcoming visit of Prime Minister KP Oli to New York to attend the 79th United Nations General Assembly.This will be Oli’s first foreign visit after he assumed office on July 15. Prime Minister Oli will lead the Nepali delegation to the United Nations General Assembly. He is scheduled to address the assembly, take part in the Summit of the Future to be organised by UN General Secretary Antonio Guterres and will hold talks with several world leaders on the sidelines of the general assembly.The prime minister will address the UN General Assembly on September 26.“We have sent requests to several world leaders for a meeting with the prime minister on the sidelines of the general assembly,” said a senior foreign ministry official. “We will receive the confirmations gradually.”A Cabinet meeting on Thursday approved the prime minister’s UN visit, said Prithvi Subba Gurung, who is the government spokesperson. The prime minister will embark on a 11-day-long visit to the United Nations, he said.The prime minister will lead the official delegation of 19 people, including his spouse Radhika Shakya, Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel, Foreign Minister Arzu Rana, adviser to Prime Minister Bishnu Rimal, senior government officials, media persons, security personnel, and private doctors, among others.Foreign Minister Rana, who is all set to visit Canada ahead of the UN General Assembly, will join the delegation in New York from Canada.The prime minister and the Nepali delegation will leave for New York on September 20. Oli will participate in the Summit of the Future on September 22 and 23, according to a senior foreign ministry official. “This time, the prime minister will engage in an interaction at Columbia University on September 25 on the topic of ‘Nepal's journey to democracy and economic prosperity’.”Two former prime ministers Sher Bahadur Deuba and Madhav Kumar Nepal had earlier addressed and interacted at Columbia University, considered one of the most prestigious universities in the world. On September 26, the prime minister will address the UN General Assembly and will brief world leaders about recent agreements on Nepal’s peace process and Nepal’s push for climate justice, among other things. \nThe CPN-UML, Nepal’s largest communist party, has apparently forestalled unity among leftist parties. Concluding its two-day politburo meeting on Wednesday, the ruling party has decided against forging electoral alliances with other communist forces.During the meeting of the high-ranking decision-making body, some UML leaders had questioned the potential for unity with leftist parties like the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the upcoming elections. However, KP Sharma Oli, the party chairman and prime minister, dismissed the possibility, saying, “As the Nepali Congress has decided to contest the upcoming elections on its own, it is time for us to do the same and go to the elections independently.”The Nepali Congress and the UML have been archrivals in Nepali politics since the restoration of democracy in 1990. Despite this, they have also formed several governments together in the past, even while competing fiercely during elections and in leading the country.With the rise of new political forces and a strong rival like the Congress, some UML leaders had expressed concern that the party could face a serious threat in the upcoming elections. They suggested forging alliances with other communist parties or forming a “leftist” bloc ahead of the general and provincial elections scheduled for 2027.However, Chairman Oli dismissed the idea, saying, “There is no need to form such alliances, fronts, or unity among leftist parties. We don’t need such unity.”According to Rajendra Gautam, head of the party's publicity department, some leaders were curious about the possibility of a leftist alliance in the upcoming elections. However, Oli, citing the Nepali Congress’ decision to contest the elections solo, reiterated that unity among leftist parties is neither possible nor necessary, according to leaders.In 2017, the UML had forged an alliance with the Maoist Centre and contested the elections under the banner of a broader leftist unity. The alliance yielded strong results, securing a majority of seats, but it fell apart by mid-2021.According to a UML politburo member, there are several reasons behind the party’s decision not to pursue a similar alliance this time. “First, the UML is currently leading the incumbent government with the support of Nepali Congress. Second, there is a good trust between Oli and Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba. Since the two parties came together to form a government based on a seven-point agreement, it wouldn’t be a wise move to antagonise the Congress by forming alliance with other parties,” the member explained.“Third, the Congress’ decision to contest the elections independently prompted us to do the same. And fourth, the widening rift between the UML and the Maoist Centre in recent days also contributed to the decision to go it alone.”There are also strong voices within the UML that the party should not carry the burden of the Maoists into the upcoming elections, said the politburo member, adding, “We have already learned a lesson from our past decision to unite the party with the Maoists.In the politburo meeting, some leaders argued that the old model of left unity did not work. “So if an alliance with leftist parties is necessary, it should focus on unity with party cadres and supporters, rather than the leadership,” said Bishal Bhattarai, another member of the UML politburo.“We have a very painful history of failed unity among the left parties,” Bhattari added. “Therefore, we now have to opt for the new model where serious discussion and deliberation on ideology, organisation, and other critical issues would be discussed before forging any alliances.”He said the past unity between the UML and the Maoist Centre left a bad impression on the public. “Next time, if we consider leftist unity, we have to be careful, and engage in detailed discussions and deliberation,” said Bhattarai.The meeting also decided to give continuity to the partnership with the Nepali Congress and oppose any efforts at leftist unity. Also, the party has vowed to address growing issues of indiscipline and disorderly activities, so that the party could emerge as a strong national force in the 2027 elections.In his address, Oli had reviewed the current political situation, the government’s performance, and outlined future priorities. He urged the party members to work together to make the party’s Mission 2084 [2027 elections] a grand success. The UML has already launched several campaigns targeting the next elections. A total of 51 politburo members shared their suggestions and feedback during the meeting, where party general secretary Shanker Pokhrel presented a proposal to position the UML as a decisive national force. The meeting also provided several suggestions to improve the government’s functioning. \nPanic gripped locals in ward 12 of Chandragiri Municipality, Kathmandu, on Thursday morning after a suspicious object was found in the locality.The suspicious object was spotted in front of Balambu Secondary School, sparking fears of a bomb threat.Locals informed the police, and a bomb disposal team from the Nepal Army arrived at the scene. According to the NA Directorate of Public Relations and Information, the team disposed of the suspicious object, which turned out to be a pressure cooker.   \nKathmandu Metropolitan City has extended the area to prohibit building any structure on either side of the rivers in its territory.In a notice on Wednesday, the city office stated that construction of any structure has been barred on the additional 20 meters from the existing prohibited area.According to the metropolis notice, if the city has, under the existing rule, prohibited any construction on 20 meters from the area marked as river, the prohibited area will now be altogether 40 meters on either side of the waterway.The metropolis said the decision was taken based on a recent Supreme Court verdict that directed the authorities concerned to prohibit construction within an additional 20 metres from riverbanks in the Kathmandu Valley.Currently, construction is permitted only 20 metres beyond major riverbanks in the Kathmandu metropolis.The notice issued by the metropolis states, “No construction will be permitted on an additional 20 metres of land on either side of the river, and ongoing construction will be halted.”It has also asked one and all not to release contaminated water, including sewage, into Bagmati River and its tributaries. “Private and government buildings, as well as commercial properties, must install soak pits for groundwater recharge,” it said. “Waste must not be disposed of in the rivers. Non-compliance will lead to legal action under existing laws.” \nThe rhythmic beat of the Dha echoes through a Bhaktapur alley, blending with the energetic footsteps of dancers. Bhaktapur, which sees jatras and festivals round the year, is no stranger to music, dance and celebrations. But this is not an ordinary occasion. The performers in question are Lakhe dancers who are reviving the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance after a century.The young dancers are preparing for Indra Jatra this year, where mask-clad Lakhe dancers roam the streets to rid the community of hardships and suffering. Lakhe, demon deities revered as protectors of people and crops, are thought to reside in the demonic mask. As the dancer dons the mask, the spirit is said to take over.Bhaktapur was once a key site for the Ranjitkar Lakhe performances, but the art form vanished from the city after the 1934 earthquake.“Bhaktapur suffered the most damage during the 1934 earthquake,\" says Ganesh Ram Ranjit, treasurer of the Ranjitkar Group’s Bhaktapur branch. “The destruction left residents struggling to recover for a decade, making it nearly impossible to perform the costly Lakhe dance.”The Ranjitkar Group discovered the extinct dance in the year the group was established. They located a Lakhe temple in Bhaktapur that had closed after the earthquake. After two years of research, they learned that performing the Lakhe dance was seen as a good omen in Bhaktapur and involved hosting community feasts. However, the high cost of this tradition forced many to sell their properties, rendering it unfeasible in the city’s post-earthquake conditions. Over time, the dance was abandoned as more lands supporting these cultural events were lost during rapid urbanisation.“There was a significant decline in our engagement with our cultural heritage,” says Rabi Shakya, a sculptor and Lakhe dance teacher training the new dancers. “The encouraging change now is the strong interest from the new generation, which is making it possible to revive intangible heritage like this dance.”After 100 years, the Ranjitkar Lakhe Dance is making a return to Bhaktapur at this year’s Indra Jatra.“It’s challenging to accurately re-enact the dance since it hasn’t been seen in a century,” Shakya notes. “As a sculptor, I drew inspiration from Bhaktapur’s revered Shree Navadurga Bhawani to create the Lakhe’s mask.” Similarly, the dance was choreographed by studying Lakhe dances from Kathmandu, Patan, and Banepa within the Ranjitkar community, and combining them with traditional steps from Bhaktapur Lakhe dances.“As for the musical instruments, we are using traditional instruments like Dha, Dhime, and Ponga, which are said to excite the Lakhe,” says Rajendra Maharjan, Lakhe dance teacher and musician.Maharjan is one of the experienced Newari arts teachers working to revive the lost Lakhe dance. He is involved in training young students in cultural arts and is now dedicated to the Ranjitkar dance training, with the students practising together nearly every day.“Becoming a Lakhe performer involves more than just wearing the costume and mask,” said Sudin Ranjit, a Lakhe dance student. “We must train extensively with our teachers, and it demands a lot of hard work.”To Ranjit, a resident of Bhaktapur, the training is more than learning a new craft; it is a matter of protecting culture. Growing up only interested in instruments, he slowly understood how important continuing cultural practices like Lakhe dances is for their community.“The dance will not only bolster Bhaktapur’s cultural pride but also boost tourism and create jobs,” says Dr Purushottam Lochan Shrestha, a professor and researcher specialising in Bhaktapur and Newari culture.Shrestha notes that reviving the dance would offer employment to everyone involved, from the dancers and the sculptor making the masks to those participating in the rituals. “Economic centres throughout the city, from small businesses to large industries, will benefit from the influx of tourists attracted by the Lakhe dance,” Shrestha adds, commending the Ranjitkar group's initiative.Once the Ranjitkar community revitalises the Lakhe dance, the Ranjitkar group plans to set up a new Guthi house with a fresh community fund and organise annual events for the dance.“The Lakhe dance won’t let them separate,” Shakya remarks.In today’s globalised world, where identity often merges into a homogenised blend, shared cultural practices provide a sense of connection and belonging. This new Lakhe dance embodies that spirit of togetherness for the community involved.“Reviving the dance after 100 years,” Shakya says, “is about preserving our culture for the next 300 years.” \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \n\nAll Ncell customers can now enjoy TikTok.

This means all Sadhain ON pack customers can now use TikTok with free data, alongside other social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube. “It is indeed a positive step for the industry as well as customers that the ban on the popular social media platform TikTok has been lifted, and we would like to thank the government of Nepal,\" said Umair Mohsin, Chief Commercial Officer of Ncell. “Effective today (Friday), we also introduced the TikTok Pack, which provides access to TikTok at an affordable rate. We have also included TikTok in the social media list of our Sadhain ON packs. We believe this will make accessing TikTok even easier for our valued customers.” \n\nNepali health officials have reported at least six deaths and 36 infections from the deadly Japanese encephalitis (JE) virus since the start of the monsoon season this year.According to the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services, several districts, including Kailali, have reported both deaths and infections from the deadly virus.“Six deaths and 36 cases of infection have been reported so far this year from various districts,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the section. “Last year, there were five deaths and 107 cases of Japanese encephalitis infections.”Japanese encephalitis is a viral brain infection caused by the JE virus, which is endemic in Asia and parts of the Western Pacific. According to the World Health Organization, it is a mosquito-borne flavivirus with the same genus as dengue, Zika, yellow fever, and West Nile viruses. The case-fatality rate among those infected can be as high as 30 percent. Permanent neurologic, cognitive, and behavioural sequelae occur in 30 to 50 percent of those with encephalitis, according to the UN health body.Doctors say the disease has no cure, so they provide only symptomatic treatment. Safe and effective vaccines are available to prevent the JE infection. Nepal has included the vaccine in its routine immunisation list, which the government provides free of cost to all children.Even though the vaccine is included in the regular immunisation list, several people die and dozens get infected by the deadly virus every year.The Health Directorate of Sudurpaschim Province, reported that two patients—a nine-year-old boy from ward 5 and a 60-year-old man from ward 6 of Ghodaghodi Municipality of the district—died from the infection.“The National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out serological tests, confirmed the virus in both deceased and infected patients,” Dr Khagendra Bam, acting director of the directorate, told the Post over the phone from Doti. “Four others receiving treatment at hospitals are from adjoining Gauriganga Municipality, and their conditions are stable.”Officials say they are currently collecting data on under-five children to administer the vaccine. However, officials at the Health Ministry said that there are no immediate plans for additional vaccination drives in the disease-hit areas.“Deaths and infections from JE are reported every year, as the disease is endemic in our country,” said Gautam. “But the number of deaths and infections has significantly decreased compared to the past.”Officials said that in the past, dozens of people would die, and around 600 would be infected by the JE virus each year. Doctors advise taking precautions to avoid mosquito bites, such as using mosquito repellents, wearing long-sleeved clothes, and getting vaccinated if one lives in or is travelling to disease-endemic areas. They also stress the importance of awareness and timely treatment to prevent infections and deaths. \nUpon assuming office, Minister for Health and Population Pradip Paudel vowed to end the long waiting lines at public hospitals within a month of his appointment. He then pledged to raise the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 soon.But neither have the long waiting lines at the state-run health facilities ended, nor have serious discussions been held yet to increase government health insurance coverage.And now, the Ministry of Health and Population has issued a circular to all agencies concerned to implement the cabinet decision of running outpatient care on public holidays.Multiple experts the Post talked to, including doctors, retired bureaucrats, and representatives of the Nepal Medical Association, said that it is easier said than done and suggested that Health Minister Paudel should consult with experts before making any decision.“Many state-run hospitals have not even been able to run extended services,” said Dr Senendra Upreti, the former health secretary. “Decisions to end waiting lists at state-run hospitals, increase coverage of the health insurance scheme and run patient care on public holidays sound too good, but one should also know about the challenges of implementing those decisions. Long waiting lists at the hospitals should have ended as of now if it was so easy to do.”Most health ministers visit state-run hospitals upon assuming office and direct officials concerned to end the long waiting lists, commit to increasing human resources, and provide a required budget to ease patients’ suffering.Doctors say people have not expected the repetition of the same commitments from the new minister, from whom they have expected some changes.“Why would one serve on public holidays without any incentive, and how could the government force only health workers to serve on public holidays, not other civil servants?” questioned Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, a retired chief specialist at the Health Ministry. “I didn’t find other countries providing outpatient care on public holidays.”Upreti, who also served as chairman of the Health Insurance Board, said the minister's commitment to increase the coverage of the government’s health insurance scheme to Rs500,000 shortly shows his ignorance about the ground reality. The government pays a premium of over 50 percent of those enrolled in the scheme and has to allocate additional billions of rupees to reimburse the hospitals. Due to the government’s inability to reimburse hospitals on time, many hospitals threaten to stop providing the scheme every year.Public health experts say the government has not increased human resources in state-run hospitals in the last 30 years. Despite that, the number of patients seeking health care has increased manifold, and the capacity and budget of health facilities have not increased accordingly. They said that all staffers are needed to run health facilities on public holidays, and the government has not allocated an additional budget to run health facilities on public holidays.“I have suggested the new health minister to start from small things,” said Shrestha. “He might have thought that ending long waiting lists in state-run hospitals is trivial, but it is not so trivial. I have also asked him to hold staffers of the Health Ministry until office hours first.”Meanwhile, the Nepal Medical Association, the umbrella organisation of medical doctors, has protested against the decision to run outpatient departments on public holidays.Issuing a statement on Tuesday, the association sought the government’s attention to the lack of human resources in the state-run health facilities.“No new post has been created in the last 33 years,” said Dr Anil Bikram Karki, chairman of the association. “Doctors have already been working 72 hours a week despite not being incentivised to work during the Covid-19 pandemic. We have strong reservations against the decision to run outpatient care on public holidays without offering incentives to health workers and increasing the human resources.”Doctors say the long waiting lines in state-run health facilities will end if the government creates additional posts for health workers, including doctors, and makes the referral mechanism systematic.They said patients should not be forced to visit Kathmandu to examine minor health problems. Instead, health workers and services should be made available in the local health facilities, human resources should be increased, and more budget should be allocated.“If we have problems with long waiting lines in hospitals, citizens have to endure long queues while accessing public service,” said Karki. “Doctors never deny emergency services, but one should not mix emergency care with elective care [planned medical care]. We should acknowledge that doctors are human beings. They, too, have families and will be stressed and burnt out if they are forced to work continuously.” \nOver 3,500 people across the country have been infected with scrub typhus since mid-July, the start of this fiscal year.Officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division say they expect more cases in the coming days as the disease typically peaks in September.“Like in previous years, hundreds of people have also been infected with scrub typhus this year,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of vector Control Section at the division. “More people can get infected in the coming days, as the peak season is still ahead.”Scrub typhus, or bush typhus, is an infectious disease caused by the parasite Orientia tsutsugamushi, a mite-borne bacterium. It spreads in humans when bitten by infected chiggers (larval mites) found in mice.Until a few years ago, it was believed that people residing in rural areas or those working in grasslands or fields were at high risk. However, urban populations are also now being affected by the disease.“Over 100 people from Hetauda Sub-metropolitan city have been infected from Scrub typhus this year,” said Krishna Bahadur Major, chief of the Health Office, Makawanpur. “Although more cases are reported in villages, urban areas are not immune, with several positive cases emerging there as well.”Doctors point out high fever, headache, abdominal pain, backache, joint and muscle pain, red rash, nausea and vomiting as some of the symptoms of scrub typhus infection. Patients with severe illness may develop bleeding which could lead to organ failure. The infection can lead to respiratory distress, inflation of brain, lungs, kidney failure and then multi-organ failure. If not treated immediately, it could be fatal.Nepal saw a surge in scrub typhus cases after the calamitous 2015 earthquakes that killed nearly 9,000 persons across the country.Three months after the quakes, the BP Koirala Institute of Health Sciences, Dharan, alerted the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division about six children with unusual fevers and severe respiratory problems.Serum samples were collected for subsequent tests in Kathmandu and Bangkok, which confirmed a scrub typhus outbreak. By then, four children had already died in the course of the treatment. By the end of the year, 101 cases were confirmed in 16 districts, and four more people succumbed to the disease.The magnitude of the outbreak escalated in 2016 when 831 cases of scrub typhus were reported in 47 districts, and 14 people died by the end of that year.According to the Ministry of Health and Population data, more than 1,026 people were infected with the disease in 2020. Their number increased to 1,999 in 2021, and it rose to more than 2,900 in 2022.In 2023, over 5,000 people were infected with the deadly disease. Doctors say the risk of severity and fatality can be minimised if the patients are diagnosed and treated early, they say.Ordinary antibiotics, such as doxycycline and azithromycin, which are on the essential drugs list supplied by the government to health facilities across the country for free distribution, can cure the disease.However, what is concerning is that many health workers, including doctors, lack sufficient knowledge about diagnosing scrub typhus. Many health facilities also lack reagents to carry out tests for the disease.Doctors can diagnose the disease based on the symptoms, but the risk of misdiagnosis is high, as scrub typhus symptoms are similar to those of other illnesses. They warn that waiting for lab results before starting treatment could be dangerous. It can take about a week to get lab results, and by that time, if the patient is not treated can fall into a coma and suffer multi-organ failure. \nSeriously ill patients at District Hospital Sankhuwasabha are squeezed into every available space besides the beds: corridors, the floor, chairs, and even the storeroom, and outside on the hospital compound.With the spike in new cases of water-borne, viral fever and vector-borne diseases, mostly dengue, the hospital is struggling to cope.“Every day, around two dozen seriously ill patients end up sleeping on the corridor floor and in other areas,” Dr Pranam Jayaru, medical superintendent at the district hospital, told the Post over the phone from Khandbari, the district headquarters. “Our health workers have been working overtime to provide care, but we lack even the most basic supplies like IV stands. Patients’ visitors have to hold the IV bags or we have to improvise by tying them to windows.”This situation is becoming increasingly common in hospitals in many districts, which are seeing a spike in patient numbers amid a massive dengue outbreak. The virus has spread to 75 of the country’s 77 districts, killing at least three people and infecting 5,119 others since January. Two mountain districts—Humla and Mustang—have yet to record dengue cases this year. “For the last three years, we have witnessed a dengue epidemic during the monsoon season,” said Jayaru. “We can only request our staff to serve extra hours, but cannot provide equipment or expand bed numbers.”Doctors say most patients do not want to be referred to other places, as reaching Dharan, the nearest city, in an ambulance takes over six hours. Holding seriously ill patients in ill-equipped hospitals is risky as they lack consultant doctors, blood transfusion services, and high-tech laboratories, among other things.Experts say the deadly virus outbreak in most mountain districts and all hill districts shows the impact of climate change on Nepal’s healthcare system. Despite these challenges, no effective mitigation measures have been adopted.Many hospitals are overwhelmed by the influx of patients, and health workers are forced to place seriously ill patients in corridors and other makeshift spaces, compromising patient safety.“Our health facilities are not equipped to endure the climate crisis,” said Dr Meghnath Dhimal, chief researcher at the Nepal Health Research Council. “Many are built on hilltops or riverbanks, both vulnerable to climate impacts. These health facilities are also unprepared for emerging problems and spiking patient flow.”Of the 5,119 cases of the dengue cases reported, only 77 cases are from Madhesh Province, which is traditionally an endemic area. Health Ministry officials admit that the disease is shifting towards hills and mountain regions due to climate change. They say other factors, such as increased mobility and improved transportation, are also contributing to the spread of the disease to new areas. “Yes, new challenges have increased in areas previously considered less risky, but we have not strengthened our health facilities to deal with the emerging challenges accordingly,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Our health system is not is not designed to address these evolving risks.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. According to the World Health Organization, the same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and the Zika virus.In 2023, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus across the country.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.Back in 2019, dengue killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Dengue has become a year-round threat in Nepal over the past few years with cases consistently rising each year.Epidemiologists as well as virologists now consider the dengue virus as a major public health problem in Nepal. They also say that despite thousands of persons getting infected and scores dying from the disease, the authorities have not taken the situation seriously. The lackadaisical approach, they believe, is contributing to the spread of the virus. They call for implementing measures such as search-and-destroy drives and awareness campaigns to control dengue vectors.A report by the United Nations titled “Climate Change 2022: Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability” states that at least six major vector-borne diseases have recently emerged in Nepal and are now considered endemic, with climate change implicated as the primary driver.The report also showed increasing evidence that climate change has extended the elevational distribution of Anopheles, Culex and Aedes mosquitoes, which carry viruses to above 2,000 metres in Nepal.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and other discarded objects such as plastic cups and bottles could be breeding grounds for the dengue-carrying mosquitoes.Symptoms of dengue include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache and pain in the eyes, doctors say. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and access to proper medical care can prevent death. \nIn a bid to monitor the nutrition status of the population, the Ministry of Health and Population is planning to carry out a nutrition assessment survey in all districts throughout the country in the ongoing fiscal year.Officials said the nutrition status of pregnant women, children under five, adolescents, and new mothers will be monitored during the survey.“We will first assess the nutrition condition of the people of specific age groups and then share the findings with relevant agencies, including the Ministry of Health and Population,” said Lila Bikram Thapa, chief of the Nutrition Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “The nutrition assessment survey is crucial for getting the latest picture of the nutrition status of the population.”Malnutrition is a silent crisis in Nepal. The country has made significant progress in reducing stunting among children under five. According to the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 report, stunting decreased from 57 percent in 2001 to 25 percent in 2022.Wasting, a debilitating disease that causes muscle and fat tissues to waste away among children under five, decreased from 11 percent in 2001 to eight percent in 2022.Wasting or low weight for one’s height in children, if not treated properly and on time, is associated with a higher mortality risk, according to the World Health Organisation.Even though the health survey report showed some improvement in the country’s overall nutrition status, progress is not the same in all provinces. More than 16 percent of the children under five years in Lumbini Province are found to be suffering from wasting—the most immediate, visible, and life-threatening form of malnutrition.Likewise, around 10 percent of children under the age of five years in Madhesh Province have been found suffering from wasting.Officials said the new study was required to determine the latest progress on the population's nutrition conditions.“The nutrition status of the adolescent population will be monitored by schools, while health facilities will monitor children, pregnant women, and new mothers,” said Thapa. “Health workers will also take classes in schools to educate students about the importance of good nutrition and counsel pregnant women and new mothers at health facilities.”Along with the lack of sufficient nutrient foods, poor sanitation and lack of safe drinking water and treatment are blamed for wasting.Doctors say malnutrition during pregnancy increases the risk of complications and maternal and neonatal deaths, as well as the likelihood of low birth weight. It is a major impediment to growth, affecting human capital and economic productivity of a country.Experts say nutrition is directly linked to the country's overall development. Malnutrition affects children's physical and mental growth, which ultimately affects the country’s economic health.It weakens intellectual capacity, limits productivity in adulthood, and increases vulnerability to certain diseases.Nutritionists ask authorities to promote locally available foods, educate people about the importance of a nutritious diet, and provide fortified flour to improve nutritional conditions and reduce dependency on freely distributed foods.Nepal also has an international obligation to improve the condition of malnourished children.To meet the SDG targets, the country needs to reduce stunting to 15 percent from the current 32 percent by 2030, wasting to four percent from the current eight percent, underweight condition to 10 percent from the existing 19 percent, and anaemia to 10 percent from more than 43 percent at present.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals, (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality worldwide by 2030, and Nepal has committed to meeting the goals. \nDusit Princess Kathmandu is organising a five-day trout festival at its SOI restaurant. The dishes will be available for order from 12:30 pm to 10:00 pm every day till August 30. In celebration of Nepal’s rivers and lakes, which provide an ideal environment for high-quality trout, the Director of Culinary Food and Beverage Service, Chef Utpal Mondal, and his team at Dusit Princess Kathmandu have crafted a menu showcasing the flavours and versatility of locally sourced trout. “As the festive month of Shrawan ends, people focus on healthy and nutritious food. Trout, rich in omega-3 fatty acids, vitamins, and essential minerals, offers a heart-friendly option that checks all the boxes from a nutritional and culinary standpoint,” says Mondal.He adds that the goal of the culinary event is to offer their guests a rare opportunity to experience a wide variety of trout dishes they wouldn’t typically find at home.The event menu features twelve unique dishes, six of which are drawn from diverse culinary traditions across continents. Three dishes are inspired by oriental cuisine, while the remaining three highlight flavours from Nepal and India. The menu has been designed to include various dishes, from soups and starters to main courses, including Mexican, Italian, Continental, and Thai flavours.While discussing the event’s highlights, Mondal said, “The celebration presents a unique opportunity for guests to indulge in a diverse range of trout-based dishes, something they wouldn’t typically have the chance to experience elsewhere.” \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek offers panoramic views of Himalayan peaks, Janaki Mandir showcases Mughal architecture and houses an idol of Sita, Kuri Village offers snow-capped landscapes and panoramic mountain views, Annapurna Base Camp trek leads to the foothills of Annapurna South, Bardiya National Park is home to Royal Bengal Tigers, Khaptad National Park boasts diverse ecosystems and pristine beauty, and Limi Valley exhibits ancient monasteries and Tibetan-influenced culture.\nAfter an arduous journey, the author returns to their hometown, Phidim, discovering its remarkable transformation over the years, marked by urbanization, a lack of opportunities, and a transition to a transit town for pilgrims.\nNSJF Pulsar Sports Award 2080 announced nominees for Male, Female, Youth, and Coach of the Year categories, scheduling award ceremony for September 13th\nEngland allrounder Moeen Ali retires from international cricket after 68 Tests, 138 ODIs, and 92 T20Is, including World Cup victories in 2019 and 2022.\nChina suffered a record 7-0 loss to Japan in a World Cup qualifier, a humiliation that prompted coach Ivankovic to lament the toughest night of his career.\nKoshi Province preserved their unbeaten start in the ANFA Women’s League as they defeated Bagmati Youth Club 2-1 to register their second victory in as many games at the ANFA Complex in Lalitpur on Thursday.Bishnu Maya Bal had given Bagmati the lead in the 26th minute but Samikshya Magar’s goal three minutes later and an own goal from Divya Yasmali Magar fired Koshi to the summit after the first round.It was the season's first defeat for Bagmati, who had thrashed Sudurpaschim Province 5-1 in the opening round.Koshi, who thumped Waling Municipality 4-0 in the league opener, looked the better side from the start and contained Bagmati in their own half most of the time. But it was Bagmati who took the lead against the run of play after Koshi defenders’s failed attempt to clear a corner allowed Bal to cleverly place the ball into the second bar, leaving Koshi goalkeeper Buli Sarkar helpless.Koshi cut short the mourning period and were level only three minutes later after Bagmati goalie Karun Budhathoki failed to stop a long-ranged effort from Samikshya.Koshi went 2-1 up after 54 minutes with the help of an own Bagmati goal. Bagmati’s Yamsali’s attempt to block a powerful shot from Koshi’s Pratiksha Rai duped goalkeeper Budhathoki before finding the net.Asmita Khawas, who scored a hat-trick against Sudurpaschim on Monday, reached closer to finding the equaliser in the 64th minute when Sanu Maya Waiba brilliantly set her up with a long pass just inside the arc of the area but Khawas’s attempt to put a header over the advancing goalie Sarkar lacked enough firepower.Bagmati pressed for an equaliser in the final minutes but could not find the net. In the day’s other action, Waling Municipality bounced back from their opening loss to beat Karnali Province 4-0 later in the afternoon.Jackline Nassali scored a hat-trick and Sukriya Miya added their fourth to give Waling their first three points.Waling brought three Ugandan players to strengthen their squad and it paid immediate dividends as Nassali gave her side the lead in the 10th minute converting a pass from Miya.Nassali doubled the lead in the 41st minute. Her Ugandan compatriot Viola Nantongo was the provider. Viola’s perfectly placed freekick beat the offside trap and Nassali launched a volley past the advancing Karnali goalkeeper Lila Joshi.Nassali then completed her hat-trick—second of the league—in the 73rd minute from close range after good work from Anjali Machamasi.Miya wrapped up a convincing victory with a tight-angled shot that hit the upright before going in.Karnali have one point, earned from a 1-1 draw against Chandrapur Municipality on Tuesday. \nIsraeli airstrikes killed 16 people in western Syria and wounded dozens more overnight, Syrian state media reported on Monday, the deadliest Israeli attack reported by Syrian authorities since the Iranian embassy compound in Damascus was hit in April.There was no immediate comment from Israel, which typically remains silent on reports of strikes in Syria.The Syrian state news agency SANA, citing a military source, said Israel had launched the strikes at around 11:20 p.m. (2020 GMT on Sunday and targeted “a number of military sites in the central region”, without elaborating on what was struck.Syrian air defences had shot down some of the missiles, the source said. SANA cited a local health official as saying 36 people had been wounded, six of whom were in serious condition.Two regional intelligence sources said a major military research centre for chemical arms production located near Masyaf, in Hama province near the Mediterranean coast, had been hit several times. They said it was believed to house a team of Iranian military experts involved in weapons production.However, a senior regional military source close to Damascus and Tehran denied the accounts that it was a chemical weapons facility, saying that the target was a well-known Syrian research facility.The Syrian foreign ministry condemned the attack as an act of blatant aggression. In addition to the 16 fatalities and 36 wounded, it had caused “material damage to some residential areas”, it said in a statement reported by SANA.Iran's foreign minister spokesperson Nasser Kanaani said Tehran strongly condemned the “criminal attack” in Syria.“We do not confirm what was reported by media outlets linked to the Zionist regime (Israel) about an attack on an Iranian centre or a centre under Iran's protection,” he said during a news conference, in response to a question about the attack.Syrian state media also reported that the strikes caused two fires, which firefighters were working to extinguish.Israel has for years been targeting what it has described as Iranian or Iran-backed targets in Syria, where Iranian forces and Tehran-backed militias deployed widely to support President Bashar al-Assad during Syria's civil war.It has stepped up the campaign since the Oct. 7 Hamas-led assault on Israel from Gaza, including the April 1 attack that hit the Iranian embassy compound and killed senior Iranian commanders including one of Tehran's top generals. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nUnauthorized book translations and piracy in Nepal's market are rampant, harming authors, publishers, and readers, despite existing copyright laws that prohibit such practices.\nLawmakers’ brazen but futile attempt to impose a five-year statute of limitations on corruption cases lays bare not only the extent of corruption in Nepal but also how far they will go to absolve the corrupt from wrongdoing. Members of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of parliament are working to finalise the bill to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, which is the prime corruption law of the land. After widespread public objection for weeks over the amendment, Home Minister Ramesh Lekhak informed the committee in late August that the KP Oli-led government would no longer proceed with the proposed amendment. But the withdrawal raises more questions than answers. The issue in question involves Section 45 of the Act, which states that public servants can be prosecuted for corruption they committed on the job even after they leave office. Plain and simple! It sets no time limit within which legal proceedings may be initiated. However, the proposed bill does, dividing Section 45 into three different Sub-sections, of which Sub-section 1 requires that a corruption case must be prosecuted within five years of knowledge of such an act. Sub-section 3 says that the five-year limit does not apply to corruption arising out of misuse of government, community and public property. The five-year statute of limitations would have simply enabled corruption to take deeper roots.The bill was first registered in the National Assembly in January 2020. KP Oli was the Prime Minister back then. The Oli-led Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist-Leninist) and Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) allied to contest the 2017 general elections and dominated, winning 121 and 53 seats respectively in the 275-member House of Representatives. The two parties even merged in May 2018, but a Supreme Court ruling rendered the merger defunct in March 2021. The bill was registered in the National Assembly as they had a two-thirds majority, with the UML’s Ganesh Prasad Timilsina as the chairperson. The Upper House passed the bill in March 2023.No statute of limitations on corruptionThe bill is now at the House of Representatives. Again, Oli, the leader of the second-largest party with 79 seats, heads the government. After the UML withdrew support to his predecessor Dahal, whose party is the third-largest with 32 seats, Oli has been in power since mid-July this year. And, as luck would have it, with the backing from four other coalition partners, including the largest party with 88 seats, the Nepali Congress, Oli enjoys a two-thirds majority. Dev Raj Ghimire of the UML leads the House, while Ramchandra Poudel, a Nepali Congress veteran, is the President. Oli probably thought he would be able to ram the bill through. But opposition—among politicians, the media and the public—thankfully, was huge. Consequently, the government was forced to change the course of its half-baked plan to codify a five-year statute of limitations. But the fact that they had the audacity to even propose such an idiotic idea at all is a testament to the deteriorating political mentality in Nepal. Pervasive corruption in the top echelons of the government is no longer news. Be it a case of illegal grabbing of public lands or sending Nepalis as Bhutanese refugees for monetary benefit, the political elites are immersed in corrupt practices up to the gills. Last year, Transparency International’s Corruption Practices Index ranked Nepal 108th out of 180 countries and territories, giving it a slim score of 35 out of 100.A weakened justice system reduces accountability for public officials. If the proposed amendment had become law, this would have only increased impunity for corruption. Now that the Oli administration has clarified that it is no longer pursuing it, lawmakers should focus on a different act. Sub-section 2 of Section 13 of the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act, 1991 already limits the time for the CIAA to initiate prosecution to five years of corruption taking place. In essence, if someone commits corruption and manages—using some of the ill-gotten wealth—to suppress the crime for five years, he gets off scot-free. As unreal as this may sound, this is already the law.Blow the whistleIdeally, the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2002, and the Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act, 1991, should not conflict with each other, but that is precisely what they do regarding the statute of limitations on corruption. Ironically, the CIAA was formed as far back as February 1992—a couple of years after the civil unrest that led to the onset of a multiparty system in April 1990—with a noble goal of corruption control within the government. It is an autonomous constitutional body. Yet, it routinely takes the flak for only going after and successfully prosecuting the small fish, not the big ones. The aforementioned Sub-section 2 of Section 13 of the Act is a loophole and must be plugged. Prem Kumar Rai, former home secretary, is the current chief commissioner of the CIAA. The post is a political appointment, as is, let us say, ambassadorial. This is how it is practised in other countries as well. But the main difference here is that these positions—among others—are filled more on party quota and less on merit. The appointees thus feel obligated to be loyal to the party and/or the leader who appointed them. Oli appointed Rai in February 2021. Then, there is the unfortunate practice of ministers, and even the prime minister, making Cabinet-level decisions that are treated as above the law. This does nothing but help foster policy-level corruption, such as the one regarding Lalita Niwas.Oli, Dahal and Sher Bahadur Deuba, a five-time prime minister and Nepali Congress president, sing their own praises as to how they have actively fought corruption. Yet the public wonders how most politicians who entered Kathmandu wearing slippers are now worth millions. If these leaders are seriously committed to combating corruption, they can show it by strengthening the laws surrounding whistleblowers, who would step forward through a robust legal framework of protections and rewards. The public would earnestly appreciate it. Their level of frustration is so elevated that any political party that dares to take on corruption head-on is likely to get rewarded handsomely in the 2027 general elections.  \nIn the last decade, three political leaders have captured Nepal’s democracy and the state. They control the political parties, and through them, the whole nation. They have complete control over the affairs of the state; no high-level corruption is possible without their consent.Yet, in the last few months, new kinds of political competition, with deeper structural roots, are playing out. But the problems are so entrenched that changes to the status quo look difficult in the near term.The future of Nepalis will depend on how this conflict plays out, whether we will be able to solve our most persistent problems and reap the benefits of democracy.Political competitionThe first type of political competition—among the largest three parties—is the most banal, yet the most threatening. What looks like a game of musical chairs is aimed at shoring up the powers of three individuals and their factions. In the process, they have the potential to rig political systems in their favour so that changes to the status quo become more difficult.In the latest round of the game, Nepali Congress (NC) leader Sher Bahadur Deuba and Prime Minister KP Oli have forged an alliance, “kicking out” Pushpa Kamal Dahal from power. Both parties have shown a temporary commitment to fighting the next election on their own strength without forging a political alliance, and, maybe, avoiding another round of betrayal by Dahal. It is no surprise that Oli blamed Dahal for trying to “incite malcontents and create unrest.”On his part, Dahal is on a nationwide campaign, trying to shore up support. He has alleged the NC and the CPN-UML of trying to push back the country towards a two-party system, initiating regressive changes in the constitution, allowing more space to geopolitical pressures and dissuading anti-corruption initiatives. A Maoist Centre leader, Giriraj Mani Pokharel, claimed that Dahal’s anti-corruption initiative was the primary reason for his ouster.Behind the NC-UML nexus is another perceived threat: The rise of new parties, political figures and political movements. It seems as if the ruling coalition is intent on weakening the Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) and Mayor Balen Shah, who represent emerging aspirations for a new kind of political culture.As if the threat from “neophytes” was not enough, leaders of the three major parties are facing competition from within their parties.In the UML, as discontent and indiscipline grow, former President Bidya Devi Bhandari appears to be reorganising the party base, offering an alternative to PM Oli’s leadership. In the NC, young leaders like Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma are pushing for a paradigm shift in party organisation and leadership. Even within the MC, Dahal feels the threat from two different factions, forcing him to claim that he remains above the position of party president—given that he has been globally recognised as the leader of a political movement. He said he would one day hand over the party to a special team and play a different role, but that day has not come yet.Competition among and within political parties and political movements is visible. What remains invisible, yet has the potential to transform politics, is the shifting political psychology of the public. The rise of a new generation of citizens, who are dealigned with traditional parties, fed up with corruption, and want broad-based reforms in the economy, is not so simplistic. However, it has the potential to upend traditional politics and pose a direct threat to the interests of existing leaders.Entrenched problemsSince October 2015, only Dahal, Deuba and Oli have become prime ministers, playing seven rounds of musical chairs. Yet, they are the ones to complain the most about political instability. By the end of 2027, it would be 12 years since the promulgation of the constitution, and despite all the “instability,” only three would have shared the premiership eight times. Unfortunately, they will most likely be the ones to continue until 2032. This is a unique kind of political stability, although unwanted.Another undesired challenge is the role of geopolitical engagements in Nepal. On the one hand, geopolitical actors continue to play the traditional role of allies and “trusted friends.” However, a more controversial process is also taking place, that of elite control and resource capture. Despite claims to the contrary, senior party leaders accept that China and India have the leverage and means to influence political careers and party viability. So far, we’ve seen that both China and India have influence over major political parties, meaning that party polarisation towards either China or India has not been feasible. Geopolitics offers local political elites the opportunity to entrench themselves and capture more resources than those coming from outside. Pokhara International Airport is one example. This issue needs closer scrutiny.Political reforms and change in leadership are closely linked to corruption and kleptocracy.It is common knowledge among Nepal’s bureaucracy and experts that, in the last two decades, none of the major corruption cases would have been possible without the consent and willful inaction of the Council of Ministers. It is no secret that electoral politics is becoming extortionate and is driving corruption. So is party politics. Top leaders need an inordinate amount of money to maintain control over the party.In the last two decades, corruption in Nepal has become so systematised that it has led to an elaborate kleptocratic network. The network is patronised by influential political leaders and run by several key individual “brokers.” The kleptocratic network that pervades political parties, the bureaucracy and the judicial system, partners with the state machinery to steal from the ordinary people, consumers and the state. The kleptocracy has developed impunity to protect its members and ensure that resources continue to flow up.The kleptocratic system, most of the time, is undifferentiated with crony capitalism and policy corruption. Crony capitalism is especially prevalent in procurements, natural resources, finance, health and education sectors. Given the robust but hidden linkages between politics and business, this will continue in the near future. As long as crony capitalism remains strong, a fair and competitive market will remain a mirage for the younger generation of professional entrepreneurs and expatriate well wishers.ConclusionSadly, the current political course is unlikely to change soon. A lot of energy and political power is needed to dismantle kleptocracy, enact critical reforms in the electoral and political systems, and transition to a fair, competitive and broad-based market system.As long as political elites control the state and the prospect of political and economic reforms, changes will not be possible without their consent. The only way out is either to wrest off their power or align their interests with potential reforms.In this context, growing discontent among the people and emerging political competition have the potential to widen the space for changemaking.It’s time to recognise that, maybe, we need disruption. We’ve had too much stability, of the unwanted kind. \nFor most of human history, human rights did not exist. The struggle to secure them arguably began in 1215 with the Magna Carta in England, which promised protection from illegal imprisonment as a right. But it took another 733 years and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights for those rights to be enshrined for all.Now, just 76 years later, they’re at risk of being lost.Amid an ongoing and very public massacre in Gaza, to which the countries of the West remain mute spectators or enablers, the moral distinction between the liberal democracies of the West and the illiberal democracies and dictatorships among the rest is disappearing.An estimated 40,000 Palestinians, many of them babies, children and women, have been killed in the Israeli massacre in Gaza, which began after a terror attack by Hamas that killed 1,478 Israelis, most of them civilians. The victims of Israel’s attacks include 113 journalists and 224 humanitarian aid workers, of whom 179 were employees of the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees. There are also credible accusations of sexual crimes by Israeli forces.The Western and especially the American response to all this, ranging from silent nods to standing ovations for the Israelis, may enable other governments around the world to justify all manner of human rights violations in the name of national security.The rise and fallThe fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989 and the subsequent collapse of totalitarian regimes across Eastern Europe and in the former Soviet Union ushered in a new era of freedoms, rights and democracy in those parts of the world.The United Nations organised a series of world conferences in the post-Cold War period, starting with the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio, the 1993 World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, the 1995 World Conference on Women in Beijing, and the 1995 World Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen. Governments and non-governmental organisations were mobilised for these conferences, and the world saw an unprecedented growth of non-profit organisations, including many that worked in the area of human rights.In some nations ruled by autocrats who sought to suppress non-government organisations, especially human rights organisations, assistance from the West was their lifeline. Western liberal democracies stood as the moral vanguard, often critiquing the crackdown, and their media amplified this.The September 11, 2001 attacks in New York by Al-Qaeda changed that.The US’s PATRIOT Act encouraged other countries to adopt similar anti-terror legislation. The targeting of human rights organisations and activists under anti-terror laws began soon after and became a worldwide phenomenon.By 2012, India had made “dissent” including causing or intending to cause disaffection against India, a terror offence under its anti-terror law, the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The law was amended in 2019 to enable individuals to be designated as terrorists without due process. Consequently, in 2024, Booker Prize-winning author Arundhati Roy became one of the accused under this law for an alleged speech about Jammu and Kashmir in 2010.The most significant negative impact on human rights groups worldwide from the September 11 attacks arose from the expansion of the mandate of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF), initially established in 1989 by the G7 to develop policies to combat money laundering. It expanded its mandate to include “terrorism financing” in 2001. The FATF issued several guidelines to ensure no terror financing by non-profit organisations (NPOs). Governments around the world have since used this as a tool to throttle funding to NPOs.In 2010, India was found non-compliant by the FATF’s Mutual Evaluation Report on NPOs, clearly stating that “India has not demonstrated that measures are in place to sanction violations of oversight measures or rules by NPOs or persons acting on behalf of NPOs for NPOs other than those registered under the Income Tax Act and under the FCRA”. The report suggested India amend its laws on non-profits.India subsequently amended the Foreign Contribution Regulation Act, 2010 (FCRA) in 2020 to further restrict the inflow and use of foreign funds. In the last decade, FCRA licences of more than 20,693 NGOs have been cancelled. The most prominent human rights organisation in the world, Amnesty International, faces charges of money laundering in India and was forced to halt operations there in 2020 after its bank accounts were frozen.The FATF evaluation published in June 2024 was cited by the Indian government for repeated extensions of the tenure of the Chief of Enforcement Directorate S.K. Mishra, a favoured bureaucrat of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Enforcement Directorate is the strong arm of the government responsible for cases against numerous opposition politicians and the first-ever arrest of an incumbent chief minister, Delhi’s Arvind Kejriwal.India is not alone. Across the world, the FATF recommendations have been used to effectively close down non-profit organisations.Economics and nationalismThe rise of China and India intensified an already existing debate about development assistance in the West. Then, the 2007-08 financial crisis happened.After that, state and private donors simply did not have adequate funds to share, and development assistance came under stress and scrutiny in the West. The COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further dried up resources. For human rights organisations in the global south, which were largely sustained by financial assistance from Western countries, the combination of state repression and fund crunch have been fatal.As right-wing nationalism has taken centre stage in country after country, from India to Brazil and Hungary to the US in the last decade, authorities have taken measures to block foreign funding to NGOs to prevent “foreign interference”. The issue for governments is sovereignty and national security. As we are witnessing with Gaza, there are no limits to what can be justified through such arguments.The effective ban on foreign funding and the Soros Foundation in 2018 by Viktor Orbán of Hungary, a recipient of the Soros Foundation’s scholarship to study at Oxford, epitomised the backlash against rights and democracy issues in the West. The European Union stood by as a mute witness as Orbán made Soros the scapegoat of the far right.Governments copy one another in their rhetoric and tools of repression.Russia’s Foreign Agent Law of 2012, which requires anyone who receives support from outside Russia to declare themselves as foreign agents, is being replicated in Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Slovakia and Hungary, just the way India’s FCRA law was replicated in Bangladesh which established an NGO Affairs Bureau to control foreign funding. However, it is not in Russia but in the West that one can find older laws that arguably set the template.The United States has had a Foreign Agents Registration Act since 1938 that requires public disclosures from “agents of foreign principals engaged in political activities”, although the law is not evenly applied.The United Kingdom is leading the way in setting a template for targeting environmental defenders. In July 2024, five environmental activists were charged with conspiracy to cause a public nuisance for organising direct action protests that caused gridlock on London’s orbital motorway in November 2022. They face long sentences after being found guilty. If history is any guide, this action of the United Kingdom will soon reverberate in its former colonies and the world.Chakma is the Asia Campaign Manager for the IPLP Initiative on Indigenous Peoples and Director, Rights & Risks Analysis Group.-360info \nHe never lets slip a chance to pontificate on religion, culture, nationalism and whatnot. During the Covid-19 pandemic, he advised dubious home remedies such as besar paani (turmeric water) and suggested sneezing would blow out the dreaded virus from the body. He has his own take on gaidas (rhinos) being unique to Nepal, Ayodhya being in Thori, Parsa, and yoga originating in Nepal. Yet, in a National Youth Conclave last month, he for once expressed his ignorance of something: the LGBTQIA+ community. His statement in a video which went viral—“I don’t know much about the issue”—when asked how his government would support the community, comes as a setback for the progressive image the country has cultivated in the process of ensuring the rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals. To say “I don’t know” is human, but certainly not for KP Sharma Oli, Nepal’s Prime Minister, and not on such a vital issue.Nepal gained international accolades for registering the first same-sex marriage last year. It has taken a step forward with the concept of “inclusive tourism”, which aims to ensure a safe destination for the LGBTQIA+ community. The country’s constitution and policies for the queer community and minorities are regarded as the most inclusive in South Asia. Despite this, queer people continue to struggle to find their place in a society that values the male-female binary. Queer rights activists admit that even though there has been some legal progress, much remains to be done, for instance in relation to the community’s citizenship rights. Even with progressive laws, identifying someone as an LGBTQIA+ individual isn’t easy because of the inherent bias against them. This is partly because political leaders with people’s mandate don’t heed them or discuss their issues.Such a display of bias and ignorance from the government head signals a broader problem of political disengagement from minority concerns. The low standing of female politicians in the eyes of their better-ranking male counterparts keeps women from participating in vital decision-making. Oli’s chauvinistic mindset displayed in his recent prejudiced remarks against Sumana Shrestha’s leadership and her political legitimacy is also manifest in the shape of his cabinet that has only two women. Nor does Oli’s cabinet have a single Dalit. The inclusion of queer community in Nepali decision-making organs is a still more distant dream.Political rhetoric has real consequences. As a recent Post report highlights, after Oli’s statement, many queer community members have faced bullying from friends and families alike. For real progress to happen, Nepal’s leaders must make more of an effort to understand the issues and concerns of people from all communities and walks of life. As vital is sensitising both leaders and the public, who often applaud such harmful remarks. As Oli himself admitted after the expression of his ignorance of the queer community, every individual, regardless of gender, should get equal rights. These rights should include the right to live your life the way you want to, and for that way of life to be recognised by the state and society you call home. It is also incumbent on our leaders to better familiarise themselves with LGBTQIA+ policies so that they are not out of step with their younger and more progressive electorate and with the rest of the world.  \nThe two biggest parties of the country, which are also in a ruling coalition, have committed to fighting upcoming elections on their own. In fact, the CPN (Maoist Centre), the main opposition, has made the same commitment. This is great news. It is about time the real strength of these parties was tested. Yet there is room to doubt their public stand. Nepal’s current electoral system makes it impossible for any one party to get an absolute majority and there is no alternative to forging an alliance to run the country. So the political parties are tempted to strike pre-election alliances. The Nepali parties are not confident of their popularity: The established ones can no longer count on their traditional vote-banks; nor are the newer outfits assured of their own vote-mobilisation skills. Thus whatever political parties big and small say now, they are likely to seek pre-election alliances for the 2027 vote.Perhaps by design, the commitments of the big parties are also not unanimous. The just-concluded Nepali Congress central working committee passed a resolution to “stand on our own in upcoming elections and ensure that our electorate gets to cast their vote for ‘tree’ [the Congress election symbol].” Yet leaders of the establishment faction under Sher Bahadur Deuba insist that the resolution does not rule out pre-poll alliances. They say such ‘strategic issues’ cannot be settled years ahead of elections. On Tuesday, UML chair KP Sharma Oli also clarified that even though his party is currently in an alliance with the Congress, the UML would fight the next elections on its own. Yet many party leaders are not convinced. The current alliance with the Congress, which could continue till election-time, will make it difficult for the UML to mount a strong attack against its main electoral competitor. Their electoral pitch already muddled, what will be the harm in having an electoral alliance, some UML leaders are asking?The bitter 2021 UML-Maoist Centre divorce aside, there is still a sizable constituency in the UML in favour of a broad left alliance (culminating in an eventual left unity). This constituency is sure to clamour for a communist alliance ahead of the next polls. The Maoist Centre, which has already been reduced to a rump of a political force that had emerged in the 2008 Constituent Assembly election, will also be desperate for a pre-poll alliance just to ensure its existence. The problem, again, is this lopsided calculation of political parties, which reduces electoral contests to a pure numbers game. Ideology and vision are at the heart of competitive politics and without them no political party can stay relevant for long. Pre-poll alliances confuse the electorate about individual parties’ guiding principles and beliefs. Just because pre-poll alliances are convenient for political parties does not make them right. If Nepali political parties were committed to democratic values and if they had a long-term vision, they would not be afraid to play a constructive role in governance and service delivery from the opposition’s bench. Yet as Pushpa Kamal Dahal’s restlessness in the opposition no sooner than he was ousted as prime minister, shows, for Nepali top leaders, getting to power and staying there is everything. Not for them the ground-up task of building the party organisation and steadily gaining public legitimacy and recognition based on their own ideals and values.     \nThe recent case of the disappearance of Mamta Kafle Bhatt, a registered nurse at the UVA Health Prince William Medical Center in Virginia, United States, has distressed Nepalis all over the globe. She was first reported missing on August 2 when police visited her home in Manassas city, where she lived with her husband, Naresh Bhatt and her year-old daughter. What seemed like an act of disappearance seemingly turned into a convoluted case of murder when the husband, a former Fairfax County police recruit and ex-US Army Reserve, was accused of killing her after the detectives searched their home on August 21. Nepalis who knew Mamta and her well-wishers from the community were in shock. If the accusations are true, this would be another sad and shameful case of the killing of a Nepali woman by her partner after being subjected to Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). It forces us to reflect on the hidden problem of violence against women in intimate relationships in Nepal. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), IPV is a common form of violence against women and includes physical, sexual and emotional abuse and controlling behaviours by an intimate partner. The National Demographic Health Survey 2022 revealed that 27 percent of women in Nepal had experienced IPV in their lifetime. Further, the registered cases of domestic violence in Nepal have noticeably increased in the past 28 years.Many Nepali women feel unseen, unheard and powerless in their relationship with men. Moreover, there is a general lack of understanding of consent among Nepali men. During the Covid-19 pandemic, violence between intimate partners increased worldwide. In Nepal, police reported that cases of violence against women steadily rose despite the country being under prohibitory orders. The ingrained patriarchy manifests in various forms in intimate relationships where women suffer and become scarred for life. Marital rape is also widespread, with loopholes in the implementation of related laws.Internalising the lack of safety at home, many Nepali women dream of going abroad and settling there. But, sadly, patriarchy leading to IPV goes beyond borders. This year alone, there have been cases of Nepali women being killed abroad. On August 29, Muna Pandey, a Nepali student, was shot dead in her apartment in Houston, Texas. Police arrested 51-year-old Bobby Singh, who was known to frequent the restaurant where Pandey worked. Earlier this year, Chandra Maya Poudel-Rimal was murdered by her husband, James Rimal, in Ohio during an argument. In the same state, in July, Tika Dhimal was murdered by her husband, Sada Dhimal, who later committed suicide.These instances suggest Nepali women are vulnerable to IPV everywhere. In many cases, women give their partners several chances before speaking up. Even if they decide to seek legal help, they usually settle the matter, facing pressure from family or their partners. A former colleague reportedly knew of Mamta’s domestic violence situation with her husband. When her colleague told Mamta to leave her house and offered help, Mamta decided to give her husband another chance. Although Nepal has made progress through stronger laws against the violation of women’s rights and participation in the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, they are still not enough to ensure women’s safety from IPV. There is an urgent need to foster awareness to empower women to seek help and assert their rights. Finally, we must teach our men the basics of consent in relationships. Legal mechanisms can only do so much if we as a society fail to challenge and change our patriarchal mindset. \nNepal has often earned global recognition for its progressive policies and inclusive stance on LGBTQIA+ rights. But do the global accolades Nepal has earned in terms of its progressiveness reflect the actual experiences of queer people here? The Post’s Aarati Ray sat down with Manisha Dhakal, executive director of the Blue Diamond Society and a leading advocate for LGBTQIA+ rights in South Asia for over 23 years.Nepal is often hailed for its progressive stance on queer rights, both in South Asia and globally. With over two decades of queer rights advocacy, how accurate do you find this portrayal?Many activists and commentators do describe Nepal as being progressive on queer rights. While this is partly true, especially when we consider the legal frameworks, the reality at the grassroots is quite different. On the one hand, Nepal’s constitution recognises LGBTQIA+ identities. Articles 12 and 18 mandate that “gender identity” be acknowledged on citizenship certificates, while Article 42 promises affirmative action and participation in government for sexual and gender minorities. Court decisions in Nepal, too, have been favourable for LGBTQIA+ rights, and unlike many former British colonies with Section 377-type laws that criminalise queer communities, Nepal has no such legal barriers. So, indeed, there are opportunities for activism, and progress has been made, particularly in terms of legal recognition. But, again, the rights enshrined in the constitution and affirmed by the courts have not been realised at the grassroots level. We are stuck with a limited focus, primarily on citizenship. The state claims that we’ve been given the right to identity and legal recognition, but even this is not fully realised. For example, the process of obtaining citizenship based on self-identification remains difficult, with government officials still unclear on how to implement these provisions. The broader narrative of Nepal being progressive is built on a superficial understanding of the situation.In August, Nepal’s Supreme Court ruled that Rukshana Kapali, a transgender woman, should be legally recognised as a woman on all documents without medical verification. How does this decision impact the future of LGBTQIA+ rights in Nepal?Rukshana’s case is a prominent victory, highlighting the judiciary’s support for LGBTQIA+ rights, especially compared to those of the executive and legislative branches. This ruling lays a strong foundation for similar future cases and will undoubtedly help in future activism. However, it’s important to note that the decision applies only to Kapali, meaning others will still need to go through the courts to have their gender identity legally recognised. How long must transgender individuals continue to endure lengthy court processes just to obtain citizenship?Even outside the courts, the bureaucratic hurdles—from medical reassignment surgeries to invasive checkups and long delays from the CDO (District Administration Office) to the Ministry of Home Affairs—can take years, with no guarantee of getting preferred names on legal documents. In many cases, even after completing the process, the names are inaccurately changed, such as altering Ram to Rama instead of the preferred name, like Manisha.We [Blue Diamond Society] get 15-20 complaints each year, primarily from transgender women, regarding difficulties in obtaining citizenship.The Supreme Court’s recent decision on same-sex marriage in Nepal has attracted global attention and gotten a positive response. Are there any limits to the court’s decision?After a long and arduous process, we secured temporary registration for same-sex marriages. On June 28, 2023, the Supreme Court, in the Pinky Gurung vs. Government of Nepal case, issued an interim order instructing the government to temporarily register same-sex marriages, including for those with “other” gender markers. That said, the Civil Code adopted in 2017 still defines marriage as a union between a ‘man’ and a ‘woman’.We, as a community, are pleased with the government’s temporary registration process. Yet it falls short of offering full marriage rights, including those related to property, adoption, and tax exemptions. While the court’s decision sets a supportive precedent, lack of clarity about the rights associated with the temporary certificate leaves many in limbo. So far, only around five couples have registered, and many in the community are hesitant to do so.The question remains: Can this temporary registration truly grant us the same recognition as heterosexual marriages? While the decision has garnered global praise, the LGBTQIA+ community on the ground continues to feel cheated of true equality. Our ultimate goal is to amend the Civil Code so that marriage is defined as a union between two individuals, rather than being restricted to one between male and female.Why do many court decisions on queer rights in Nepal, like of same-sex marriages, remain in limbo? Is this due to the government and courts trying to appease both conservative and progressive groups, or is it just a performative gesture of inclusivity?There are multiple factors at play. I think some responsibility also falls on activists. For example, when fighting for legal recognition since 2008, we should have advocated not only for the “third gender” or “other” but also for individuals who have transitioned from male to female or female to male. What’s more, policymakers and bureaucrats still lack awareness about human rights principles related to minority groups like the LGBTQIA+ community. Even though Nepal has ratified international conventions on human rights, these commitments have not been prioritised by lawmakers, which leads to this state of limbo and half-hearted inclusivity.As for the internal thought processes of bureaucrats and lawmakers, it’s hard to say. Many of them might still believe that the LGBTQIA+ community shouldn’t be granted full rights, so they engage in performative actions—appearing supportive on the surface to attract global attention but hesitating to fully advance our rights. This could explain why progress seems to stall midway.Queer rights have received some legal recognition. But how are they reflected in terms of social and cultural acceptance in Nepal?Legal changes and social acceptance need to go hand in hand. If we only focus on legal reforms without addressing societal attitudes, there will be no real change. We’ve seen this play out—there is legal recognition of gender identity, and temporary registration for same-sex marriage is available. Yet people struggle to fully realise these rights because of deep-rooted discrimination within families and society.In Nepal, a socially and culturally driven society, where family, relatives, and festivals play a major role, social acceptance is often more important than legal acceptance. When it comes to cultural acceptance, biases still persist. For example, it feels like we’re allowed to express ourselves openly only during the Pride Month in June. When we try to participate in other celebrations like Teej or Gaijatra, society often reacts negatively, asking why we need to “spoil” their festivals. This shows that social change is still lagging, despite the progress in legal rights.You mentioned that the queer community is often given the surface level of legal recognition. How is the state of the exercise of fundamental rights for LGBTQIA+ people in Nepal?Labelled as ‘gender and sexual minorities’, our broader struggles are ignored. When we raise concerns about poverty, food insecurity, or unemployment, the response we often get from government institutions and stakeholders is, “This isn’t our issue; it’s a gender problem.”We are just as much a part of society as anyone else. Issues like climate change, housing, and poverty affect us too. We want to be included in solutions, whether it’s participating in climate programs or being involved in community initiatives. Unfortunately, lawmakers and stakeholders often overlook that we are just as human as heterosexuals, with needs that go beyond legal recognition on paper.What are some aspects of the queer community that have not received enough attention in media narratives, and what tends to be unnecessarily highlighted?As I’ve mentioned before, the narrative surrounding our community often focuses heavily on issues like citizenship, while overlooking other important aspects of our lives. What’s missing is the correct representation of our contributions in various fields. Many LGBTQIA+ individuals are doctors, and experts in different professions, yet their accomplishments are only rarely acknowledged or represented. Instead, the focus often falls on the unfortunate image of some members of the community begging on the streets, which goes viral on social media.Another issue is the way we are predominantly associated with sex and sexuality. While these are important aspects of human identity, we are much more than that. We have other needs and rights that deserve attention. Unfortunately, the media tends to fixate on sexual aspects of the LGBTQIA+ community, reinforcing stereotypes. It’s time for the media to move beyond this narrow portrayal and include us in broader discussions that reflect the full scope of our lives.How has the current narrative of progressiveness in Nepal impacted real change for the LGBTQIA+ community?It’s time to move beyond this narrative of progressiveness. True progress should lead to further development, not be a barrier to it. Unfortunately, the current narrative seems to be stagnating.For instance, when we raise issues with the government, the response often is, “We’ve already given you the right to citizenship. You’re getting citizenship now.” Even when I travel people sometimes ask, “You’ve got citizenship, right? Things are becoming progressive.” This narrative of progressiveness has become an excuse for the government to claim they’ve done enough and to avoid further action.This surface-level progressiveness is used to showcase Nepal as forward-thinking internationally, but it hasn’t translated into real change for people at the grassroots. It also impedes activists’ efforts by providing the government with a shield against criticism. Until this narrative of progressiveness evolves into genuine, accountable action that goes beyond court decisions and performative gestures, it will continue to be a barrier to actual progress. \nThe Federal Parliament last month passed the bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act. Political parties displayed exemplary unity in the course of endorsing the bill, which was promptly welcomed by the international community. If this undertaking succeeds, the remaining tasks of Nepal’s nearly two-decade-long peace process will be completed. In this context, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal and Binod Ghimire sat down with constitutional expert and former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who has over the years been closely involved in Nepal’s transitional justice process.As a legal expert, how do you see the latest amendment in the transitional justice Act?Looking at it from a legal perspective, the Supreme Court’s order given in this context is the major basis. The amendment has complied with over 95 percent of the top court’s directives. There is one more context we can refer to. The government in 2018 had prepared a ‘zero draft’ on this issue. The international community had expressed their reservations on certain provisions. Most of the contents of that draft have been retained while addressing those reservations. There are some major improvements. The amendment has taken a more liberal approach to victims’ rights. For instance, the draft had only said that the victims would be consulted for reconciliation but the latest amendment made victims’ consent mandatory. If a victim doesn’t want to give consent, he or she can go to court. This is a major change. Likewise, the draft had said the verdict of the to-be-formed Special Court [with a mandate to hear and decide the transitional justice related cases] would be final. But the amendment has allowed the dissatisfied side to appeal in the Supreme Court. There is a plan for a separate fund to carry out transitional justice related tasks so as to ensure fiscal autonomy for the two transitional justice commissions. This process needs fiscal as well as administrative autonomy. You just mentioned that the new Act has complied with 95 percent of the top court’s directives. Could you elaborate on the remaining five percent?I meant to say that the amendment is closer to the court’s directives. I can’t say it is 100 percent because even they [the Supreme Court justices] at the time said ‘so and so’ should be done on a hypothetical ground as so many things were still evolving. Now, some issues might have become redundant. But most of the things have been addressed. See, first, we should have conceptual clarity. There is a fundamental difference between retributive justice and transitional justice systems. In retributive justice, cases are decided by regular courts based on existing laws while in the transitional justice system we have to look into political, social as well as cultural aspects. This is the internationally accepted approach.The amendment has included a provision of up to 75 percent reduced sentencing. The attorney general, who works for the government, is mandated to recommend this. Isn’t this akin to directing the court? Wouldn’t it instead be prudent to leave that to the court? If that were not done, there would be mistrust and the process may not have gotten sufficient support from the warring sides of the past. In such a scenario, the process may have again failed. A supportive role of the stakeholders will be crucial. Of late, I often urge the victims to cooperate with the process; otherwise it will remain a never-ending process. It’s already too late. So, now we should be pragmatic. We should carry out things on a priority basis. Finding and respecting truth are the first and second priorities. The option to go to court is there, if someone wants so. The fourth priority is reparation. The goal is to establish that no one will need to take up arms and resort to violence in Nepal again. Now, most of the stakeholders are positive about concluding this process. The international community has in fact asked us what type of support we need.It is said the role of Desmond Tutu, who led the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of South Africa, was crucial for the success of the country’s transitional justice process. Do you think the personality of the heads of the commissions will be vital in our case as well?Leadership definitely matters. In Colombia as well, a person of similar stature, who is respected by all sides in the country, led the process. So, the leadership and composition of the commissions will matter. The commissions should be allowed to work and make decisions on their own.There are nearly 64,000 complaints with the TRC and around 2,400 with the CIEDP. How should the commissions carry out their task? Will they deal with each and every case individually? What are international practices and what is a broader conceptual understanding in our case?It is too early to talk about the working modality but I believe most cases should be dealt with in a representative way. But cases of serious rights violations will enter the prosecution stage. Producing sufficient evidence to prove the crimes, however, will be challenging. For instance, some rape victims may not be able to name the perpetrators. They were raped but couldn’t even recognise the perpetrator. In such a case, the state should respect such victims and provide reparation to them. Some complainants may choose not to continue with the cases. Before determining whether certain cases are serious or not, each file has to be checked at least once. So, the commissions need a large number of investigating officers. Field offices need to be set up based on the number and nature of complaints. What kind of involvement of international agencies may be needed for this process?It will certainly need the involvement of international agencies. Nepal’s peace process is basically home-grown but we will also seek support and expertise from international agencies, as we did in the past. We never work in isolation but the areas where we need their support will be decided only after the commissions start their work. We need international experts for certain specialised tasks, such as conducting DNA tests and exhuming bodies buried during the insurgency. The way the international community promptly welcomed the new amendment, it seems that the government and political parties were working in close consultation with them. Is that so?As far as I am informed, everything was done by Nepalis. But there was communication with the international agencies. They had earlier expressed their concerns on the ‘zero draft’ and the issues have been addressed. Therefore, they promptly welcomed it. They obviously are involved indirectly because it is a matter the international community is closely watching. But now we may need their direct support to carry out certain specialised tasks.Why didn’t the amendment even mention the use of child soldiers, crime against humanity and war crime?It is a matter of serious consideration as to whether our cases fall under the definition of serious crimes such as crime against humanity. The commissions will study this aspect as well.Don’t you think the provision of reduced sentencing and overlooking of certain legal aspects may promote impunity?Even now, inmates get a waiver of around 50 percent under the regular legal system. So the provision to reduce sentences is already there.But such sentences are reduced only after serving for a certain time and demonstrating good behaviour. Shouldn’t we have adopted a similar approach in this case?Transitional justice system should be seen a bit differently. Here, I give you an example. In Colombia, the TRC of the country summoned the seven secretariat members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). They were first briefed about the charges registered against them. They admitted that they committed the crimes. Then, all of them were acquitted because they spoke the truth. The TRC in Colombia gave priority to finding the truth. If someone showed honesty and cooperated in finding the truth they wouldn’t be punished. But they increased the penalty for those who tried to mislead them through falsehood.Can we say our process is a bit driven by a reparative approach?I again stress that we should look at the transitional justice process differently than how we look at the retributive justice system. It needs a different law, different court and a different jurisprudence.It takes years of rigorous work to complete this process and firm commitment of major political forces is vital. Frequent changes in coalition and unpredictable relations between the political forces is our reality. Don’t you think such instability may hamper this process?This time around, the role of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli is very positive. Chiefs of the three biggest parties, while addressing a parliament meeting, have expressed their commitment to make this process successful. Their unity on this matter is important. Not only them, all the political parties represented in the federal parliament, except one lawmaker from a fringe party, have supported this amendment. It has thus become a national issue. I hope this consensus will remain intact while picking officials for the commissions and taking the entire process to a logical end.Given your expertise and involvement in this process, you are being seen as a strong candidate for the TRC chair. What is the reality?I have nothing to say as no one has talked to me about this. \nLately, road accidents are taking place almost every day. Thousands of people lose their lives in road crashes every year across the country. What are the factors causing these disasters? Why have the authorities failed to prevent them? The Post's Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former secretary Arjun Jung Thapa, who was director general at the Department of Roads for years, to discuss the pressing issue.Why are road accidents taking place so frequently in Nepal? There is no one reason for road accidents. On the infrastructure front, factors like design, condition and geometry of a road are crucial. Putting sign boards along the roads and giving vital information about the particular location is necessary. Those signs should be placed properly so all driving vehicles and passengers can see them clearly. Some technical aspects, such as whether the superelevation is properly designed, particularly at sharp bends, matter greatly. These must be regularly monitored and corrected in time. Regular vehicle fitness tests are essential. Experienced and disciplined drivers are equally important to ensure road safety. Some accidents occur when drivers are unfamiliar with the roads. For instance, the accident that took place at Anbukhaireni of Tanahun district on Friday, killing 27 Indian nationals, might have been because of the driver’s lack of familiarity with the road condition. Yet another serious concern is the lack of road discipline. Those who come to Nepal with years-long experience of driving abroad fear driving because of motorists' reckless driving and lack of lane discipline. The recent accident at Jadibuti, killing one scooter rider, could have been avoided if proper lane discipline had been followed. Reckless driving by motorcyclists has remained a big problem in our case. So, a separate lane should be designated for bikers. Similarly, lanes should be designated for vehicles based on their speed. But such rules are never followed seriously in our case. Traffic police have been entrusted with enforcing traffic rules but lack the human resources to enforce them effectively. We need an integrated and centrally controlled digital traffic light management system. We had experimented with a system as a trial for some time after 2015. We called a bid but couldn’t accept anyone as the bidders proposed more than the rate we had fixed. The project collapsed, and that system could never be revived. We badly lack technology in this sector. When we try to import technology, brokers get involved and ruin the entire process. The condition of roads built haphazardly, mainly in the hills, is another major concern. What do you say about that?We have built around 80,000 kilometres of road across the country. Of that, only around 14,000 kilometres fall under the jurisdiction of the road department. The rest of the road sections fall under the jurisdiction of various authorities, such as the Department of Local Infrastructure and provincial and local governments. The busiest roads are those under the Department of Roads. They are highways and regional roads. Only 50 percent of the roads overseen by the Department of Roads are blacktopped and are not maintained properly. Of the remaining 65,000 kilometres of road, only 4,000 kilometres are blacktopped. This means that the road condition across the country is poor and must be upgraded. The government will now develop the Kakarvitta-Gorusinghe section of the East-West Highway as a safe demonstration corridor. There will be proper infrastructure for crossings, grade-separated intersections, controlled entries, fencing for the safety from wild animals and crossings for wildlife. Local vehicles will run on service lanes. If it is developed as planned, it would be on par with Asian standards. Other roads in the pipeline will follow these standards. These criteria are being implemented while upgrading the Nagdhunga-Mugling road section as well. We have miles to go to upgrade our roads to international standards. Why are we failing to make quality roads?We can’t build our roads according to the original design. At times, locals obstruct road construction and force us to change the alignments. Then, we have to build them based on the availability of the land.Are our rural roads fit from the engineering perspective?Around 35,000 kilometers out of the 65,000 kilometers of roads that don’t fall under the jurisdiction of the Department of Roads are built randomly. Local leaders, influential individuals, and bulldozer operators fix the alignments of such roads.How can we rectify the malpractices in this sector?We need to activate the National Road Safety Council urgently. Officials from all the concerned departments and representatives from various stakeholders should sit together in this body and find solutions. Also, coordination has become more complicated in the federal system. For instance, highways are under federal jurisdiction, transport management on highways falls under provincial authority, while road management is under federal jurisdiction. Therefore, an effective coordinating body has become a must. Otherwise, we can’t control the increasing trend of deaths in road accidents. At least 1,700 people lost their lives in 2013, and the then government set a target to reduce it by at least 50 percent by 2020. Instead, the yearly death toll has crossed 2,800 now.While it takes years to complete road upgrading tasks, construction materials are left unmanaged and scattered, making driving along the road very difficult and dangerous. Can’t such things be improved?Contractors are powerful because of their political connection with influential leaders including prime ministers and ministers. Civil servants can’t be assertive when the contractors get political protection. At times, they try to use force to coerce government officials. If the situation is not going in their favour, they provoke locals with a plan to get extension in their contract citing local unrest. Experts say that the government is also to blame as it doesn’t carry out development projects properly. Do you agree?I worked for three decades in government agencies until a few months ago. What I found is that one government devises specific policies, plans and initiates certain projects but successive governments stop them. The new leadership starts its own plans and projects. Then, the contractors don’t get their payment. This is the other side of the story. Another problem is that our ministers, lawmakers and leaders show interest in the projects that deserve the least priority while important projects don’t get attention. For instance, around 30 kilometers of Arniko Highway, which connects Nepal with China, has been badly damaged. This is a very important road for the country. Can’t the government repair and maintain a 30-kilometer section of a highway? It requires just around Rs3 billion whereas leaders have allocated over Rs11.5 billion in the projects of personal interests of leaders. Around Rs4 billion has been allocated under lawmakers’ constituency development programmes and additional Rs5 billion has been earmarked for local bridges. We have allocated around Rs60 billion for non-important projects but we have ignored a crucial road, Arniko Highway, which was built with the support of our neighbour China in the 1960s. Thus we have given unnecessary importance where it doesn’t deserve while ignoring vital development projects. The road accidents are directly or indirectly linked to the government’s wrong policies and plans.Development projects are sometimes said to have failed due to rivalry between some leaders. Do you have any such experience?I will give you an example. In the Biratnagar-Bathnaha cross-border rail project, we had to build over 13 kilometers of the railway. It was around four to five years ago. We cleared over 11 kilometers but locals protested in the remaining section where a station was planned. The locals obstructed work there even as 85 percent of the money for land acquisition had already been distributed. Later, we found that the then minister Aman Lal Modi had provoked the locals to demand for additional money. He demanded a ‘special rate for his men’. But the laws don’t allow it.Some experts argue that to upgrade the quality of our roads, we need to make this sector competitive and, for that, we have to allow the private sector to develop projects. Is it viable?The government is hindering the private sector from entering into this business. They don’t invest without assured returns. They need roads like Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway. The government called for proposals in the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model for this project. They were interested. But the government simultaneously allowed a company to build the Kathmandu-Tunnel Road in the same area. Then the investors felt a risk to invest there. But, the company couldn’t continue the tunnel project. Private sector should be welcomed in this sector but we should create a conducive environment for that. Bangladesh and India have built infrastructure projects under the BOT model. We can do it as well.What do you think about the jurisdictional dispute over the New Road stretch between the Kathmandu Metropolis and the Department of Roads? Who should maintain this road?All the roads within the metropolis fall under the local government’s jurisdiction, as the constitution clearly states. The federal department is managing the roads with the understanding that the local governments are not efficient at maintaining them for now. If a local unit wants to maintain a certain road section on its own, the department should allow it without any dispute. Both sides showed childish behaviour while handling the New Road case. \nCPN (Unified Socialist) leader Ram Kumari Jhakri was among the most active leaders involved in the formation of the party after split with the CPN-UML in 2021. Three years on, she is now the most vocal leader calling for a unification of the two parties. Why didn’t the new party perform well, and what made her lobby for a party merger? Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat with former minister Jhakri for more insights.You worked actively to form the CPN (Unified Socialist), but the party couldn’t perform well. It couldn’t even become a national party from the general elections. What went wrong?We formed the CPN (Unified Socialist) out of compulsion. When Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli—who was prime minister at the time as well—dissolved the House of Representatives in December 2020, we firmly stood against his move, saying that it sowed the seeds of political instability. We staged huge protests and moved the Supreme Court against the decision of Oli, our party chair at the time. I was among the petitioners. Once the top court reinstated the House, we expected the party to move smoothly. Unfortunately, that couldn’t happen. The party establishment led by Oli and the rival faction took extreme actions against each other. The agitating faction announced action against the party chair, and the party establishment expelled us from the party itself. When Oli dissolved the House a second time, we protested the move as it brought instability. We were in favour of transforming the party through intra-party struggle, but the situation took some unexpected turns. We didn’t quit the party with a lofty plan of making a new revolutionary organisation. We were compelled to do so.Our new party accommodated many genuine leaders who had been sidelined in the UML. But ultimately, old leaders heavily dominated the new party’s central committee. They were active leaders of their time but were out of touch with the new, changing context. Young leaders didn’t get space in party committees. I proposed recruiting at least 40 percent members under 40 years in the central committee and over 50 percent members under 30 years in the district committees. I made a 29-year-old leader the chair of the district committee in my home district. In 42 days, I attended 36 district conventions where youths in their 30s were elected district committee chairs. I tried to reach out to municipalities to promote youths in the party chapters. But at the central level, old faces dominated party committees. That didn’t attract people to the party or impress the general public. Thus, it failed to gather steam right from the beginning.Many think that Madhav Kumar Nepal’s selection as party chief was a wrong move since he had led the UML for 15 years and become prime minister, and people didn’t find novelty in the new party. Do you think so too?Madhav Kumar Nepal has been the most active leader in the party since its inception. Whatever the party has achieved so far is because of him. But a party leader must mobilise teams with defined roles and responsibilities and continuously motivate and engage them in result-oriented tasks. He works a lot but doesn’t mobilise teams effectively. Observers say the Unified Socialist was formed due to the personality clash between top leaders and that it lacked a national agenda and a clear policy to prove the need for a new party. Do you feel so?Our immediate agenda was safeguarding the constitution and ensuring political stability in the country. We protested the House dissolution guided by the same policy. But when provincial governments were made like satellites of the federal government, we couldn’t play any role in stabilising them.The UML is guided by the policy of People’s Multiparty Democracy, propounded by the late Madan Bhandari. There was a debate on further enhancing the policy in the changed context. A large section of Left intellectuals were interested in contributing to that. We could have engaged them in the process. But our party stopped the debate on that topic as well. We missed the chance of engaging many critical individuals in the discourse and having a relatively different policy. When in the UML, we practised direct elections of party representatives and leaders from the conventions. Unfortunately, leaders of the new party, Unified Socialist, made a statute that gave powers to the party leadership to nominate party secretariat, office bearers and other members. Leaders would pick those who are loyal to them. This regressive approach killed competition in the party.You are known to prefer a more proactive work and decision-making approach. There are rumours that you have been fed up with the party’s lacklustre style and are mulling to join the mother party, UML.If I were to decide only from a personal perspective, I would have done so much earlier because I had multiple opportunities in the past. But I am for party merger because I don’t see any relevance of running multiple retail shops under communist banners because we are not substantially different from each other in terms of policies. Our electoral system has also made it necessary. The Unified Socialist can’t run like this. We must accept reality and decide—merging our party with the UML is better than running it this way. But it seems that the top leaders of the twin parties are still bitter about each other.True, the bitterness lingers on, mainly among the top leaders. We have also made some mistakes. The UML offered some opportunities to the Unified Socialist, and we should have made some offers to capitalise on the favourable situation. At one time, UML leaders proposed our party chair as a candidate for the vacant post of the country’s President. We should have devised our own proposal and made a win-win deal. But we ran away and squandered the opportunity. If Madhav Kumar Nepal had become president on the UML’s proposal, our party might have been reunited with the UML much earlier. I also took an initiative to that end but in vain. Later also, UML chair Oli visited our party chair’s residence to have our party on board the government. But the reaction from our side ruined things. We are certainly not responding to the UML responsibly. Rather than irritate the UML, we must turn each positive gesture into an opportunity for party unity.One more factor is blocking the unity between the two parties. There are a large number of second-rung leaders in the UML who can’t directly confront Oli. They are now encouraging former President Bidya Devi Bhandari to join active politics and trying to make decisions in their favour through her. Oli knows these leaders will support Nepal when he returns to the UML. Why would he [Oli] then merge the fringe party and create another power centre against himself? He knows Madhav Kumar Nepal will challenge him with the backing of the dissidents. It is natural for a leader to think twice before allowing another leader of your stature to create a parallel power centre within the organisation. Even I would have thought twice. This is a major factor hindering party unity.Your party chair and other key leaders seem quite close to CPN (Maoist Centre) chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal and critical of UML chair Oli. Moreover, Oli often lambasts Madhav Kumar Nepal publicly. Will they still merge the parties?In principle, our party is open for unity with any Left party. But party cadres won’t join the Maoist Centre. If our leadership decides to merge the party with the Maoists, a huge number of our party cadres will join the UML. Unity between the UML and the Unified Socialist is natural because we grew up in the same background and orientation. But we are quite different from Maoists. Several groups trying to form new political outfits have failed to emerge as a major political force and sustain themselves. You worked in a big party for years and also helped establish a new one. What are the challenges of forming a new political organisation in Nepal?Political parties sustain if they evolve with society. If you trace the history of the Nepal’s Congress and communist parties, you will see how they have evolved over the past seven decades. They competed against each other but joined hands to fight autocratic forces towards establishing democracy. They have done hundreds of progressive things in society. Their major fault is that they have multiple entry points but no exit policy. The only exit way is the death of the leaders. This has caused unhealthy practices and created dissident groups.The dissidents who didn’t get any space within their party formed new outfits. They also amplified negative narratives against the old parties. It happened with the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre. Had there been an exit system in the party, the situation wouldn’t be this bad. But new political parties can’t sustain without their own political ideology and orientation. You may form an organisation, cash in on people’s frustration and achieve some immediate gains, but outfits can’t sustain.But recent electoral trends show that Nepalis are seeking alternative forces and new faces. Can we be oblivious to that?You are right. We have seen such trends in the Panchayat system as well. But garnering votes during elections for one term and establishing a sustainable political force are two different things.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nThe weather across the country is forecast to remain partly to generally cloudy throughout Monday.According to the Meteorological Forecasting Division, light to moderate rainfall, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is forecast in parts of Koshi, Lumbini, Karnali, and Sudurpaschim provinces, with some areas in Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces likely to experience similar conditions.Heavy rainfall is also possible in one or two places in Koshi, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.For tonight, the cloudy conditions are expected to continue.
