Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter the change of coalition partners on March 4, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal sought a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on March 20. Dahal had gone for the floor test after breaking ties with the main coalition partner Nepali Congress, to bring the CPN-UML into the government. On the same day, while addressing the House, UML chief KP Sharma Oli had said, “Despite our continuous efforts to keep the channel of dialogue open with the Nepali Congress leaders, they refused to engage with us.”Oli added, “As we now join the government, we are always open to talk to you, because we aren’t like you.”When Oli was saying so from the rostrum of the House of Representatives, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was sitting in the first seat of the opposition bench, nodded in agreement.Just 100 days later, the political meetings on Saturday brought back that scene of the federal parliament, sparking speculations about new political alignments.“The current ad hoc politics in the country, as acknowledged by the prime minister, is unsustainable. Dahal himself admits that he hasn’t been able to do anything significant since the change in coalition except shuffling ministers. And the Deuba-Oli meeting taking place amid Oli’s public statements that he is not happy with the government, suggests something’s cooking,” claims an opposition leader. A Congress leader close to Deuba speculated that it was probably in 2022 when the Deuba couple last reached the Oli residence, back then to persuade Oli to help the government endorse the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact from Parliament. At the time, Deuba was the prime minister, and Oli was the leader of the main opposition in the House. The new meeting of the chiefs of the country’s two largest parties fuelled speculations about a potential power-sharing agreement. Many construed it as politically meaningful as Oli, while hosting the Deuba couple at his home, skipped a function organised by the Pushpalal Memorial Foundation citing poor health.Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, the head of Congress's publicity department, said the two former prime ministers had serious discussions on issues ranging from national politics, the unfinished decades-old transitional justice process, and possible cooperation to resolve other national issues. “The meeting was positive but it does not mean that the two parties have agreed to form a new government under their leadership,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “But if positive discussions continue, such a possibility cannot be ruled out.”But Rajendra Gautam, chief of the UML’s publicity department, dismissed the possibility of any change in the current coalition.“The Dahal-led government remains stable and the UML will continue to support it,” he said. “The meeting between UML chair Oli and Congress chief Deuba was not aimed at unseating Prime Minister Dahal from power.” The meeting between Deuba and Oli comes just a few weeks after UML chief Oli publicly criticised the annual budget presented by the government. He had termed it a ‘Maoist budget’. The UML chief however later changed his tone. The House of Representatives has already passed the appropriation bill.“The UML chair Oli being critical of the budget does not necessarily mean he is trying to change the coalition,” Gautam claimed. “Our party chair was critical as our lawmakers have several grievances over the budget.”Pradeep Gyawali, a deputy general secretary of the UML, and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, a close ally of Deuba, also denied the possibility of power-sharing between the two parties anytime soon.However, Congress leaders say that if the two big parties come together for power sharing, it would be for amending the constitution and addressing some national issues. A day after hosting Deuba at his residence, Oli met Prime Minister Dahal on Sunday. They were later joined by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the third largest partner in the coalition.The leaders discussed contemporary politics, says an official at the secretariat of the prime minister. “The government’s future initiatives and other important issues were discussed,” a secretariat member told the Post.Some media reports tried to link the Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam. Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam. Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam—and hence Deuba’s meeting with the leader of the biggest party in the ruling coalition. But the Congress leaders argue that the Deuba couple visiting Balkot had no connection to Jha’s arrest. “Even before Saturday, the leaders of the two largest parties in Parliament had met at least twice following the formation of UML-Maoist coalition government,” the Congress leader told the Post. “The latest meeting was just a coincidence.”Though the Congress leader terms it as a coincidence, a question arises: why was the picture of Saturday’s meeting publicised while the pictures of their previous meetings were not? “The previous meetings between Deuba and Oli may not have been formal,” Bishwakarma said. “On Saturday, Oli had formally invited Deuba and his wife, which might be why the photo of their meeting was made public.”Jha’s arrest and the Deuba couple’s meeting with Oli are two separate things, Bishawkarma added. Rumours of Congress-UML alliance have swirled since the formation of the UML-Maoist Centre alliance on March 4. No leaders have given convincing reasons for why the Congress and the UML would want to come together. But some senior Congress leaders do emphasise the need for the two parties to come together in order to amend the constitution and change the electoral system to ensure political stability. A few months back, UML deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal had ruled out the possibility of the two largest parties coming together. The only condition in which the two parties may join forces is if UML chair Oli gets the government’s reins. But Rimal had argued that the constitutional provisions are more favourable to the Congress in case the current coalition falls. If the UML, the largest party in the Dahal-led coalition government, withdraws its support, a new government will be formed as per Article 76 (3). In that case, Congress President Deuba would become the prime minister, which would not benefit the UML.Article 76 (3) of the constitution states that in cases where the prime minister cannot be appointed under clause (2) within thirty days of the date of declaration of the final results of the election to the House of Representatives or the prime minister so appointed fails to secure a vote of confidence under clause (4), the President shall appoint as prime minister the parliamentary party leader of the party which has the highest number of House members. Article 76 (4) relates to seeking a vote of confidence by the prime minister, who is elected without a clear majority and is the parliamentary party leader of the party with the most members in the House. Meanwhile, the Congress has called a meeting of its office bearers and former office bearers on Monday. Party leaders claim that this has no link with Deuba meeting UML chair Oli on Saturday. “It is just a coincidence,” Congress leader Karki told the Post.  \nThe parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the embezzlement of funds in various cooperatives needs to study the financial transactions of around three dozen organisations in detail.Going through their balance sheets and transactions and finding if their lending was legal is a must to understand their reality. Only the experts in accounting and auditing can study the matter minutely. However, neither the lawmakers in the special committee nor the staff from the parliament secretariat assisting them have sound knowledge of the matter. Most of them come from a legal background. And the secretariat doesn’t have adequate funds to hire chartered accountants. “We are capable of making policy recommendations, but we need experts to study the financial transactions,” said an official in the committee. “But we are not in a position to hire independent experts immediately without enough funds.” The committee on June 26 directed nine cooperatives to produce their financial documents. It sought the documents from the Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Samanata Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Savings and Credit Cooperative and the Swarna Laxmi Savings and Credit Cooperative. These cooperatives allegedly transferred money to the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and to other companies and organisations.Similarly, a meeting of the committee on Sunday decided to seek the documents from 20 different cooperatives declared crisis-ridden by the government. It also held meetings with the chairpersons of committees formed in different periods of time to study the problems of cooperatives. Numraj Khanal, secretary of the committee, said consultations continue.“Actual investigation will start once we receive the documents from all the cooperatives,” he said. Agreeing that they lack experts to study the documents thoroughly, he said, “I don’t think it is possible to hire experts immediately. We are thinking of requesting the Nepal Rastra Bank for support, but no decision to this effect has been taken.” The committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday.Ishwari Neupane, a member of the study committee led by CPN-UML’s Surya Thapa, said they hope to start getting the documents this week. “If not, we will have to write again,” she said. After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives in the country. The committee, which has three months to study the issue and prepare a report, has spent a month without starting a detailed investigation.  As per its terms of reference, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The government has so far listed 21 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk. According to the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a total of 59,587 depositors have claimed that the 21 cooperatives have embezzled over Rs36.289 billion of public deposits. Scores of other cooperatives across the country are in trouble but they are yet to be officially declared crisis-ridden. Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problem cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network and other companies and organisations.It will also investigate the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in such illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations to recover the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network that operated the Galaxy 4K television. Rai has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly managed the media company.It took weeks for the parties to agree on the jurisdiction of the committee as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after an agreement to probe all the cooperatives linked to the Gorkha Media Network. \nIn 1988, at the invitation of King Birendra, prime minister of Sri Lanka Ranasinghe Premadasa had visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha. After paying homage in Lumbini Premadasa wished to visit Tilaurakot, an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha. He told his guide Bhikshu Maitri Mahasthvir that his visit would be incomplete unless he saw Tilaurakot. But the monk replied that there was no motorable road to Tilaurakot, which is about 26 kilometres west from Lumbini.The monk then conveyed Premadasa’s wish to prime minister Marichman Singh and transportation minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, who also said that a visit to Tilaurakot would be challenging. A resolute Premadasa then directly requested King Birendra.“Two army helicopters landed in Lumbini the next day. Later it was known that the Royal Palace had sent the choppers to take Premadasa and his entourage to Tilaurakot,” said Maitri Mahasthvir recalling the visit. According to him, Premadasa had expressed great joy upon reaching the historical site. “I feel blessed. My Lumbini visit would have been incomplete if I had not come here,” the Bhikshu quoted the Sri Lankan prime minister as saying during his Tilaurakot visit.An international mission is set to visit the very site of Tilaurakot to evaluate the site for potential inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) plans to visit Tilaurakot in August and later submit its report to UNESCO. There will be discussions after the mission submits its report to UNESCO.The 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, which is scheduled to be held in India from July 21 to 31 this year, will decide the time and venue of the 47th session.ICOMOS has already written to Sudheer Bhattarai, Nepal’s permanent representative to UNESCO who also serves as Nepal’s ambassador to France, regarding its upcoming visit to Tilaurakot.“Following the evaluation, the advisory body discusses the report and makes recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The 47th session of the World Heritage Committee slated in 2025 will take the final decision,” said Gyanin Rai, the senior administrative officer of Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) who is also the coordinator of Tilaurakot Nomination Dossier Preparation Committee.Nepali authorities are hopeful about the council’s visit thinking that it will pave the way for the inclusion of the historical site on the World Heritage Sites list. The LDT has been working on beautifying the Tilaurakot area ahead of the visit. The LDT already issued a tender to dismantle its concrete liaison office.“We notified 37 houses of Shivagadh village, which lies in the west from Tilaurakot, to vacate by July 15. They have been provided compensation. The trust also urged 13 other houses in the area to collect their compensation,” said Sanuraj Shakya, the member secretary of the LDT.The federal government acquired around 50 bigha (around 34 hectares) of land in the surrounding area with the purpose of including Tilaurakot on the World Heritage Sites list. The government has already declared around 100 bigha (around 68 hectares) of land around Tilaurakot as a protected monument zone.The Tilaurakot area, which initially spread in 35 bigha (approximately 24 hectares), now spans around 85 bigha (around 58 hectares), with authorities gradually acquiring more land.The authorities have intensified efforts to clear and beautify the area. “We are working tirelessly to impress the International Council on Monuments and Sites mission. We should accomplish the quest started some 29 years ago to enlist Tilaurakot as a World Heritage Site. For this, support from the local unit, provincial government, federal government and the general public is essential,” said Rai.Bhattarai, Nepal’s permanent representative to UNESCO, had formally submitted the nomination document to Lazare Eloundou Assomo, director of World Heritage at the UNESCO in January. The 21-member World Heritage Committee has the authority to decide whether Tilaurakot will be added to the World Heritage Sites list. Five Asian countries—Japan, South Korea, India, Qatar, and Kazakhstan—are the current members of the committee.A team led by Vice-chairman of the Lumbini Development Trust Lharkyal Lama already visited ambassadors of Japan, South Korea, India and Qatar to Nepal and urged them to support Nepal’s bid to enlist Tilaurakot as a World Heritage Site.Tilaurakot is an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha. The excavation project has been continued in Tilaurakot and other monuments in its vicinity since 2013. The excavation led by British archaeologist Robin Coningham of Durham University, UK unearthed various ruins, coins, pottery, and other artefacts, providing scientific evidence of an ancient civilisation dating back to at least 2,800 years. Recent discoveries and scientific dating of these artefacts also indicate that Tilaurakot showed first signs of urbanisation as early as the sixth century BCAt the turn of the fifth century, travelling through South Asia, Chinese monk Faxian had described a flourishing city along what is today the Nepal-India border. Almost two hundred years later, Xuanzang, another Chinese monk and scholar, described seeing a similar flourishing kingdom.Recently, an archaeological survey that has been ongoing since 2013 has unearthed evidence suggesting that the sites described by the two ancient travellers align with what has been buried underground for centuries.During excavations in Tilaurakot in 2015, archaeologists unearthed 494 ancient “punch mark” coins in an earthen pot during the excavation in Tilaurakot in 2015. During an excavation in Tilaurakot in 2015, archaeologists had recovered 494 ancient “punch mark” coins in an earthen pot. And in 2016, archaeologists had found remnants of houses, roads, walls and wells after three years of digging. Similarly, post holes were also found in the area during the earlier excavation.Based on the findings and its historical as well as archaeological significance, Australian heritage expert Duncan Marshall with support from Coningham, Kai Weise, Yukio Nishimura, Yani Joshi and Basanta Bidari, prepared the nomination dossier for Tilaurakot. Marshall had previously prepared the nomination dossier for the Kathmandu Valley.UNESCO enlisted Tilaurakot in its tentative list in 1996. Since then, the government and the authorities concerned started collecting evidence, facts and scientific data to establish Tilaurakot as a culturally, historically, and archaeologically significant heritage site. If approved by the World Heritage Committee, Tilaurakot will become Nepal’s fifth World Heritage Site after the Kathmandu Valley, Lumbini, Chitwan National Park and Sagarmatha National Park. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says it has been closely monitoring the outbreak of the Zika virus in India, as the spread of the deadly disease is a matter of serious concern in neighbouring Nepal due to multiple risk factors.Currently, Nepal is tackling a dengue outbreak, and the same vectors—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—that spread the dengue virus also spread the Zika virus.“Unrestricted cross-border movements of people from the two countries and the proximity and presence of virus-spreading vectors are the main risk factors,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control section at the Division. “Some hospitals and laboratories carry out other tests when they get negative reports of patients having dengue-like symptoms.”Zika causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with underdeveloped head and brain damage. It is also linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.Last week, India reported three cases of zike infection in Maharashtra state. Since 2016, India has witnessed Zika outbreaks every year except in 2019 and 2020.A risk assessment survey carried out in 2018 with the technical and financial support of the World Health Organisation showed that Nepal was a high-risk country for dengue and Zika outbreaks.Dengue-spreading mosquitoes—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—also transmit Zika and Chikungunya viruses, which means the vectors are present throughout the country.Doctors say all that is needed for an outbreak is a Zika-infected person, which could be anyone. Outbreaks of the disease in India every year and global movement of the people have increased the risk of an outbreak in our country too, according to them.The Ministry of Health and Population had carried out Zika surveillance in the past and tested samples of people having dengue-like symptoms, but the results came back negative, according to Dahal. The World Health Organisation Nepal had provided financial as well as technical support to acquire the technology to carry out the testing of the viruses, officials said.Doctors say Zika virus symptoms match those of the dengue virus—mild fever, rashes, muscle pain, headache, red eyes and a general feeling of discomfort in up to 80 percent of cases.Studies show that pregnant women and their foetuses are at high risk of Zika infection, as the virus causes microcephaly in the foetus.Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, according to the UN health agency. It was later detected in humans. Brazil saw the worst outbreak of the virus in 2015 and it has since then spread to 24 other countries. The WHO had declared Zika outbreak an international health emergency in 2016.Meanwhile, Nepal has recorded at least 1,268 dengue cases since January this year. Of the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nNepal is nominally a federal country being ruled by political leaders and bureaucrats who are still wedded to their old unitary habits. The centre tightly controls and shapes the political structures of provinces. When there is a political ruction in Kathmandu, its tremors shake all seven provinces. This would not have been the case had the provinces been allowed to operate with a high level of autonomy as envisioned by the new constitution. Right now, the provinces cannot even undertake the basic duty of maintenance of law and order. Schedule 6 of the constitution outlines 21 exclusive authorities of the provincial governments, with maintenance of law and order being at the top of the list. Yet the provinces are yet to get their own police forces, which is in contravention of Article 268 (2) of the national charter. The legislation for the adjustment of the Nepal Police personnel was passed way back in 2019. But the actual process has never gotten underway. The reluctant federalists at the centre—including the top leaders of most political parties—are to be blamed for this. Yet they are not alone in being hesitant on the much-needed change. There is disquiet even among police personnel about the new legislation. The Police Personnel Adjustment Act, for instance, authorises the federal government to assign a deputy inspector general of Nepal Police to serve as province police chief. Such officers can be transferred to other provinces or departments of Nepal Police. But in the case of other lower-ranking officers deputed to the provinces, they can then be transferred only within the police units of the respective province. The police force—already rocked by a drastic decline in the interest of youngsters to fill its vacancies—worries that permanently posting certain officials to certain provinces will jeopardise their career prospects. As such, the interest in joining the force would further wane. The police headquarters has intimated to national leaders and lawmakers that there should be more incentives to lure capable personnel into provinces. If that is what it takes to meet one of the core objectives of the federal system, what is stopping the federal government and the national legislature, both of which are constitutionally bound to implement federalism, from pushing for such a change? The representatives of provincial governments are fed up with the lack of the centre’s interest and are again threatening to hit the streets. The internal affairs ministers of all seven provinces plan to meet Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to build pressure. This protracted saga of police adjustment is just one reminder of how hard it is to implement federalism so long as the country’s political leadership remains reluctant to empower the provinces and local bodies. Had there been any willingness to do so, the nitty-gritty of the relevant legislation could have been worked out. Most police personnel are not refusing to be posted in provinces. They are only asking for the right incentives. In order to make the federal system work, ways must be found to bridge the troubling mismatch between the expectations of employees of vital institutions and the incentives on offer.  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nAs temperatures rise, cities across the globe face the threat of extreme heat. Between 2002 and 2010, Nepal had more than two dozen destructive heatwaves, with the most severe occurring in 2009 and 2010, leading to 25 deaths and affecting 280 individuals. Alarmingly, about 80 percent of Nepal’s population is at risk from natural and climate-induced hazards like heat waves.Cities suffer more from heat waves for a few reasons. First is the urban heat island effect, where cities get hotter than villages. This happens because cities are cramped with people, buildings and infrastructure that absorb and retain heat. So, urban centres remain hot even at night when things should cool down, creating a hot bubble over the city that is several degrees warmer than outside. In particular, Kathmandu’s built-up area is almost four times what it was in the mid-1980s. Also, everything we do in cities, like running air conditioners, driving vehicles, working in factories and doing industrial activities, creates even more heat.Additionally, urban centres lack trees or open water bodies to cool things down naturally. This puts city dwellers, especially older people and those with health issues or limited resources, at risk. Addressing these challenges requires innovative urban planning and integrated green infrastructure.Growing threatNepal is witnessing a rise in both the frequency and intensity of heat waves, particularly in cities. The Ministry of Health and Population recently urged the public to take preventive measures against heat waves. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the impact of heat waves became more severe in 2023, making life increasingly difficult. A study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, 2017 showed that Nepal’s average maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius, with most places getting hotter yearly.Heat is causing major problems, especially for the poor and underprivileged. High temperatures contribute to drought, forest fires and floods, posing serious threats to human health, lives and the nation’s economy. For instance, on April 19, 2023, there were more than 2,800 forest fires in Nepal in a single day. Following the massive forest fire across the country, Kathmandu became one of the world's most polluted cities, according to the Air Quality Index. Also, this year, over 4,500 wildfires have been reported in the country, almost double last year's, mostly because it’s getting hotter. These heatwaves don’t just hurt people right away. Being out in the heat for a long time can cause serious health problems and chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Feeling tired, dizzy, thirsty, headaches, leg cramps, muscle pain, vomiting, dizziness and fainting are immediate signs of too much exposure to excessive heat. Heat-related severe illnesses like heat stroke need immediate medical attention, and this puts more pressure on healthcare systems. The economic cost is significant, too, with damage to infrastructure, reduced productivity and increased energy demands for cooling.Recent findingsA recent study in the Theoretical and Applied Climatology journal examines the spatiotemporal characterisation of heatwaves in Kathmandu. It develops a methodological framework and suggests ways to lessen the heat impacts. Utilising satellite-based data, essential for developing countries like Nepal where adequate measuring stations are lacking, the study shows that higher temperatures are concentrated in valleys with high population densities. It is high time we took appropriate mitigation measures in urban planning, building infrastructure and at the household and community levels. The study also highlights a notable rise in extreme heatwave conditions, especially from 2012 onwards. A significant urban warming trend, primarily observed in densely populated regions, suggests that the elderly and youth with limited capacities are highly vulnerable to extreme heat. Mitigation strategiesCities need to plan better and include more green spaces to deal with the growing risk of heatwaves. We must figure out how much cooler and to what spatial extent parks, ponds and forests serve effectively. By optimising the design, distribution and maintenance of green infrastructure, cities can use nature to cool things down and make cities resilient. Parks and gardens don’t just provide shade; they also cool things by letting water evaporate from plants and water bodies. Another strategy involves using appropriate construction materials, such as cool roofs and pavements. Vegetation-covered green roofs can also help keep buildings cooler.Policy implicationsPolicies encouraging the adoption of green infrastructure, regulations on urban heat management and incentives for buildings using cool roofing materials can make a significant difference. Public awareness campaigns are also crucial. We must teach everyone about why green infrastructure is good and ways to stay safe in the heat, like drinking enough water and not toiling too much outside when it is super hot.The escalating threat of heatwaves in Nepal’s cities demands immediate and innovative action. Integrating green spaces, water bodies, and other natural elements into urban design is not just an option anymore—we must make cities good places for the next generation to live. The future of city life in a warming world depends on our ability to innovate and adapt. It is high time to make our cities that withstand the challenges of climate change and be great places to live. It’s a job for everyone—governments, city planners and people from all walks of life—to work together to make cities cooler. \nNepal’s Finance Minister, Barsha Man Pun, on May 28 unveiled a budget estimate of Rs1.86 trillion for the fiscal year 2024-25, followed by similar announcements from finance ministers of the seven provinces on June 15. However, many Nepalis feel their government is indifferent to household struggles to secure enough food, leading some to seek better opportunities abroad. There is a growing concern that the budget formulation process and fund allocation lack public participation, which raises questions about transparency and democratic accountability. This sentiment, particularly resonant among the youth, underscores broader global discontent with governance decisions that affect citizens’ lives. As cities and municipalities worldwide explore diverse approaches to address these issues, Nepal must shed its 18th-century mindset and take proactive steps.Participatory budgetingA wave of participatory policy reforms has emerged worldwide, offering remedies to make democracy more functional and inclusive. Facilitated by advancements in internet and smartphone technology, as well as democratic experimentation, these reforms aim to rejuvenate democracy by fostering inclusive governance and civic engagement. At the forefront of these efforts is participatory budgeting, empowering citizens to identify community needs, collaborate with elected officials to formulate budget proposals and vote on the allocation of public funds.Such budgeting represents democratic governance and captures widespread attention for its transformative potential in enhancing citizen engagement and advancing social justice within public finance. It has evolved into a global phenomenon, catalysing democratic decision-making processes surrounding the allocation of public funds within local communities.Participatory budgeting embodies fundamental principles of deliberative democracy, social equity and citizen empowerment. It represents a departure from conventional top-down approaches to budgeting, advocating for the active involvement of citizens in shaping spending priorities and resource allocations. By facilitating direct citizen engagement in budgetary decision-making processes, participatory budgeting challenges traditional notions of representative democracy, fostering a more inclusive and participatory form of governance similar to the future of democracy: Direct democracy.The process typically unfolds through structured stages, encompassing information dissemination, idea generation, deliberation, voting and implementation. These stages are characterised by a commitment to inclusivity, transparency and accountability, ensuring that diverse voices are heard, decisions are made through informed deliberation, and outcomes are responsive to community needs and preferences. As exemplified by the experiences of various communities worldwide, participatory budgeting initiatives engender a sense of civic ownership, social cohesion and trust in government among participants, fostering a culture of active citizenship and collective responsibility.Practicing countriesMany progressive capital cities from the developed world, notably Seoul and Paris, have distinguished themselves by implementing participatory budgeting initiatives. In Paris, the initiative began in 2014, enabling residents to propose and vote on projects to enhance their neighbourhoods. Through digital platforms and public gatherings, Parisians allocated millions of euros toward community gardens, cycle lanes and cultural events, breathing new life into urban spaces and fostering heightened civic engagement.Similarly, Seoul's participatory budgeting initiative, \"Democracy Seoul,\" launched in 2012, stands as the first programme of its kind in a city with a population exceeding 10 million. Leveraging online platforms and face-to-face meetings, Seoul’s citizens collectively prioritise projects ranging from public infrastructure to welfare services and cultural initiatives. This bottom-up approach cultivates a sense of community ownership and collaboration, enriching the democratic fabric of governance.Participatory budgeting has proven successful even in developing countries with limited internet access. Its introduction in the early 2000s marked a significant shift toward citizen-led decision-making in La Paz, Bolivia. Through neighbourhood assemblies and public gatherings, residents actively prioritise projects, ranging from crucial infrastructure improvements to vital social programmes, focusing on marginalised communities' needs. Nepal's municipalities would benefit from similar participatory budgeting initiatives.India has emerged as a regional leader in participatory budgeting initiatives. Kerala pioneered this approach in 1996, empowering citizens in village meetings to determine 40 percent of state revenues under the Kerala People’s Campaign. From education to agriculture, Kerala embodies grassroots democracy and community empowerment. Progressive Indian cities, starting with Bengaluru in 2001, have embraced participatory budgeting, involving resident associations in municipal budgets. Pune successfully implemented participatory budgeting in 2005, annually inviting citizen proposals and enhancing local governance through elected representatives. Citizens have a month to submit their proposals by filling out the ‘Citizen Suggestion Form’, available online and at the ward office.Participatory budgeting indeed highlights inclusive approaches crucial for responsive democratic societies. While indicative of progress, it must evolve beyond outdated paradigms. A contemporary fiscal framework is essential, enabling direct citizen influence on tax allocation through digital innovations. Taxpayers should oversee fund deployment, scrutinising budget proposals from political entities, governmental bodies, or AI-driven financial structures to ensure public resources align with stakeholders’ priorities. The era of unilateral decisions by political parties, especially ministers and bureaucrats, particularly within the Ministry of Finance, regarding taxpayer capital is swiftly ending. This shift toward semi-direct democracy paves the path for genuine direct democracy, fostering a more engaged and participatory future.  \nPresident Joe Biden's train-wreck debate with Republican opponent Donald Trump followed a series of decisions by his most senior advisers that critics now point to as wrong-headed, interviews with Democratic allies, donors and former and current aides show.Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for \"soul-searching\" or resignations among top aides.\"My only request was make sure he's rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell,\" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. \"What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.\"Others were even more pointed.\"It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.Morgan said Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, the president’s attorney who played Trump in pre-debate rehearsals, should \"be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign.\"Biden's debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.Biden's campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. Multiple aides, not just Dunn and Bauer, were involved in the preparation, said a campaign official, who also noted that Morgan was not there.In an email to supporters Saturday, O'Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters' opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned \"overblown media narratives\" may drive \"temporary dips in the polls,\" but said she was confident Biden would win in November.Biden's trips abroad, especially to France earlier this month, generated Republican social media clips poking fun at his age but, his team believed, it also showed him as a strong leader on an international stage.White House aides who traveled with the president were in a good mood as he headed to Camp David on June 21. They believed Biden was going into the debate with the most precious political asset: momentum, the wind at his back.Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, and to the West Coast, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.As Biden and his aides settled in at Camp David six days before the debate, aides figured he had a lot to accomplish, more than his opponent. Trump could just complain about the present administration - and Biden would need the facts and some zingers at his fingertips.They expected Trump would be far more disciplined and prepared than he had been in 2020 and believed that they would need to counter a string of rapid-fire lies.In lengthy prep sessions, they peppered Biden with details, then followed them up with mock debates.Critics say now that the preparation should have focused on the bigger vision he needs to sell to the country, and that Biden had insufficient rest headed into the debate.Run down, Biden would also catch a small cold, White House aides said, as he has regularly during his term after long stretches of time zone-bending work.The result, critics say, was candidate Biden at his worst: He appeared on stage with his face wan, his hair straggly at his collar and his voice hoarse. He was frequently incoherent.\"I've never seen him perform that way before,\" said Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to President Biden and press secretary for first lady Jill Biden.\"He can run circles around most people on matters of complex policy,\" LaRosa said. \"This was always going to be a matter of presentation and cosmetics, and superficial judgments that were going to be made about his performance. And he wasn't able to clear the bar.\"Earlier this year, some Biden aides discussed whether he should debate Trump at all, arguing that it could give Trump a broad public platform that would disadvantage Biden.Then Biden himself, in an April interview with shock jock Howard Stern, delivered a decision on debating Trump that was a surprise to some advisers. \"I am, somewhere,\" he said.The triumphant memory of his State of the Union address in March fresh in their minds, Biden's team geared up to debate but took radical steps to control the terms.They decided to reject three long-scheduled presidential debates in September and October organised by the Commission on Presidential Debates, still smarting over the group's handling of the 2020 debates.Trump repeatedly violated the rules of what would be a chaotic first debate in 2020, showing up despite having tested positive for COVID-19, and talking over Biden relentlessly.His team tried to set the contest on their own terms, with what they saw as a more pliant host in CNN. No audience cheering Trump's invective. Networks and moderators inclined to challenge Trump. No Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A mute button.The day after the debate, Biden bounced back with a forceful speech in North Carolina, and a pledge to keep going. Many donors and Democrats are rallying around him.But the damage has been done.Asked on Sunday whether the Democratic Party was discussing a new 2024 candidate, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin told MSNBC: \"There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party, because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view.\"Raskin added: \"Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.\" \nEcuador secured a place in the Copa America quarter-finals on Sunday after grinding out a 0-0 draw with Mexico, who bowed out of the tournament after finishing third in Group B.Ecuador, who are looking to reach their first semi-final since hosting the event in 1993, face defending champions Argentina in the quarters, while group winners Venezuela, who beat Jamaica 3-0, take on Canada.Ecuador finished level with Mexico on four points but progress to the last eight thanks to a superior goal difference.In a physical first half, Mexico attacked with real intensity as they sought the win they needed but lacked quality on the ball and failed to record a shot on target.Lozano’s side continued to push after the break and full-back Gerardo Arteaga created a good opportunity after a powerful run into the box, before being denied by a last-ditch tackle from Felix Torres.Winger Julian Quinones tested Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez with a long-range effort in the 65th minute. Dominguez kept out Quinones’ shot with a diving save, with Mexico’s Santi Gimenez blasting the rebound off the post from a tight angle.As Mexico threw bodies forward in their search for a winner, Ecuador increasingly posed a threat on the counter-attack and in the 68th minute Enner Valencia forced a save from Julio Gonzalez with a dipping strike.Mexico were then awarded a penalty in the seventh minute of stoppage time when Torres appeared to bring down Guillermo Martinez but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.“We would like to have a little bit more control,” Ecuador coach Felix Sanchez told reporters.“It’s a very young squad, as I said, and we actually need to be able to overcome these situations in these matches. We know that even if you obtain the results you want, you need to be self-critical and continue improving.”Mexico manager Jaime Lozano is likely to face increased scrutiny after they scored just one goal in their three group matches. \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Monday. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in some parts of the country, while chances of heavy rainfall are susceptible in a few places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has issued warnings for very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province.The weather is expected to stay partly to mostly cloudy till the end of the day.Tonight, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is in some parts of Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province. There’s also a possibility of heavy rainfall in a few areas of these provinces.Meanwhile, a special bulletin has been issued by the Met Office warning of extremely heavy rainfall at one or two locations in Koshi Province and Gandaki Province tonight.Dhangadi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 35.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jomsom was 14.5 degrees Celsius. \nAs the monsoon gains traction, the price of vegetables has soared drastically in the Kathmandu valley, pushing up kitchen costs.Daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes and potatoes are becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary people.Traders say that production dropped due to low rainfall during the pre-monsoon (March-May) period. And with heavy rainfall in the last few weeks, floods and landslides have disrupted the supply chain. Before spring, the winter drought also reduced the output, vegetable traders say. Vegetable prices have gone up steadily in the past few months. According to the macroeconomic report of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index, were up 23.11 percent in mid-May.Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, cowpeas, French beans, bitter gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okara, leafy vegetables, button mushrooms, broccoli, lime, chilli green, capsicum, and cucumbers became pricier within a month.Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetable trading centre, said supply of home-grown vegetables had dwindled right from the winter. The shortfall is met with imports, mainly from India.As soon as the monsoon started, flooding and landslides affected the supply system, sending prices high, he added.And there are no signs of the prices falling. “Naturally, vegetable prices rise during the monsoon as rainfall impacts output and supply.”Shrestha said the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market is receiving vegetables in smaller volumes these days. Before the monsoon the market received 700 tonnes of vegetables daily, but it has now dropped to 500 tonnes.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, the phenomenon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date.The comparative supply figure shows that the daily vegetable arrival in the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market declined 7 percent within a month.Tomato, potato, and onion prices have seen a significant fluctuation.The average wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg within a month. However, the price of small tomatoes produced in plastic tunnels has declined by 42.17 percent to Rs22.67.Shrestha said tomato prices in the summer fall due to increased production as tunnel farming is not affected by rains, and new farming systems have flourished.On June 18 last year, farmers threw around 90 tonnes of tomatoes on the road outside the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market to vent their anger at the low prices they were getting. The price of tomato big (Nepali) had plummeted to Rs35 per kg.Shrestha expected that the tomato price would not dip any lower.The wholesale price of potato (Indian) increased by 9.94 percent to Rs51.67 per kg.The price of Mude potato, produced in summer in high-altitude places like Mude of Sindhupalchok, increased by 4.08 percent to Rs51 per kg. The average wholesale price of onion (dry) increased by 47.09 percent to Rs97.67 per kg within a month. Vegetable traders said that onion prices have increased due to the Indian export tax policy.In May, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne.The price of cauliflower also increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg during the review period. The price of cowpea (short) increased by 23.91 percent to Rs95 per kg, and the price of French bean (local) increased by 25 percent to Rs65 per kg.Bitter gourd now costs Rs45 per kg, rising by 28.57 percent within a month.Smooth gourd price sharply increased by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of squash round jumped 40 percent to Rs35 per kg within a month, while the price of okara shot up by 154.63 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of mustard greens rose 106.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and mustard leaf rose by 55.56 percent to Rs35 per kg.Button mushroom prices increased by 5.56 percent to Rs316.67 per kg.Even in its season, cucumber price has increased significantly. The price of cucumber (local) increased by 58.33 percent to Rs95 per kg while that of hybrid cucumber rose by 80 percent to Rs45 per kg.The price of capsicum increased by 2.27 percent to Rs45 per kg, while the cost of green chilli increased by 25 percent to Rs95 per kg. \nStylish Spain recovered from the shock of conceding an early own goal to eventually overrun a tireless and spirited Georgia 4-1 on Sunday and surge into a mouth-watering Euro 2024 quarter-final with Germany.After withstanding a near-constant early assault, with outstanding keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili making several good saves, Georgia stunned the crowd by taking the lead with their first attack after 18 minutes when Otar Kakabadze’s fizzing cross was diverted into his own net by the chest of Spain’s Robin Le Normand.The Spaniards levelled the last-16 contest through Rodri from the edge of the box in the 39th minute and, after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia almost scored a stunning second from near the halfway line for the tournament outsiders, Fabian Ruiz headed Spain ahead six minutes into the second half.Spain continued to press and probe but the Georgians ran themselves ragged to keep them at bay until Nico Williams finally broke clear to slam in the third in the 75th minute, with Dani Olmo neatly tucking home the fourth goal seven minutes from time to secure their fourth win of the tournament.Spain were mostly cool and confident, barely ruffled by the determination of the Georgians, with youngsters Williams and Lamine Yamal quick, inventive and unrelenting down the flanks.“Against Germany we have to be at our best,” said player of the match Rodri. “We knew it was going to be a tough match. They put us in trouble. We had chances.“It was a pity about the goal, but we showed character and pride to come back. We knew they were going to be a solid team.” \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation has increased petrol and diesel prices with effect from Sunday midnight.The state-owned monopoly hiked the petrol price by Rs2 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs5 per litre.Consumers now have to pay Rs167 per litre for petrol in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.They have to pay Rs166 for a litre of petrol in Surkhet and Dang and Rs164.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj.Likewise, a litre of diesel and kerosene will now cost Rs157 in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal; Rs156 in Surkhet and Dang; and Rs154.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nThe parliamentary special committee investigating the embezzlement of depositors’ funds by various cooperatives has decided to ask for documents from 20 cooperatives that were declared problematic by the government.According to committee chair Surya Bahadur Thapa, the 7th meeting of the committee held on Sunday decided to correspond to get the necessary documents.“Today’s meeting specifically decided to correspond to request the documents of 20 cooperatives that have been declared problematic. In the sixth meeting, we had already decided to request the documents of the other nine crisis-ridden cooperatives,” said Thapa.The committee meeting held discussions with Radha Krishna Mainali, the coordinator of the task force formed to study cooperatives in 1990, Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the coordinator of the task force formed to study cooperatives in 2004-05, and Gauri Bahadur Karki, the coordinator of the commission formed to investigate problematic cooperatives in 2013.The committee, at its meeting on June 26, had decided to seek documents from cooperatives that transferred funds to Gorkha Media Network.Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the chairman of the media house, is accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of rupees in collusion with different cooperatives in Kaski, Chitwan, and Butwal. Rai is currently on the run.After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.As per the committee’s jurisdiction as defined in its terms of reference, the committee will investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulatory arrangements, supervision and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee.The probe panel was formed after the main opposition Nepali Congress disrupted parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding such a body be constituted to investigate cooperative scams.The issue got complicated as Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is the chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, is also accused of misusing the money from various cooperatives. Lamichhane was managing director of Gorkha Media Network before joining politics. \nPolice have arrested former Madhesh provincial assembly member Kaushal Kumar Yadav on the charge of murdering Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police Thaman BK during the Madhesh agitation in 2015.Yadav was produced before the Mahottari District Court on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Santulal Jayashwar, said Yadav was arrested when he tried to flee following an accident in Pokharbhinda of the district.The court sentenced seven people to life imprisonment in the case, but it kept Yadav’s case on hold. Yadav, former provincial lawmaker of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, is accused of lynching the injured APF officer in Jaleshwar during the Madhesh agitation on September 11, 2015. The suspects, along with Yadav, had allegedly dragged injured officer Thaman BK from an ambulance and killed him while he was being rushed to Janakpur for treatment.Pradeep Sah, Sanjay Kumar Sah, Mohan Thakur, Rama Shankar Mishra, Abhiram Sharma, Surendra Pandey, and Dharmendra Raya were sentenced to life, while the court acquitted federal lawmaker Laxmi Mahato Koiri of the CPN-UML.Among them, Pradeep and Sanjay are serving jail sentences while others are on the run. \nFrench voters headed to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country’s first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.“We are going to win an absolute majority,” Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.A woman screamed “It’s shameful, it’s shameful” as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. “They even invited the leftists,” he said.If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.France has had three periods of “cohabitation” - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron’s calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.In Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen’s constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.“So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,” he said.Across France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.‘Split vote favours RN’Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron’s centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron’s most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.“If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there’s a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,” Martigny said.For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron’s camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party’s image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN’s forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.But critics say the RN’s courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners. \nAn employee of the Makalu Barun National Park has been found dead.Keshar Karki, 50, who served as a game scout at the park, was found dead on Sunday in Makalu Rural Municipality-3, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Ghana Shyam Shrestha.Locals reported to the authorities after finding Karki some distance away from the park office. It is suspected that Karki died after falling off a cliff. The police have launched an investigation into the incident. \nAmbassadorial appointments, mostly after the restoration of democracy in 1990, have not been free from controversy. A kind of instability has been created in Nepali diplomacy as those appointed in political quotas are recalled after every government change. As per the recent practice, half the envoys are political appointees while the rest are recommended from among career diplomats.The June 6 decision of the government to recall envoys from 11 countries and Friday’s selection of new faces has yet again raised the question of how long governments will follow the practice that dents the country’s image and makes the conduct of its foreign policy inconsistent.Former foreign minister Narayan Khadka, who is a leader of the opposition Nepali Congress, argues that if an ambassador does not cooperate and support the government and if someone’s performance is poor, the government can recall them, but they should not be recalled en masse.The Cabinet meeting on Friday recommended ambassadors for eight countries while it has yet to pick envoys for three other countries. According to sources in the Prime Minister’s Office, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha was under pressure from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the chair of the major coalition partner CPN-UML, to recall the ambassadors and make new recommendations. An official at the PMO said that Shrestha wanted to recall those who have poor performance and to send ambassadors with good profiles and strong careers. “But that wasn’t meant to be and he eventually had to compromise with the prime minister and the UML chair,” the official said.The recommendation of Bijan Pant as ambassador to the United Kingdom was a major bone of contention between Dahal and Shrestha, said the official. Shrestha did not want to send ambassadors who didn’t have prior experience in diplomacy and international relations. The minister also wanted to avoid sending individuals with controversial backgrounds and those who have gotten repeated opportunities in state affairs, according to sources.The low point of Nepali diplomacy was when the government recalled Ambassador Shankar Sharma from India two days before Prime Minister Dahal’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, said Khadka. “Such decisions are made only by people with zero sense of diplomacy,” he added.Khadka believes that the decision was taken under Oli’s pressure and that the prime minister should at least have avoided recalling the ambassador from India for a few days. The prime minister could have recalled Sharma after he returned from India, he said.“Some ambassadors we picked in 2021 were really good. They deserved continuity but the prime minister, whose own term is uncertain, has decided to recall them,” said Khadka. “This shows the level of our diplomacy, a lack of common sense of our leaders as well as the ugly side of our politics and politicians.”The government on Friday recommended Lokdarshan Regmi, the former chief secretary and Nepal’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, as Nepal’s new envoy to India in place of incumbent ambassador, Sharma. Sharma was appointed under the Nepali Congress quota in 2021 by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Similarly, the government has named former commerce and industry secretary Chandra Ghimire Nepal’s new ambassador to the United States. The incumbent, Sridhar Khatri, appointed in the Congress quota in March 2022, has been recalled. Bijan Pant has been named ambassador to the United Kingdom. Pant previously served as a social development adviser to the erstwhile Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, the late Congress leader, and until recently worked as an adviser to the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). However, this time, he was chosen as an envoy by the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the party’s quota. According to a senior Maoist Centre leader, the sudden entry of Pant has sparked discontent in the prime minister’s party.Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Sushil Pyakurel, has been recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, will replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. Sumnima Tuladhar, a noted child rights activist and Executive Director of Child Workers in Nepal Concerned Centre (CWIN), has been recommended as Nepal's envoy to Denmark.Similarly, Pushpa Raj Rajkarnikar will replace Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal as envoy to Spain. Rajkarnikar is a former member of the National Planning Commission and an expert in trade and financial management.He was picked by the newly formed Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party. The new party also got to pick an envoy for Saudi Arabia, whereby it chose to send Abu Sufayan Khan of Kapilbastu district.In Malaysia, Netra Prasad Timilsina, a long-time NGO activist, has been nominated under the UML quota. He replaces Dilli Raj Poudel, who was appointed under the CPN (Unified Socialist) quota.Among others, Pyakurel, Tuladhar and Timilsina have the background of working in the NGO sector. Of the 11 vacant posts, the government on Friday made recommendations for eight countries. Recommendations for Qatar, Israel, and Portugal are pending. Those recommended get appointed only after parliamentary hearing.Ruling partner Rastriya Swatantra Party will have its say in the appointment of two envoys. But party leaders said they are still unclear which country they will get to recommend the envoys for. “We are still clueless about the countries, but we are nonetheless preparing to find envoys for our quotas,” said an RSP leader.A joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued how the latest episode has again underscored the need for the appointment of more career diplomats. “Political parties may still appoint ambassadors to countries like India, China, and the US, but we must send career diplomats to destinations other than the three countries,” he said. At present, out of 30 Nepali embassies and three permanent missions, 16 are headed by career diplomats. The career diplomats are leading the Nepali missions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Kuwait, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. All three Nepali permanent missions in New York, Geneva, and Vienna are also led by career diplomats.The joint-secretary said the career diplomat pie should increase from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent, or the instability Nepal currently sees would continue. “The appointment of those with controversial backgrounds and despite their conflict of interest have further eroded Nepal’s image abroad. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be avoided in the appointments this time around as well,” rued the foreign ministry official.After 1990, there was the practice of recalling ambassadors after government change but the frequency of such changes greatly increased after 2006, said Yuba Nath Lamsal, former ambassador to Denmark. “If we properly screen ambassadorial candidates before their nomination and send them only after parliamentary hearing, there is no need to recall them so frequently. After all, they have been vetted in the country and have also gotten the required approval, known as ‘agrément’ in diplomatic terms, from the countries hosting them,” he said.Lamsal stressed the need to stop the frequent chopping and changing of the country’s envoys, in order to boost Nepal’s diplomatic credentials. The government in 2019 also came up with the criteria for ambassadorial appointment, but that was not followed by successive governments. Point 5 of the criteria, a copy of which was obtained by the Post, states: In view of the principle of inclusiveness, national welfare and the state’s representation, an experienced candidate with an excellent academic record and diplomatic capability will be appointed the ambassador.Point 6 further states: ambassadors must be capable and have the experience of Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations, and be informed on the dynamics of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.Both of these criteria were ignored this time, just like they were in the past. Very few nominees have any kind of diplomatic experience or credentials. They meet only a few criteria such as being above 35 years of age, holding a bachelor’s degree, not having criminal records and not having been convicted of corruption. However, little attention is paid to avoid the conflict of interest and to meet the criteria of experience in international relations and expertise in the field of diplomacy. The criteria also states that ambassadorial appointees should hold “country-specific knowledge”. But hardly any of the nominees have relevant experience—professional or academic—on issues related to their host countries.Lamsal called for making the selection process transparent so that the host country takes Nepal’s ambassador seriously. “No doubt, envoys should be appointed on merit and they should be allowed to work for some time. Changing them frequently only tarnishes the country’s image,” he said. “This corrosive practice must stop.” \nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \n“It would be most appropriate for us to collaborate with independent forces such as Balen and Gopi Hamal instead of Oli and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal].”This statement by Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal on Wednesday has stirred a debate: are the new and traditional political forces really so incompatible that they cannot collaborate, and how likely is it for the new forces to come together?RSP General Secretary Dhakal emphasised the need for working with new forces such as Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah and Mayor of Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City Gopi Hamal, rather than entering into coalitions and partnerships with older crop of politicians like CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also chief of the CPN (Maoist Centre).Dhakal said so after submitting an assessment report on the RSP’s standing among the people to party president Rabi Lamichhane, who is deputy prime minister and home minister in the Dahal-led government.Dhakal prepared the 32-page report after touring 38 districts and interacting with nearly 3,000 people in a period of one month as tasked by the party soon after its by-election debacle in Ilam-2.After the tour, Dhakal concluded that giving continuity to the partnership with traditional political parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre could prove counterproductive for the RSP in the long run. After the electoral setback in Ilam-2, where the party’s candidate could not even retain the security deposit, an RSP secretariat meeting on May 3 had tasked General Secretary Dhakal with the responsibility of conducting a nationwide tour to assess public sentiment towards the party.Political observers see Dhakal’s call as obvious. As new political outfits get less space to manoeuvre while working with traditional parties, not only the RSP but other newer political forces also find it challenging to assert their relevance.“As the new party that emerged as a political force by capitalising on public discontent with traditional parties failed to outperform them, a negative narrative is taking shape,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post. Any political party needs a political plank to survive for any length of time. However, new outfits lack this, making it difficult for them to work with other political parties, especially the traditional ones, says Bhatta. “When new political parties lack clear agenda and principles, on what basis will they have smooth cooperation with the traditional guards?” Bhatta added. “This is why new political forces will face difficulties while working with the old parties.”But the RSP had a political plank. During the 2022 general elections, the party capitalised on the public disillusionment with the old political parties by promising good governance, and a crackdown on corruption. The anti-corruption campaign quickly propelled the party into national politics within a short time after its establishment. However, the party failed to live up to the political agenda it championed during the election campaign when it joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on December 25, 2022, for the first time. The party quit the government within months after Lamichhane was stripped of his parliamentary position following controversy over his citizenship certificate. The party rejoined the Dahal-led government on March 4 after the changes in the coalition.The RSP leaders have been criticised for failing to live up to their promises and colluding with traditional parties. Dhakal, after submitting his assessment report to party chief Lamichhane, acknowledged that the party failed to fulfil the promises made to voters on the campaign trail. “It was a mistake of the party to ally with the old guards of politics which the RSP heavily criticised in the past,” Dhakal told the Post.Leaders from other new outfits think that it is a compulsion to work with the old forces despite differences in working styles. Chandan Jha, general secretary of the Janamat Party, another new political outfit that emerged after the 2022 elections, says it is natural for new parties to feel uncomfortable while cooperating with traditional ones.“One reason why new parties face problems while allying with old ones is differences in operational approaches between them,” Jha told the Post. “The working styles of new and old ones are different, which makes it difficult to collaborate.”However, given our electoral system that has made it difficult for a political party to secure a majority in parliament, cooperation with other parties is the only way to form a government and survive, Jha adds. The Janamat Party has succeeded in taking the leadership of the Madhesh provincial government by unseating the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal of veteran Madhesh leader Upendra Yadav. Various parties that Yadav led had continuously led the provincial government for over seven years. The CK Raut-led Janamat Party succeeded in displacing Yadav’s party only with the support of traditional parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre. The Janamat Party supported the Dahal-led coalition at the centre and the UML-Maoist coalition backed the party’s leadership in the province. A leader of the Maoist Centre describes the statement of RSP General Secretary Dhakal as a reflection of growing public frustration with the party. The new party that had enjoyed overwhelming public support during the 2022 election is now facing a reality check, says the Maoist leader.“It is true that people disillusioned with traditional political parties supported the RSP and other new outfits during the 2022 elections,” Lekh Nath Dahal, Maoist Centre lawmaker told the Post. “But the level of public frustration is not always the same, and not always against the same parties.”The RSP, which has failed to perform while in government, however, is blaming the old parties for its failure, Dahal said.“What has the RSP done while leading the home ministry?” Dahal questioned. “Like the old parties, the president of a new political party is promoting and transferring police personnel at his whim.” The Post briefly talked to the RSP’s Dhakal on Wednesday, immediately after he submitted the report to party president Lamichhane. He said that the party should explore the chances of collaborating with independent figures such as mayors Shah and Hamal even though the party does not endorse all of their activities.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on some of his plans such as clearing illegally occupied land in slum areas in Kathmandu,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider forming alliances with Shah and Hamal.”But political analyst Bhatta doubts the chances of collaboration between RSP and independent mayors Shah and Hamal. Bhatta says the working styles and issues championed by Shah, Hamal, and RSP leadership don’t match. “However, if they somehow come together, they can possibly be a powerful political force,” Bhatta adds. \n\nDespite experiencing a financial crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka's tourism industry has rebounded due to its rich culture, natural resources, and ancient irrigation system.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n**Summarize the following events in 1 line without losing crucial information**:\n\n1.

Fueled by alcohol, they spew an exorbitant amount of profanity in every sentence. “What a bitch!” they whine repeatedly (among other disgraceful rants.) As their profanity intensifies and they descend into a frenzy, the story unfolds: their female colleague had merely voiced her frustration about feeling underutilised and underestimated in the office. She communicated, though cunningly, about how she was given fewer projects than her male colleague, who contributed little. Communicating assertively about discrimination in the workforce? Indeed! What a bitchy thing to do.Sexist men in the workplace are infuriating beyond belief. This fury and exasperation is amplified in the workforce because sexist men severely underestimate women. They often refuse to collaborate with you due to their long-internalised assumption of female incompetence. ‘Play the System’ is a familiar play because it reflects the common sexism and discrimination women and girls face in the workforce. To sexist ‘corporate bros,’ women are merely decorative, and subservience is a woman’s most remarkable quality. This theatre production capitalises on stereotypes, increasing its relatability. Kausi Theatre's compactness fully envelops the audience, and the wonderful actors completely captivate from the start. You are so intensely focused that you find yourself cursing alongside the characters, feeling their frustration boiling within you, and recollecting similar experiences from your own life.Sailesh (played by Eelum Dixit) is the boss who favours his male colleague over his female counterpart and exhibits severe discrimination against women. Biswas (played by Suraj Malla) is the enabler, a bystander who occasionally voices mild dissonance about women to appease his boss but generally remains silent. Pankaj (played by Rishikesh Basyal) is a stereotypical slacker, all talk and no action, who uses philosophical jargon to mask his incompetence. Chahana (played by Roshani Syanbo) is a quintessential “pick me” character. She is eager to please the men in the office, switching her tone to please them and complying without protest. She is the embodiment of submission, which is why the men in the office tolerate her. Namita (played by Ranjana Bhattarai) is confident, smart, and exceptionally talented, but in this competitive architecture firm, she must navigate the system carefully to be taken seriously.Namita’s theme song would undoubtedly be Taylor Swift's ‘The Man’: “I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I would get there quicker if I was a man.” In contrast to her colleague Pankaj, who garners praise for minimal effort, Namita struggles to secure meaningful assignments and faces pervasive assumptions of incompetence. Even when she delivers, her achievements are frequently overlooked and overtly scrutinised. Her story reflects the broader challenges working women endure in male-dominated fields, where despite their undeniable talent, they are often unfairly judged as sub-par or deemed incompetent.Women often have to go out of their way just to be acknowledged or appreciated. The rat race and corporate grind become even more intense for women due to the additional hurdles they face. Namita has no choice but to become the “bitch” her coworkers think she is, or she won't survive the workplace. Despite the discrimination and frustrations she faces, Namita persists. The dynamics between Namita and Chahana are deeply interesting to watch. Both women are victims of rampant sexism in their workplace, but they respond differently: Chahana bends to the discrimination, while Namita protests against it.From the audience's perspective, neither woman is wrong—they are simply doing what it takes to survive in a male-dominated, toxic environment. They clash over this difference, with Namita judging Chahana for choosing to stay ignorant, while Chahana criticises Namita for being too confrontational and not complying with the 'system' that discriminates against her.Watching these characters interact with one another is highly amusing. A recurring joke about ‘piping’ threads throughout the production, becoming funnier each time the issue is mentioned. The actors skillfully make the audience love and hate them simultaneously—all characters are grey to varying degrees.It can be enjoyable to watch a grey female character; the majority of the audience may even think ‘good for her,’ when Namita cunningly plays games to preserve herself within the system.For women, this play is catharsis. The moment when Namita breaks down, overwhelmed by the realisation that no matter how hard she tries, it is never enough, becomes a pivotal point of emotional release. Watching how Namita is treated by the audience may also help women recognise that, more often than not, they are not the problem; sexism is.This play would’ve easily been five stars if it didn’t have the ending it does. It felt as if the ending drove the play away from the message it was originally trying to convey.However, with brilliant writing, wonderful actors, beautiful set design, and an evocative storyline that represents women’s plight, this play is a must-watch. For me, it might even warrant a re-watch because it delivers an important message while being deeply engaging, funny, delightful, and wholesome at times.It accurately depicts human relationships and is a release for women who have always been suppressed or labelled as ‘bossy’ for simply being competent and confident.Despite claims that feminism is unnecessary and sexism is non-existent (by the Saileshs and Pankajs themselves), the impact this play has on women proves otherwise.With sexism, it is important to take the bull by the horns, as there is no progress in the face of denial. By acknowledging the impacts of sexism, we are actively sparing confident little girls who are unfairly labelled as 'bossy' or 'annoying' from the challenges faced by women like Namita.Play the SystemDirector: Akanchha KarkiCast: Eelum Dixit, Ranjana Bhattarai, Suraj Malla, Roshani Syangbo, Rishikesh BasyalDuration: 1 hour 30 minutesVenue: Kausi Theatre, TekuShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until July 15 \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) will hold its general convention, where leaders negotiate the election of new leadership through consensus or potential contests, while ensuring continuity at the top and aiming to retain members despite diminished influence.\nThe process to appoint the chairman at the Securities Board of Nepal (Sebon) was cancelled on Friday.The Ministry of Finance issued a notice on Friday stating that the recommendation process was cancelled. Back on January 17, the government formed a three-member committee led by the Vice Chairman of the National Planning Commission, Min Bahadur Shrestha, to recommend a candidate for chairman of the Sebon to the Cabinet. Two members of the committee were Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini and Prof Udaya Niraula. As per the mandate, the Shrestha-led committee on February 28 invited applications from interested individuals. However, the Finance Ministry’s notice on Friday announced that the entire recommendation process was cancelled.Earlier, responding to the committee’s call, 19 candidates had submitted their applications to lead the country’s only security board. The recommendation committee later short-listed five candidates for the interview. The five shortlisted candidates were Nabaraj Adhikari, Chiranjivi Chapagain, Krishna Bahadur Karki, Mukti Nath Shrestha, and Santosh Shrestha. However, only two candidates, Mukti Nath Shrestha and Santosh Shrestha, appeared in the interview. Sources inside the Finance Ministry told the Post that both Shresthas were backed by the ruling party, CPN-UML, while Adhikari, Chapagain, and Karki were regarded as close to the CPN (Maoist Centre), the prime minister’s party.After only two candidates appeared in the interview, the recommendation committee informed the three candidates—Adhikari, Chapagain, and Karki—to reappear in the interview and set a new date.Despite this, the three did not appear in the interview the second time. As per the Sebon Act, it is compulsory to recommend at least three names to the Cabinet for the final selection. When the committee failed to recommend three names even after the second round, the Shrestha-led committee sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The Office of the Attorney General communicated to the recommendation committee that the entire selection process would be invalid if three names were not recommended to the Cabinet. “The Attorney General's office explained that it is not possible to recommend only two people who participated in the interview, then we, after consultation with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, decided to cancel the entire process,” a member of the recommendation committee told the Post.The finance ministry official said only two candidates were present in the interview and presentation, so the recommendation committee decided not to risk recommending only two names to the cabinet, which ultimately led to the cancellation of the entire process.“The process collapsed after a tussle between two ruling parties,” an official at the Finance Ministry said, adding that there is a confusion about what will happen next.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.Sebon was established by the government of Nepal on June 7, 1993, as an apex regulator of securities markets. It has been regulating the market under the Securities Act of 2006. The governing board of Sebon comprises seven members, including one full-time chairman appointed by the government for a tenure of four years. The term of Sebon chairman has been fixed for four years, but it has been over three months that the position has been vacant. Due to the government’s failure to appoint a new chairman, security issuance applications worth billions of rupees are pending. \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal, in his political document prepared after a review tour of 32 districts, has claimed that the party is headed for an accident.In his political report, Dhakal has pointed out things the two-year old party needs to rectify in order to avert such an accident. After handing over the 32-page report to party president Rabi Lamichhane on Wednesday, Dhakal told the Post: “After the review tour, I have come to the conclusion that if the party continues to run as it does now, it will crash within a short period.”The report Dhakal submitted to Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, claims that the popularity of the party which emerged by winning 20 seats in the 2022 election has nosedived. Additionally, the report argues that Lamichhane’s popularity has also dipped. Dhakal demanded that the party should make his report public. But an RSP leader, who is also a federal lawmaker, says as the report deals with the party’s internal matters, it should first have been discussed within the RSP secretariat.“General Secretary Dhakal made a mistake by going to the media before discussing the matter in the party,” the leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Why Dhakal went to the media is a curious matter.”However, Dhakal responded that as the general secretary, he came to the media for the first time since the party’s establishment two years ago. “You should understand why the party is being criticised from various quarters today,” Dhakal told the Post. “The party has faced ruin due to someone’s loose talk. I haven’t done so.”Dhakal’s apparent target was party president Lamichhane, who is often criticised for making unnecessary comments and promises. Although the general secretary has submitted a report based on his observations during the review trip, the implementation of the findings will come only after the party’s secretariat meeting, said Kabindra Burlakoti, the organisational committee head and joint general secretary of the party. “The general secretary personally prepared and submitted the report. No other leaders of the party were involved in its preparation,” Burlakoti told the Post. “The report might not be implemented as it is, and the party’s secretariat might amend it.”Soon after the by-election debacle in April this year, a secretariat meeting of the party on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.The RSP had won one more seat in the House of Representatives from the by-elections held a year ago. But this year, the party’s candidate in Ilam-2 did not win enough votes and even lost the security deposit. RSP candidate Milan Limbu stood fourth when independent candidate Dikendra Singh Limbu won third-highest votes in the constituency.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses, in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure. While seeing off Dhakal, Lamichhane expressed his belief that the suggestions and insights gathered during the tour would make the party stronger. The party, which last year secured two out of three by-election seats in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1, was optimistic about giving the competitors a tough fight in Ilam-2 in April. While talking to the Post, party leaders engaged in the campaign were then confident of a good performance. On the campaign trail of the 2022 election, RSP leaders, mainly its chair Lamichhane, fiercely criticised leaders of traditional parties and asked voters to remove them from power. However, the RSP leaders then stood accused of working in collusion with the same old parties and their leaders, especially the UML. Additionally, when Lamichhane was linked to various scams, most recently the routing of the cooperative’s money to Gorkha Media Network, the party lost its lustre, leading to its poor performance in Ilam-2. During the election campaign in Ilam-2, Lamichhane was also questioned over a conflict of interest, as his ministry was commanding the police force that was investigating such scams. The RSP joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on March 4. RSP President Lamichhane won back the home ministry by driving a hard bargain. Some saw Lamichhane’s insistence on the home ministry as an attempt to try to influence the investigation into the cooperative scam. General Secretary Dhakal claims that the party’s popularity has taken a beating, not only due to the cooperative scam but also because of the party leaders’ unfulfilled promises to voters.Before joining the government on March 4, RSP leaders extensively discussed the ‘Mission 2084’ aimed at making the RSP the largest force in the next general elections. Observers said that the party had joined the government even when it is not in a position to honour its promises to the people.Santosh Pariyar, chief whip of the party in the federal parliament, said he is not fully informed on the report submitted by the party general secretary.“I can’t comment on the report without first going through it,” Pariyar told the Post. “We can say something concrete only after the report is formally presented at the party’s secretariat meeting.”However, party insiders claim that the report criticises the party leadership’s rush for power without much care for the RSP’s original agenda. Another party leader, who also asked not to be named, said the report suggests that the party should have allied with leaders such as Balendra Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, rather than joining hands with traditional forces like the UML and the Maoist Centre.Shah is believed to be quietly laying the ground for launching his own political party, cashing in on the public anger against traditional forces.Dhakal also acknowledged that he wants the party to better communicate with Mayor Shah. The RSP should explore the chances of cooperating with him even though the party does not endorse all of his recent activities, Dhakal told the Post.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on an agenda like evacuating illegally occupied land in slum areas,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider allying with Shah.”Despite being in the government, some RSP ministers and party leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction. Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, addressing a function a few weeks ago, said that time had come to review the party’s participation in the government and its support for the coalition. Shrestha even warned the party leaders to be ready to quit the government. Claiming that they carry resignation letters all the time, Shrestha said, “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.” \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nTrouble is brewing for Nepal Airlines after no bidders appeared to buy the Chinese planes in multiple round auctions.The six condemned planes—four 17-seater Y12e aircraft and two 56-seater MA60 aircraft—were acquired between 2014 and 2018 and were worth Rs6.66 billion in grants and loans. One crashed in Nepalgunj.The five planes have been grounded at the remote parking bay on the eastern side of Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu since 2020 and are gathering rust.In July 2020, the board of directors of Nepal Airlines unanimously decided to stop flying the Chinese planes as they cost more money to operate than they brought in.Nepal Airlines twice issued notices to lease them out on September 14, 2022, but no one was interested.Then, Nepal Airlines decided to get rid of them permanently.On January 19, the airline requested proposals for a full appraisal of the two MA60 and three Y12e aircraft. An American company that did the appraisal valued the aircraft at Rs220 million.But fearing selling the aircraft at junkyard price may attract the anti-graft body’s interest, Nepal Airlines management decided to do a separate internal assessment.As per the Nepal Airlines value, the asking price of the MA60s, with registration mark 9N-AKR, was $8,225,501; for 9N-AKQ, it was $4,922,235.Similarly, the asking price for Y12e, with registration mark 9N-AKV, was $2,412,671, 9N-AKT was valued at $2,358,860 and 9N-AKS at $1,658,517.In contrast to the valuation made by the American company, Nepal Airlines set the asking price of five Chinese planes at $19,577,784 (Rs2.60 billion).Now, Nepal Airlines is determined to give one last try to auction the Chinese planes. Officials are working tirelessly, and they believe a successful third attempt is possible, despite the challenges. Failing to get the bidders on the third attempt would put the national carrier under pressure to sell them at scrap value, but the team is not giving up.“We are in the process of starting a fresh auction. This will be the third attempt,” said Devendra Pun, spokesperson (technical) for Nepal Airlines.“There will be a new evaluation of the aircraft rates, and we are hopeful of a positive outcome,” said Pun. The sale of these planes could mark a new beginning for the airline, reducing some financial burden they are responsible for.After spending $20,000 on the international appraisal report, there will be little appetite for another appraisal. Pun said he is unsure whether Nepal Airlines would hire another international appraiser or do it internally.The management had tabled the proposal to auction the planes for the third time at the board on April 2. The board, however, is yet to decide. “The management is carefully considering all options and is committed to making the best decision for the future of Nepal Airlines,” said Pun.Nepal Airlines officials say the grounded planes have been more trouble than they are worth.Operating the aircraft was a massive financial strain, exacerbated by breakdowns and a lack of pilots. The company is in great distress, saddled with a debt totalling nearly Rs50 billion.Officials said the Chinese-made aircraft had turned into white elephants right after they arrived. They doubt anyone will buy them.The national flag carrier put the Chinese planes up for lease on September 14, 2022. Prospective bidders were given an October 31 deadline. As there were no bids, the deadline was extended until November 16. There were still no takers, and the management decided to sell them off.The MA60 is a turboprop-powered airliner produced by China’s Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation. Both manufacturers are subsidiaries of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a government undertaking.The Y12e is a twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, previously Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation.Except for flying to a few airports in the Tarai, these aircraft spent more time on the ground than in the air, even during operating hours.Before the planes were grounded, the total accumulated losses of these planes came to Rs1.9 billion, nearly half of their cost.A brief report submitted to the tourism ministry shows that the airline is paying insurance, parking and regular check-up charges for the grounded planes. Nepal Airlines signed a commercial agreement with China AVIC in November 2012 to procure six aircraft—two MA60s and four Y12es.China provided grant and concessional loan worth 408 million Chinese yuan (Rs6.67 billion) to purchase the six aircraft.Of the total aid, a grant of 180 million yuan (Rs2.94 billion) went to pay for one MA60 and one Y12e aircraft, and a 228 million yuan (Rs3.72 billion) loan was used to purchase an MA60 and three Y12e aircraft.As per the agreement, the Nepal government has to pay 1.5 percent annual interest, a service charge, and management expenses amounting to 0.4 percent of the overall loan taken by the Ministry of Finance.The ministry, in turn, would charge Nepal Airlines an annual interest of 1.75 percent on the disbursed loan amount.As per the November 2012 agreement, China gave Nepal Airlines a seven-year grace period during which it would not have to pay interest or instalments. The planes have completed the seven-year grace period.The loan’s payback period is 20 years or by March 21, 2034. Nepal received the first batch of planes in 2014. However, due to issues with the first batch, the delivery of the rest was stalled for years.The second batch of MA60 and Y12e aircraft arrived in January 2017 as part of the six-aircraft deal between Nepal and China.The corporation received the final two Y12e aircraft in February 2018. The finance ministry owns the planes, and Nepal Airlines operates them.In 2014, marking the beginning of what was supposed to be a new era for Nepal Airlines after acquiring the planes, it had even changed its classic red and blue stripes livery, opting for a more modern design. But these planes never brought happiness and money, said officials.Nepal Airlines—known more for its poor service, planes being grounded most of the time and frequent management changes—has been eviscerated by politicking.Every time a new management team or tourism minister comes in, the process of replacing the Chinese planes with new Western-made regional turboprops begins.A few months ago, a committee headed by the former governor of Nepal Rastra Bank Deependra Bahadur Kshetry suggested selling Nepal Airlines’ Rs4.5 billion worth of shares in Soaltee Hotel to buy new planes for domestic use. \nThree months after Indian citizens were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones in Nepal, the central bank on Thursday permitted Nepali citizens to use a quick response (QR) code payment system in India.In a Thursday circular, Nepal Rastra Bank said it has allowed merchant payment using QR codes and other payment mediums like e-banking, interbank payment, and mobile banking in India and Bhutan.The daily transaction limit for merchant payment is Rs15,000 or Rs100,000 per month. A merchant transaction refers to any payment made by a customer to a business or seller. The service has been opened only for goods and service payments in India.With Nepal’s central bank allowing cross-border payment, Nepali payment system operators say they would begin the service in India soon.In a separate circular, the central bank said that Nepali companies involved in digital cross-border payment systems should get prior approval from Nepal Rastra Bank to sign a memorandum of understanding with foreign partners. “We were allowed to receive the payment by the Indian citizens using QR codes in Nepal. Now, the new provision has allowed the banking and financial institutions associated with Fonepay to make payments using QR codes through their respective mobile banking apps in India,” said Paras Kunwar, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Fonepay. “We will soon begin the service for Nepalis in India.”“Besides a few document works, we are technically ready,” Kunwar said.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay Payment Service has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.According to officials, Nepal’s central bank has introduced a retail payment switch to facilitate person-to-person transactions. Nepal Clearing House, a public limited company, can also transact through the retail payment switch.With the delay in implementing the National Payment Switch, the central bank has provisioned a retail switch for inter-country payment through a quick QR code system.On March 15, Nepal Rastra Bank amended the inter-country payment system through QR code guidelines and introduced a provision for Indian workers in Nepal who have accounts in Nepali banks to send money through e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking, and QR code to Indian banks and financial institutions through the national payment switch.However, a circular published on Thursday provisioned sending money through the retail payment switch until the national payment switch comes into full operation.The central bank has set a limit of INR15,000 per day or INR100,000 monthly for person-to-person (P2P) transfers, which are electronic money transfers between individuals through an intermediary.Laxmi Prasad Prasai, director of Nepal Rastra Bank’s payment department, said the national payment switch may take longer.“The national payment switch has not been finalised. Once the switch is completed, the retail payment switch will be routed through it.” National payment switch is the core infrastructure for routing and settlement of retail transactions, ensuring the interoperability of card and non-card-based payments within Nepal. It includes a retail payment switch for handling retail (non-card) based transactions and retail instruments.The retail payment switch is an operational real-time retail payment switch with additional instruments to support virtual private address-based payment, request-to-pay-based pull transactions, interoperable QR, biller gateway, wallet interoperability, and payment system operator settlements.Card switches and domestic card schemes are currently being implemented.While sending remittances from India to Nepal under the ‘Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme’, Nepali citizens who have accounts in Indian banks and financial institutions can send remittances to Nepal using e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking and QR codes through retail payment switch.The new guideline issued on Thursday states that remittances sent from India will be available in the Nepali currency in the beneficiaries’ bank account or e-wallet.The central bank’s circular states that the concerned banking and financial institutions and payment service providers need to minimise all risks and maximise the benefits of digital transactions.The new amended guideline provides merchant payment for the sale of goods and services by Nepali traders through QR code and other digital payment modes from Indian payment instruments issued. Nepal’s central bank has already opened the digital payment system for third countries, allowing foreign citizens to pay through a QR code for purchases in Nepal. \nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result.

They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nVenezuela hammered Jamaica 3-0 in Texas on Sunday to seal top spot in Group B and set up a Copa America quarter-final with Canada.Goals from Eduard Bello and Salomon Rondon early in the second half, followed by a late strike from Eric Ramirez, ensured victory for the Venezuelan side.Venezuela had already booked their spot in the last eight with wins over Ecuador and Mexico and needed just a point against already-eliminated Jamaica to clinch top spot and avoid defending champions Argentina in the next round.Jamaica’s best opportunity came in the 21st minute but Renaldo Cephas’ diving header soared over.Bello’s powerful downward header put the South Americans in front in the 49th minute and Rondon doubled their lead seven minutes later with a scuffed effort past Jamaica keeper Jahmali Waite.It was Rondon’s 43rd international goal, extending his record as Venezuela’s highest scorer.Ramirez added Venezuela’s third on the breakaway in the 85th minute, sending a right-footed shot under the advancing Waite after a well-timed pass from Kervin Andrade.Venezuela were joined in the last eight by Group B runners-up Ecuador, who qualified thanks to their superior goal difference after holding Mexico 0-0 in the other match, with both teams tied on four points. \nJude Bellingham rescued England from crashing out of Euro 2024 against Slovakia on Sunday with a stunning 95th-minute equaliser before Harry Kane’s early extra-time winner sent the below-par pre-tournament favourites into the quarter-finals.England were once again poor, looking lethargic and unable to create clear openings, but a moment of magic from Bellingham, who fired home with a bicycle kick, kept them alive before Kane’s header set up a clash with Switzerland in Duesseldorf on Saturday.Slovakia started far sharper than England and gave their opponents several warnings before Ivan Schranz placed a deft finish past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the 25th minute.Kane uncharacteristically headed a Foden free kick wide and Declan Rice hit the post as Slovakia were pinned deep in their own half late on, though England seemed to lack belief as their fans grew ever more frustrated.But Bellingham, a day after his 21st birthday, equalised with an incredible effort to take the game to extra time with England’s first shot on target.“What an unbelievable goal, he’s kept our tournament alive,” Kane told ITV, describing Bellingham’s goal as “one of the best in our country’s history”.“You’re 30 seconds away from going home, feeling like you’ve let your nation down, and one kick of the ball and everything’s great,” Bellingham said. “It’s a feeling I don’t want to be in but, when it comes, it’s a great feeling.”England took less than a minute of extra time to take the lead when Kane headed past the despairing Martin Dubravka from close range to complete a remarkable turnaround.Slovakia had faded as the game drew on and went closest to an equaliser of their own just before halftime in extra time, when Peter Pekarik kneed a dangerous cross over the bar.England repelled a late wave of balls into the box to secure a fortunate victory and their progress to the next round, when they will need to be far better against the Swiss who outplayed defending champions Italy in the last-16.The win will not protect England manager Gareth Southgate from criticism, however, after he took 66 minutes to make a substitution despite his side looking bereft of ideas. \nLautaro Martinez struck twice in the second half to help Argentina’s second string beat Peru 2-0 at the Copa America on Saturday and finish top of Group A, knocking Peru out of the tournament.Martinez, featuring in the starting line-up for the first time in the competition, found the net in the 47th and 86th minutes, scoring for a third straight match.The Inter Milan striker finished off a flowing move in the 47th minute, coolly chipping the ball over Peru keeper Pedro Gallese, and repeated the trick in the 86th minute, chipping Gallese again for his second goal after some sloppy defending by Peru.“I’m happy, because I was able to score in the three group-stage games and because I was able to help the team, which is what counts,” Martinez, who was criticised for his performances in Argentina's World Cup-winning campaign in 2022, told TyC Sports.Despite the absence of their coach Lionel Scaloni, suspended and fined for late second-half starts in two previous matches, and a much-changed starting line-up, Argentina were largely untroubled by their opponents.They dominated possession in the first half and had three attempts on target, but Peru’s goalkeeper Gallese kept the scoreline respectable with a string of saves, the most notable of which came from a well-struck free kick by Leandro Paredes in the 26th minute.The defending champions had a gilt-edged chance to extend their lead when they were awarded a penalty for handball in the 72nd minute, but Paredes smashed his spot-kick off the post.Argentina had already qualified for the quarter-finals before the match in Miami with wins over Canada and Chile, the other teams in the group.That security allowed the defending champions to rest key players, including captain Lionel Messi.Messi, who celebrated his 37th birthday on Monday, is recovering from a thigh injury he picked up during their win over Chile on Tuesday. He is expected to return for their quarter-final match on Thursday in Houston against the Group B runner-up.They will be joined in the knockout rounds by group runners-up Canada, who qualified for the last eight after holding Chile to a 0-0 draw in the other Group A match. \nA Russian missile strike hit a nine-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring 12 others, officials said.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko warned the death toll would likely rise as more people remained trapped in the building where four upper storeys collapsed as a result of the attack.Later statements from the Interior Ministry said the fire at the site had been extinguished, the remains of one person had been detected underneath the rubble and two people were listed as missing.Regional governor Serhiy Lysak said 12 people had been injured, including a 7-month-old infant. Three people were in severe condition.A photograph published by Lysak on the Telegram messaging app and other images circulated on social media showed a badly damaged building that had smoke rising from a gaping hole in its upper storeys.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s allies to step up supplies of air defences to help the military intercept Russia’s regular aerial attacks.Dnipro, which had a pre-war population of almost one million people, is a major Ukrainian city that lies on the road to the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is raging.It has been regularly targeted by missile and drone strikes since Russia launched its February 2022 invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, but thousands of people have been killed. \nA powerful earthquake of magnitude of 7.0 struck near the coast in southern Peru’s Arequipa region on Friday, local officials said, adding no deaths had been reported.A total of eight people have been injured. The Chief of Disaster Risk Management and National Defense at the Ministry of Health, David Aponte, informed local radio station RPP of three minor injuries. Later, the Ministry of Health reported another five injured people had been treated in hospitals nearby.Following the earthquake, Arequipa was hit by four aftershocks of 4 to 4.6 magnitude, causing some landslides on local roads.The government said on social media it was monitoring to assess the damage and “determine the actions to be taken”.The US National Tsunami Warning Center had said there was a tsunami threat from the quake, adding waves of between 1 and 3 metres (9.84 ft) above the tide level had been recorded along some parts of Peru’s coast.Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen, however, said the tsunami warning on the coast of Arequipa had been discarded.Carlos Zanabria, an adviser to the regional government of Arequipa, told local radio station RPP, material damage had been reported in some districts and residents had left their homes in fear, but he had heard no reports of death or injury.Flavio Aranguren, the mayor of Yauca district in Arequipa’s Caraveli province, told RPP some walls of houses in the district had collapsed. He also said no fatalities had been reported.Small artisanal gold mines operate in the town of Yauca and other neighboring towns near the coast, but there was no information available so far about any impact.Ricardo Guillen, representative of the National Emergency Operations Center, said that there have been power and telephone line outages in areas near the epicenter of the earthquake.Ecuador and Peru are part of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an extensive area that surrounds the Pacific Ocean where clashes between the continental plates are frequent. \nA roof collapsed under heavy rainfall and winds at the main airport in India’s capital New Delhi on Friday, killing one person and leading to the cancellation of flights from a domestic terminal, officials said.A portion of the canopy at the departure area of Delhi airport’s Terminal 1 collapsed early in the morning and flight operations were shut down until 2 p.m. (0830 GMT), India’s aviation minister told reporters.The entire terminal, one of three at the country’s busiest airport, has been evacuated and an inquiry ordered into the collapse, said the minister, Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu.At least 10 flights were cancelled and 40 were delayed, according to data from flight tracking platform Flightradar24.Eight injured people were taken to hospital and the rescue operation had been completed, said Atul Garg, the director of Delhi Fire Service.Visuals from Indian TV channels showed a taxi crushed under a wrecked metal pillar at the entrance area of the terminal, which is mostly used by low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet (SPJT.BO), opens new tab for domestic flights.Indigo is operated by Interglobe Aviation (INGL.NS), opens new tab.The incident happened at 5 a.m. (2330 GMT Thursday), usually a busy time for domestic flights carrying people across the country, a statement from the airport posted on X said.The airport area received about 148.5 millimetres of rain over three hours in the early morning, more than the average for all of June, according to India’s weather office.Many other parts of Delhi were flooded as well and cars trapped in thigh-deep water. Metro services were affected and traffic snarls were reported from several parts of the city.Several residents in Delhi also complained of power cuts.In India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 20 people died in various rain and flood-related incidents in the last 48 hours, including seven due to lightning strikes, officials said.GMR Airports Infrastructure (GMRI.NS), which operates Delhi International Airport, is also its top shareholder with a 64% stake. Its shares fell as much as 2.1% in early trade. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nLast week, in a surprise development likely weeks in the planning, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was able to leave the United Kingdom for the first time in more than a decade after reaching a plea deal with the US government.In the past several months, momentum has been building towards this moment. There was increasing bipartisan support in both the Australian parliament and the US Congress for the Australian citizen’s release. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made repeated statements on his behalf, and in April, US President Joe Biden said he was “considering” a request from Australia to drop its prosecution of Assange.This all contributed to the sense the matter might be resolved before Assange’s final UK hearing date, previously scheduled for July 9 and 10. The timing of the deal is also a welcome prelude to Albanese’s potential visit to Washington in early July.The United States’ pursuit of Assange has seemingly been relentless since WikiLeaks posted hundreds of thousands of classified military documents in 2010. It wasn’t until 2019 under then President Donald Trump, however, that he was finally indicted on 17 counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act.The charges against Assange were not just considered unprecedented, they raised significant First Amendment concerns.The apparent desire to punish Assange for the embarrassment caused by the leaks—and to deter others from taking similar action—was so strong the CIA allegedly discussed plans to kidnap and even assassinate Assange during the Trump administration, according to US media reports.In the UK courts, the US Department of Justice had argued Assange should be subject to US law and extradited to face trial for his actions. However, as a non-citizen, there were questions over whether he could rely on the legal protections afforded by those same laws—particularly the constitutional right to free speech.The successful extradition of Assange could have set a precedent by which the US could pursue journalists anywhere in the world for publishing information it did not like, while potentially denying them their fundamental First Amendment rights.In a crucial election year in the US that President Joe Biden is framing as an existential fight for the soul of US democracy, the continued pursuit of Assange was as inconsistent as it was ultimately untenable. Viewed from the outside, it appeared the case was causing the Biden administration international embarrassment.Biden has been careful to maintain an appropriate distance between the presidency and the Department of Justice. He came into office promising to restore faith in the rule of law following the Trump years and has meticulously avoided any appearance of interference in the department’s work as it has investigated and indicted his predecessor.Assange’s case, however, is wholly different to the charges on which Trump has been indicted. It is certainly possible to interpret Biden’s comment that he was “considering” dropping the charges as a gentle public rebuke of the Department of Justice’s pursuit of the case, given its global implications for a free press.The continued pursuit of Assange was also becoming problematic in the context of Australia’s alliance with the US. That relationship is always described as one based on shared democratic values, in contrast to what Biden has repeatedly framed as the coercive and repressive instincts of “authoritarian” powers.The decision by the US to pursue a citizen of one of its closest allies for the publication of information, while simultaneously condemning authoritarian states for doing much the same, was both hypocritical and damaging to American standing in the world.In the context of growing concern in Australia about the terms of the AUKUS submarine deal and the Australian government’s willingness to go “all-in” with the US militarily, the continued pursuit of Assange gave the impression that Australia’s most important security ally did not take its concerns seriously. Australia appeared simply to be snapping at America’s heels.It also added to the sense that the “capital-A Alliance” between the two countries was increasingly dominated by security concerns, often at the expense of democratic accountability.Because of the international campaign to free Assange and the support it received in both Australian and American democratic institutions, there appears to be have been a reconsideration of this focus on security interests over democratic values.It should be noted, though, that the US didn’t drop its prosecution in the end; Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge of violating the Espionage Act, which in itself may set a concerning precedent for press freedom.And the fact this saga happened at all—and that it has taken more than a decade to get close to resolution—should prompt deep reflection on the values that underpin both Australia’s relationship with its most important security ally and the United States’ role in the world.-The Conversation  \nNepal’s membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trading system, marked 20 years in April 2024. After 14 years of an arduous accession process that began in 1989, the fifth WTO Ministerial Meeting in 2003 approved Nepal's membership, and the country formally joined the organisation in April 2004 after the government ratified it. Nepal had two main reasons to enter into the multilateral trading system, despite its complexities. First, it was indispensable for Nepal to fill the void in its external trade caused by the termination of its trade and transit agreements with India, which shared almost 90 percent of the country’s external trade at that time. Second, the multilateral trading system could help diversify Nepal’s India-dominated external trade with third countries, as stipulated in its plans and policies until the late 80s. Nepal’s objectives in joining the WTO were to guarantee transit rights and trade diversification under non-discriminatory treatment in trade with its partners, as assured by the basic norms of the multilateral trading system. However, Nepal’s affiliation to the WTO can also be evaluated for other reasons. When Nepal joined the WTO, the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations, initiated in 2001 (yet to be concluded), was at the centre of global attention because it embraced the interests of both developed and developing countries. The Doha Round has special bearings for Nepal. Renowned for the understanding to cut agriculture subsidies and tariffs as well as to improve market access for non-agriculture products, the essence of the Doha Round for the least-developed countries (LDCs), including Nepal, rested on the introduction of preferential market access for the first time under the multilateral system. It was later incorporated into the Doha agenda as a duty- and quota-free programme. The agenda included trade capacity building provision through the Aid for Trade programme to compensate for trade losses of such countries due to the erosion of preference as world average tariff rates are reduced under the multilateral system. This suggested that the value of trade preference would diminish with the erosion of preference margins for Nepal’s trade, whereas the preference would gradually lose its importance after Nepal graduates from LDC status in 2026. The LDC-specific preference is not permitted for non-LDCs under different preferential schemes, including the popular Generalised System of Preference programme. Thus, Nepal’s fate in the WTO will eventually depend on its trade efficiency and trade policy rather than the preferential treatment. Nepal must do many things to reap the benefits of its WTO membership. First and foremost, it is necessary to assess our bilateral trade agreements vis-à-vis the country’s current trade regime, which is already under the multilateral system. Except for the trade treaty with India, Nepal’s other bilateral agreements seem redundant in this context. Nepal’s trade agreement with India includes partially reciprocal trade preferences at its core and goes deeper than the multilateral system. However, the rest of the others are confined to the most favoured nation (MFN) treatment concerning customs tariffs and trade procedures, almost equivalent to the WTO’s MFN treatment or the principle of trade without discrimination. That means such agreements are superfluous unless they have distinctive features from the WTO system. Therefore, Nepal should revise the bilateral agreements, giving due consideration to the issues that do not fall under the WTO mechanism. For example, the bilateral trade negotiations could be an effective means to sort out the problem of non-tariff measures (NTMs), which are intense in Nepal’s trade enhancement and diversification initiative. The NTMs have been problematic even during the WTO negotiations. Paradoxically, the domestically ingrained NTMs are more detrimental to Nepal’s trade endeavour than the non-tariff barriers subjected to its trade with partners, according to a study by the International Trade Centre. In addition to the challenges, there is a rationale behind Nepal’s membership in the WTO. One of the most significant aspects is the predictable trading environment guaranteed by the WTO principles, which are based on non-discrimination, fair trade and transparency. Furthermore, in the case of unfair trade practices, the WTO has contingency measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties, to defend the country’s trade interests from such incidents. And there is a powerful dispute settlement mechanism at its disposal to sort out the trade wrangling, if any. These measures are worthwhile as the country’s trade expands.It is worth mentioning some achievements Nepal made after entering the WTO. Backed by the policy of free trade, Nepal’s exports have grown steadily in the face of escalated import trade since it pursued the multilateralism policy. The liberalisation of import trade has helped the country diversify its exports through comparative advantage. Nepal’s achievement in the area of service trade cannot be undermined with respect to export prospects and diversification. Besides these accomplishments, Nepal has also made strides in trade-related laws. While the rules on intellectual property rights—one of the strict WTO requirements—have been introduced, the laws dealing with competition and anti-dumping, which are prerequisites to international business, are also effective now. However, this is not the end of the challenges. Nepal’s benefits from WTO membership will rely on its dedication to an enabling trading environment. This will also depend on its ability to adapt to the multilateral trading system, which is facing a credibility crisis following the Doha deadlock and the growing threat of protectionism in recent years.           \nSEE results reveal a dismal 47.86% pass rate, with 52.14% of students failing and highlighting the urgent need for a complete overhaul of the teaching-learning system in Nepal.\nJulian Assange, famed for releasing classified documents through WikiLeaks, was released from prison after 14 years of legal battles involving asylum and incarceration.\nHaphazard road construction and riverbed extraction in Nepal pose environmental risks, including flooding and landslides, despite legal prohibitions and government apathy.\nClimate change is shifting the distribution and severity of diseases and natural disasters in Nepal, with deadly snakes reaching mountainous districts and dengue spreading widely, requiring urgent upgrades to infrastructure and understanding.\nIndia's recent recall of Nepal's ambassador, the progress of trade agreements with China under BRI, and the outcomes of Prime Minister Dahal's Delhi visit highlight Nepal's diplomatic relations and the importance of establishing a rational system for ambassadorial appointments.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nSunday’s weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy.Expect light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in many areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpashchim provinces.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter the change of coalition partners on March 4, Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal sought a vote of confidence in the House of Representatives on March 20. Dahal had gone for the floor test after breaking ties with the main coalition partner Nepali Congress, to bring the CPN-UML into the government. On the same day, while addressing the House, UML chief KP Sharma Oli had said, “Despite our continuous efforts to keep the channel of dialogue open with the Nepali Congress leaders, they refused to engage with us.”Oli added, “As we now join the government, we are always open to talk to you, because we aren’t like you.”When Oli was saying so from the rostrum of the House of Representatives, Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba, who was sitting in the first seat of the opposition bench, nodded in agreement.Just 100 days later, the political meetings on Saturday brought back that scene of the federal parliament, sparking speculations about new political alignments.“The current ad hoc politics in the country, as acknowledged by the prime minister, is unsustainable. Dahal himself admits that he hasn’t been able to do anything significant since the change in coalition except shuffling ministers. And the Deuba-Oli meeting taking place amid Oli’s public statements that he is not happy with the government, suggests something’s cooking,” claims an opposition leader. A Congress leader close to Deuba speculated that it was probably in 2022 when the Deuba couple last reached the Oli residence, back then to persuade Oli to help the government endorse the US Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) compact from Parliament. At the time, Deuba was the prime minister, and Oli was the leader of the main opposition in the House. The new meeting of the chiefs of the country’s two largest parties fuelled speculations about a potential power-sharing agreement. Many construed it as politically meaningful as Oli, while hosting the Deuba couple at his home, skipped a function organised by the Pushpalal Memorial Foundation citing poor health.Min Bahadur Bishwakarma, the head of Congress's publicity department, said the two former prime ministers had serious discussions on issues ranging from national politics, the unfinished decades-old transitional justice process, and possible cooperation to resolve other national issues. “The meeting was positive but it does not mean that the two parties have agreed to form a new government under their leadership,” Bishwakarma told the Post. “But if positive discussions continue, such a possibility cannot be ruled out.”But Rajendra Gautam, chief of the UML’s publicity department, dismissed the possibility of any change in the current coalition.“The Dahal-led government remains stable and the UML will continue to support it,” he said. “The meeting between UML chair Oli and Congress chief Deuba was not aimed at unseating Prime Minister Dahal from power.” The meeting between Deuba and Oli comes just a few weeks after UML chief Oli publicly criticised the annual budget presented by the government. He had termed it a ‘Maoist budget’. The UML chief however later changed his tone. The House of Representatives has already passed the appropriation bill.“The UML chair Oli being critical of the budget does not necessarily mean he is trying to change the coalition,” Gautam claimed. “Our party chair was critical as our lawmakers have several grievances over the budget.”Pradeep Gyawali, a deputy general secretary of the UML, and Gyanendra Bahadur Karki, a close ally of Deuba, also denied the possibility of power-sharing between the two parties anytime soon.However, Congress leaders say that if the two big parties come together for power sharing, it would be for amending the constitution and addressing some national issues. A day after hosting Deuba at his residence, Oli met Prime Minister Dahal on Sunday. They were later joined by Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Home Affairs Rabi Lamichhane, who is also the president of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, the third largest partner in the coalition.The leaders discussed contemporary politics, says an official at the secretariat of the prime minister. “The government’s future initiatives and other important issues were discussed,” a secretariat member told the Post.Some media reports tried to link the Deuba-Oli meeting with yet another development, as it took place a day after Nepal Police arrested Bechan Jha, one of the alleged middlemen in the high-profile Bhutanese refugee scam. Police last year filed cases against politicians, bureaucrats and middlemen on charges of defrauding hundreds of people by promising to send them to the US as Bhutanese refugees. But police were not able to book Jha despite his connection with the scam. Jha is allegedly close to many political leaders, including senior Congress leaders, and the Congress leadership might have been worried that they too could be dragged into the refugee scam—and hence Deuba’s meeting with the leader of the biggest party in the ruling coalition. But the Congress leaders argue that the Deuba couple visiting Balkot had no connection to Jha’s arrest. “Even before Saturday, the leaders of the two largest parties in Parliament had met at least twice following the formation of UML-Maoist coalition government,” the Congress leader told the Post. “The latest meeting was just a coincidence.”Though the Congress leader terms it as a coincidence, a question arises: why was the picture of Saturday’s meeting publicised while the pictures of their previous meetings were not? “The previous meetings between Deuba and Oli may not have been formal,” Bishwakarma said. “On Saturday, Oli had formally invited Deuba and his wife, which might be why the photo of their meeting was made public.”Jha’s arrest and the Deuba couple’s meeting with Oli are two separate things, Bishawkarma added. Rumours of Congress-UML alliance have swirled since the formation of the UML-Maoist Centre alliance on March 4. No leaders have given convincing reasons for why the Congress and the UML would want to come together. But some senior Congress leaders do emphasise the need for the two parties to come together in order to amend the constitution and change the electoral system to ensure political stability. A few months back, UML deputy general secretary Bishnu Rimal had ruled out the possibility of the two largest parties coming together. The only condition in which the two parties may join forces is if UML chair Oli gets the government’s reins. But Rimal had argued that the constitutional provisions are more favourable to the Congress in case the current coalition falls. If the UML, the largest party in the Dahal-led coalition government, withdraws its support, a new government will be formed as per Article 76 (3). In that case, Congress President Deuba would become the prime minister, which would not benefit the UML.Article 76 (3) of the constitution states that in cases where the prime minister cannot be appointed under clause (2) within thirty days of the date of declaration of the final results of the election to the House of Representatives or the prime minister so appointed fails to secure a vote of confidence under clause (4), the President shall appoint as prime minister the parliamentary party leader of the party which has the highest number of House members. Article 76 (4) relates to seeking a vote of confidence by the prime minister, who is elected without a clear majority and is the parliamentary party leader of the party with the most members in the House. Meanwhile, the Congress has called a meeting of its office bearers and former office bearers on Monday. Party leaders claim that this has no link with Deuba meeting UML chair Oli on Saturday. “It is just a coincidence,” Congress leader Karki told the Post.  \nThe parliamentary special committee formed to investigate the embezzlement of funds in various cooperatives needs to study the financial transactions of around three dozen organisations in detail.Going through their balance sheets and transactions and finding if their lending was legal is a must to understand their reality. Only the experts in accounting and auditing can study the matter minutely. However, neither the lawmakers in the special committee nor the staff from the parliament secretariat assisting them have sound knowledge of the matter. Most of them come from a legal background. And the secretariat doesn’t have adequate funds to hire chartered accountants. “We are capable of making policy recommendations, but we need experts to study the financial transactions,” said an official in the committee. “But we are not in a position to hire independent experts immediately without enough funds.” The committee on June 26 directed nine cooperatives to produce their financial documents. It sought the documents from the Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, the Image Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sahara Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Samanata Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sano Paila Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Supreme Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Surya Darshan Savings and Credit Cooperative, the Sumeru Savings and Credit Cooperative and the Swarna Laxmi Savings and Credit Cooperative. These cooperatives allegedly transferred money to the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and to other companies and organisations.Similarly, a meeting of the committee on Sunday decided to seek the documents from 20 different cooperatives declared crisis-ridden by the government. It also held meetings with the chairpersons of committees formed in different periods of time to study the problems of cooperatives. Numraj Khanal, secretary of the committee, said consultations continue.“Actual investigation will start once we receive the documents from all the cooperatives,” he said. Agreeing that they lack experts to study the documents thoroughly, he said, “I don’t think it is possible to hire experts immediately. We are thinking of requesting the Nepal Rastra Bank for support, but no decision to this effect has been taken.” The committee’s next meeting is scheduled for Tuesday.Ishwari Neupane, a member of the study committee led by CPN-UML’s Surya Thapa, said they hope to start getting the documents this week. “If not, we will have to write again,” she said. After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives in the country. The committee, which has three months to study the issue and prepare a report, has spent a month without starting a detailed investigation.  As per its terms of reference, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The government has so far listed 21 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk. According to the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee, a total of 59,587 depositors have claimed that the 21 cooperatives have embezzled over Rs36.289 billion of public deposits. Scores of other cooperatives across the country are in trouble but they are yet to be officially declared crisis-ridden. Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problem cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network and other companies and organisations.It will also investigate the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in such illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations to recover the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network that operated the Galaxy 4K television. Rai has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him. Rai and Lamichhane co-founded and jointly managed the media company.It took weeks for the parties to agree on the jurisdiction of the committee as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after an agreement to probe all the cooperatives linked to the Gorkha Media Network. \nIn 1988, at the invitation of King Birendra, prime minister of Sri Lanka Ranasinghe Premadasa had visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Gautam Buddha. After paying homage in Lumbini Premadasa wished to visit Tilaurakot, an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha. He told his guide Bhikshu Maitri Mahasthvir that his visit would be incomplete unless he saw Tilaurakot. But the monk replied that there was no motorable road to Tilaurakot, which is about 26 kilometres west from Lumbini.The monk then conveyed Premadasa’s wish to prime minister Marichman Singh and transportation minister Prakash Chandra Lohani, who also said that a visit to Tilaurakot would be challenging. A resolute Premadasa then directly requested King Birendra.“Two army helicopters landed in Lumbini the next day. Later it was known that the Royal Palace had sent the choppers to take Premadasa and his entourage to Tilaurakot,” said Maitri Mahasthvir recalling the visit. According to him, Premadasa had expressed great joy upon reaching the historical site. “I feel blessed. My Lumbini visit would have been incomplete if I had not come here,” the Bhikshu quoted the Sri Lankan prime minister as saying during his Tilaurakot visit.An international mission is set to visit the very site of Tilaurakot to evaluate the site for potential inclusion as a UNESCO World Heritage Site. The International Council on Monuments and Sites (ICOMOS) plans to visit Tilaurakot in August and later submit its report to UNESCO. There will be discussions after the mission submits its report to UNESCO.The 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, which is scheduled to be held in India from July 21 to 31 this year, will decide the time and venue of the 47th session.ICOMOS has already written to Sudheer Bhattarai, Nepal’s permanent representative to UNESCO who also serves as Nepal’s ambassador to France, regarding its upcoming visit to Tilaurakot.“Following the evaluation, the advisory body discusses the report and makes recommendations to the World Heritage Committee. The 47th session of the World Heritage Committee slated in 2025 will take the final decision,” said Gyanin Rai, the senior administrative officer of Lumbini Development Trust (LDT) who is also the coordinator of Tilaurakot Nomination Dossier Preparation Committee.Nepali authorities are hopeful about the council’s visit thinking that it will pave the way for the inclusion of the historical site on the World Heritage Sites list. The LDT has been working on beautifying the Tilaurakot area ahead of the visit. The LDT already issued a tender to dismantle its concrete liaison office.“We notified 37 houses of Shivagadh village, which lies in the west from Tilaurakot, to vacate by July 15. They have been provided compensation. The trust also urged 13 other houses in the area to collect their compensation,” said Sanuraj Shakya, the member secretary of the LDT.The federal government acquired around 50 bigha (around 34 hectares) of land in the surrounding area with the purpose of including Tilaurakot on the World Heritage Sites list. The government has already declared around 100 bigha (around 68 hectares) of land around Tilaurakot as a protected monument zone.The Tilaurakot area, which initially spread in 35 bigha (approximately 24 hectares), now spans around 85 bigha (around 58 hectares), with authorities gradually acquiring more land.The authorities have intensified efforts to clear and beautify the area. “We are working tirelessly to impress the International Council on Monuments and Sites mission. We should accomplish the quest started some 29 years ago to enlist Tilaurakot as a World Heritage Site. For this, support from the local unit, provincial government, federal government and the general public is essential,” said Rai.Bhattarai, Nepal’s permanent representative to UNESCO, had formally submitted the nomination document to Lazare Eloundou Assomo, director of World Heritage at the UNESCO in January. The 21-member World Heritage Committee has the authority to decide whether Tilaurakot will be added to the World Heritage Sites list. Five Asian countries—Japan, South Korea, India, Qatar, and Kazakhstan—are the current members of the committee.A team led by Vice-chairman of the Lumbini Development Trust Lharkyal Lama already visited ambassadors of Japan, South Korea, India and Qatar to Nepal and urged them to support Nepal’s bid to enlist Tilaurakot as a World Heritage Site.Tilaurakot is an ancient Shakya capital city where Siddhartha Gautam spent his princely life before he became the Buddha. The excavation project has been continued in Tilaurakot and other monuments in its vicinity since 2013. The excavation led by British archaeologist Robin Coningham of Durham University, UK unearthed various ruins, coins, pottery, and other artefacts, providing scientific evidence of an ancient civilisation dating back to at least 2,800 years. Recent discoveries and scientific dating of these artefacts also indicate that Tilaurakot showed first signs of urbanisation as early as the sixth century BCAt the turn of the fifth century, travelling through South Asia, Chinese monk Faxian had described a flourishing city along what is today the Nepal-India border. Almost two hundred years later, Xuanzang, another Chinese monk and scholar, described seeing a similar flourishing kingdom.Recently, an archaeological survey that has been ongoing since 2013 has unearthed evidence suggesting that the sites described by the two ancient travellers align with what has been buried underground for centuries.During excavations in Tilaurakot in 2015, archaeologists unearthed 494 ancient “punch mark” coins in an earthen pot during the excavation in Tilaurakot in 2015. During an excavation in Tilaurakot in 2015, archaeologists had recovered 494 ancient “punch mark” coins in an earthen pot. And in 2016, archaeologists had found remnants of houses, roads, walls and wells after three years of digging. Similarly, post holes were also found in the area during the earlier excavation.Based on the findings and its historical as well as archaeological significance, Australian heritage expert Duncan Marshall with support from Coningham, Kai Weise, Yukio Nishimura, Yani Joshi and Basanta Bidari, prepared the nomination dossier for Tilaurakot. Marshall had previously prepared the nomination dossier for the Kathmandu Valley.UNESCO enlisted Tilaurakot in its tentative list in 1996. Since then, the government and the authorities concerned started collecting evidence, facts and scientific data to establish Tilaurakot as a culturally, historically, and archaeologically significant heritage site. If approved by the World Heritage Committee, Tilaurakot will become Nepal’s fifth World Heritage Site after the Kathmandu Valley, Lumbini, Chitwan National Park and Sagarmatha National Park. \nThe Epidemiology and Disease Control Division says it has been closely monitoring the outbreak of the Zika virus in India, as the spread of the deadly disease is a matter of serious concern in neighbouring Nepal due to multiple risk factors.Currently, Nepal is tackling a dengue outbreak, and the same vectors—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—that spread the dengue virus also spread the Zika virus.“Unrestricted cross-border movements of people from the two countries and the proximity and presence of virus-spreading vectors are the main risk factors,” said Dr Gokarna Dahal, chief of the Vector Control section at the Division. “Some hospitals and laboratories carry out other tests when they get negative reports of patients having dengue-like symptoms.”Zika causes microcephaly, a condition in which babies are born with underdeveloped head and brain damage. It is also linked to Guillain-Barre syndrome, a condition in which the immune system attacks the nerves causing muscle weakness and sometimes paralysis.Last week, India reported three cases of zike infection in Maharashtra state. Since 2016, India has witnessed Zika outbreaks every year except in 2019 and 2020.A risk assessment survey carried out in 2018 with the technical and financial support of the World Health Organisation showed that Nepal was a high-risk country for dengue and Zika outbreaks.Dengue-spreading mosquitoes—Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus—also transmit Zika and Chikungunya viruses, which means the vectors are present throughout the country.Doctors say all that is needed for an outbreak is a Zika-infected person, which could be anyone. Outbreaks of the disease in India every year and global movement of the people have increased the risk of an outbreak in our country too, according to them.The Ministry of Health and Population had carried out Zika surveillance in the past and tested samples of people having dengue-like symptoms, but the results came back negative, according to Dahal. The World Health Organisation Nepal had provided financial as well as technical support to acquire the technology to carry out the testing of the viruses, officials said.Doctors say Zika virus symptoms match those of the dengue virus—mild fever, rashes, muscle pain, headache, red eyes and a general feeling of discomfort in up to 80 percent of cases.Studies show that pregnant women and their foetuses are at high risk of Zika infection, as the virus causes microcephaly in the foetus.Zika virus was first identified in Uganda in 1947 in monkeys, according to the UN health agency. It was later detected in humans. Brazil saw the worst outbreak of the virus in 2015 and it has since then spread to 24 other countries. The WHO had declared Zika outbreak an international health emergency in 2016.Meanwhile, Nepal has recorded at least 1,268 dengue cases since January this year. Of the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. \nIn the Secondary Education Examinations (SEE) conducted this year, over 52 percent of students failed to graduate to grade 11. The National Examination Board had enforced the ‘non-graded’ category from this year. The underperformance of the majority of school students has stirred a fresh debate about the test system. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with former National Planning Commission member Usha Jha, who led the committee that recommended the government to adopt the letter grading system.How do you analyse the SEE results published on Thursday?People have reacted to it with shock, not me. In fact, on the basis of the teaching system that is being practised in our schools, I think the results are good. We get the results based on what and how we teach students. Over 52 percent of students have been categorised as non-graded. We need to identify and address the causes behind the bad results. I have heard some people blame the letter grading system. This is wrong. A form of letter grading system was already there. We only suggested an upgraded form of the system. If we start blaming the system, we won’t find the real cause of the problem. What may be the real causes that you are hinting at?The first is the poor quality of teachers in our country. A form of letter grading system was there even before. But it had two loopholes. First, the government took an approach whereby all students would pass. That gave an impression to the students that they don’t need to study hard. That degraded the quality of their education. Second, there was a system of giving marks based on the students’ performances in theoretical and practical exams. Of the total 100 marks, the practical exams made up 35 marks. Most students were given maximum marks in the practical exams. That helped them get higher grades even if they didn’t do well in theoretical exams. This system encouraged students to neglect theoretical studies. That has caused huge damage to our education system. The letter grade system introduced this year has closed those loopholes. But the letter grading system requires a learning environment. The system was introduced without adequate preparation for its effective implementation. Also, the Covid pandemic disturbed preparatory works at the time. We should have drastically improved classroom teaching practices, and trained teachers across the country because their teaching methods are outdated. They weren’t trained on the grading system. They give lectures and encourage students to memorise while the letter grading system requires a thorough process and encourages result-oriented learning. It doesn’t prioritise marks. Our teachers and schools lacked the capacity to implement the new system. Teachers weren’t trained and prepared. Even now, most teachers don’t know what the letter grading system is. The system is necessary to make our students compete in global markets.While we upgraded the system, we didn’t upgrade the schools and teachers. Our teachers engage only in routine and formal responsibilities such as completing textbook courses before the examinations. This system should be properly internalised not only by teachers and students but also school management, palikas [local units] and parents of the students. Only then can it be effectively implemented. These are the major reasons behind the poor results. How is the students’ performance evaluated in the letter grading system?First, teachers should study a lot. They take reference of the subject matter from the textbook and teach students giving a broader perspective of the matter. They have to engage the students practically on the issue. The students should be regularly evaluated based on their participation and response in study and activities. The teachers should teach them and constantly monitor whether they are learning and making progress. The marking should be based on that. So, in this system, the examination starts from day 1 and everyday activities contribute to their marks. It also takes other activities such as behaviour, understanding, presentation into consideration. Therefore, it is called a regular assessment system based on a thorough process, unlike the traditional three-hour-long yearly examination method. If the teachers aren’t competent to carry out these activities, this idea can’t yield good results. They badly need capacity enhancement. The pedagogy should be remodelled.What was the rationale behind the decision to implement this system?One reason was to upgrade our education’s standard on par with the international standards and make our students fit for global markets. In the course of formulating this policy, we undertook a comprehensive research of international practices. Based on that evidence-based research, we submitted a report to then education minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel. The government studied and endorsed it. Basically, this system was introduced with an objective of upgrading our education system in the changed context. But we lacked preparations to implement this idea.We will make a mistake if we change this system. I heard that the education minister [Sumana Shrestha] decided to make some changes in the policy and allow all non-graded students to sit for chance examinations, whereas the system says only those students who secured non-grades in two subjects can retake exams for the same subjects. There is no point in changing the method to favour even the students who have failed in all the subjects. She should have made it clear what factors made her change the criteria overnight. I cannot understand why the minister made the decision in a haste without considering its impact.In fact, our next step should have been capacity enhancement of teachers. The minister took some right decisions such as separating teachers from political parties. But an incumbent minister changing a system that was implemented by a previous minister would cause a problem. She could have formed a panel to conduct a study to find if the letter grading system is the main cause behind the students’ underperformance. But changing a policy through an order didn’t look good.Results show our students are very poor in mathematics, science and English. What could be the reasons?This is unfortunate. We saw similar trends in previous years as well. Mathematics and science are becoming more challenging. One reason is the lack of sufficient teachers for these subjects. Also, some teachers are under-utilised. Some teachers don’t go to the schools. So special measures need to be taken to manage teachers mainly for these subjects. Otherwise, we will have similar results in the coming years.The committee under your leadership recommended that those getting a GPA below 1.6 have to choose technical courses and those willing to study Grade 11 must score above 1.6 GPA. What was the idea behind that recommendation?The idea was to end the situation of halting students’ study and activities because of their lower grades. We have a government body in the form of the Council for Technical Education and Vocational Training (CTEVT) which has been offering dozens of vocational training based on the needs and interests of people. So our youths can join a suitable CTEVT course. We need more people in vocational fields. Skilled people aren’t available in the country. A large number of people working in technical fields in Nepal are from India. We included the provision in consultation with CTEVT officials. Minister Giriraj Mani Pokharel had also prepared a broad plan to implement the letter grading system and integrate the vocational part in our education system. The present government should improve the education system by enhancing teachers’ capacity and encouraging youths to join vocational training to fill the gaps in the employment market. Are the infrastructure and resources available in our education system sufficient to implement the grading system?Some schools lack even essential resources while in some we find misuse or underuse of resources. So, our education ministry should carry out a comprehensive mapping and find where teachers are required, where they are underutilised and where they are idle. Then, the government can make optimum use of the teachers and make additional investment on need-basis. Such an approach will yield better results. In general, our academic institutions lack resources as there is a trend of allocating insufficient budgets for the education sector. Yes, the letter grading system needs more investment. We have to work on teachers’ capacity enhancement and to provide learning materials to students. When you make an activity participatory, you certainly need resources and investments.Do we need to review our teacher recruitment process and our pedagogy in the universities that produce teachers?The government can consider new requirements while recruiting teachers and train them accordingly. Also, we need to update our curriculum and pedagogy for courses such as BEd and MEd to produce quality teachers. I have doubts about the quality of our graduates, post-graduates and even PhD holders due to the poor teaching and learning environment of our academic institutions. There is a need for more coordination and collaboration between the government and universities to address such issues.In the end, I want to stress that the government should adopt a clear and consistent policy and avoid ad-hoc decisions. The letter grading system is the best and we should push for that despite the challenges in its implementation. Just that it should have been enforced after enhancing teachers’ capacity. The problems we have now are due to lack of preparation. \nNepal is nominally a federal country being ruled by political leaders and bureaucrats who are still wedded to their old unitary habits. The centre tightly controls and shapes the political structures of provinces. When there is a political ruction in Kathmandu, its tremors shake all seven provinces. This would not have been the case had the provinces been allowed to operate with a high level of autonomy as envisioned by the new constitution. Right now, the provinces cannot even undertake the basic duty of maintenance of law and order. Schedule 6 of the constitution outlines 21 exclusive authorities of the provincial governments, with maintenance of law and order being at the top of the list. Yet the provinces are yet to get their own police forces, which is in contravention of Article 268 (2) of the national charter. The legislation for the adjustment of the Nepal Police personnel was passed way back in 2019. But the actual process has never gotten underway. The reluctant federalists at the centre—including the top leaders of most political parties—are to be blamed for this. Yet they are not alone in being hesitant on the much-needed change. There is disquiet even among police personnel about the new legislation. The Police Personnel Adjustment Act, for instance, authorises the federal government to assign a deputy inspector general of Nepal Police to serve as province police chief. Such officers can be transferred to other provinces or departments of Nepal Police. But in the case of other lower-ranking officers deputed to the provinces, they can then be transferred only within the police units of the respective province. The police force—already rocked by a drastic decline in the interest of youngsters to fill its vacancies—worries that permanently posting certain officials to certain provinces will jeopardise their career prospects. As such, the interest in joining the force would further wane. The police headquarters has intimated to national leaders and lawmakers that there should be more incentives to lure capable personnel into provinces. If that is what it takes to meet one of the core objectives of the federal system, what is stopping the federal government and the national legislature, both of which are constitutionally bound to implement federalism, from pushing for such a change? The representatives of provincial governments are fed up with the lack of the centre’s interest and are again threatening to hit the streets. The internal affairs ministers of all seven provinces plan to meet Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal to build pressure. This protracted saga of police adjustment is just one reminder of how hard it is to implement federalism so long as the country’s political leadership remains reluctant to empower the provinces and local bodies. Had there been any willingness to do so, the nitty-gritty of the relevant legislation could have been worked out. Most police personnel are not refusing to be posted in provinces. They are only asking for the right incentives. In order to make the federal system work, ways must be found to bridge the troubling mismatch between the expectations of employees of vital institutions and the incentives on offer.  \nDuring my recent visit to Bajura District, I explored olive farming and witnessed its current state in the region. My interaction with Janesh Bhandari, a local civic campaigner, revealed the unfortunate stagnation of a once-promising project. Funded by the Italian government with approximately 1.4 million Euros allocated for Kathmandu, Dolpa and Bajura, this project saw half of the funds directed to Bajura alone. Preliminary research identified that out of 28 species planted, 24 bore fruit, and 10 were recommended for Nepal.Following the success of the pilot study, the Government of Nepal (GoN) has designated Bajura, encompassing the municipalities of Jagannath, Himali, Swamikartik and Budhinanda, as an olive zone. In 2016, an Olive Zone Implementation Unit was established under the Prime Minister Agriculture Modernisation (2015-25) Project. The main goal of this unit is to promote commercial olive farming and enhance the management and utilisation of natural olive forests to increase farmers’ incomes. Despite such significant investment in research, commercial olive farming remains unfruitful, owing to several challenges.ProspectsEmpirical evidence suggests that olive farming in Bajura could serve as a nature-based solution to diversify the local production system. Investing in both wild and domesticated olives could boost household incomes and generate employment in the region. Given the environmental, social and economic benefits, olive cultivation could enhance the resilience and well-being of smallholding farmers. Research also highlights olive as a crop with a high potential for income, employment opportunities and improvement in economic status.Olive oil is a common product in Nepal, but olive wood handicrafts are globally popular. Handicraft items from olive wood fetch high prices, including wooden bowls and plates, which sell at a range of $20-70. Olive oil is also used in producing soaps, scents, skincare and other cosmetics. Nepal imported olive products worth $616,217 in 2022, which shows a year-on-year value growth of 70.38 percent. With olive oil prices in the Nepali market ranging from Rs2,000 to 3,000 per litre, the market potential for olive oil and its diversified products is substantial, making systematic cultivation a promising avenue for import substitution. The Prime Minister's Agriculture Modernisation Project has initiated a programme to construct infrastructure for olive farming and provide relief of Rs427,000 for 2,386 farmers in Bajura.ChallengesDespite Bajura being designated as an olive production zone, several challenges hinder the commercial farming of olives. One major issue is the underutilisation of wild olives due to the lack of collection and processing centres. In addition to these, another challenge was the lack of a three-phase electricity line essential for the production centre's operation, rendering the plant dysfunctional at the moment.Additionally, there is a significant mindset barrier among farmers and local people. Olive trees take five years to bear fruit, and most farmers attracted to faster-yielding crops like apples are reluctant to invest in olive cultivation. The farmers’ economic status exacerbates this reluctance, as they cannot afford to wait for such a long harvest period.Another challenge is the lack of a technically skilled workforce. Some farmers have fallen short of the necessary knowledge about olive cultivation and its benefits, and others have shifted to high-value crops, abandoning traditional farming practices in the region. Educating them about the economic and health benefits of olive farming could prove beneficial. Policy measuresNepal can draw inspiration from Rajasthan, India, where the government actively promoted olive cultivation by introducing Israeli technology and operational models. The Government of India included olives under the national mission on oilseeds and oil palm. After eight years of nurturing olive saplings, this led to the successful launch of Rajasthan's first indigenous olive oil brand. Similarly, Pakistan has seen impressive success in olive farming. In 2022, the country exported virgin and extra virgin olive oil worth $1.9 million. This achievement was enabled by a project launched in 2012 by the Pakistani government, in cooperation with the Italian government, called \"Promotion of Olive Cultivation for Economic Development and Poverty Alleviation\". This project, run through the Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC), has provided Pakistani farmers with training on pruning techniques and technological support. As a result, Italy and Pakistan now enjoy an annual trade relationship worth €2 billion.With the government initiating an olive zone, it is now crucial for local authorities to take ownership of the project and explore the commercial viability of olive oil extraction. Currently, only a few informed individuals at the policy level are aware of the prospects. Disseminating information to local farmers and communities is imperative, as olive is not a part of Nepal's traditional lifestyle and food habits. The government should implement policy measures such as incorporating olive farming into the curriculum of universities and schools. Agricultural universities should encourage students to intern in olive farming regions for practical experience.Once commercial farming is established, Nepal should register with the International Olive Council to gain wider recognition. Agricultural documents should highlight olives as prospective crops, and proper national records should be maintained on the status of wild and commercially farmed olives. Additionally, it is essential to have trained technicians and experts to oversee olive cultivation and farming. With coordinated action from the government, local officials, farmers and other key stakeholders, olive cultivation could become a lucrative endeavour in Nepal. This could help diversify the country's agriculture sector and foster economic development. \nAs temperatures rise, cities across the globe face the threat of extreme heat. Between 2002 and 2010, Nepal had more than two dozen destructive heatwaves, with the most severe occurring in 2009 and 2010, leading to 25 deaths and affecting 280 individuals. Alarmingly, about 80 percent of Nepal’s population is at risk from natural and climate-induced hazards like heat waves.Cities suffer more from heat waves for a few reasons. First is the urban heat island effect, where cities get hotter than villages. This happens because cities are cramped with people, buildings and infrastructure that absorb and retain heat. So, urban centres remain hot even at night when things should cool down, creating a hot bubble over the city that is several degrees warmer than outside. In particular, Kathmandu’s built-up area is almost four times what it was in the mid-1980s. Also, everything we do in cities, like running air conditioners, driving vehicles, working in factories and doing industrial activities, creates even more heat.Additionally, urban centres lack trees or open water bodies to cool things down naturally. This puts city dwellers, especially older people and those with health issues or limited resources, at risk. Addressing these challenges requires innovative urban planning and integrated green infrastructure.Growing threatNepal is witnessing a rise in both the frequency and intensity of heat waves, particularly in cities. The Ministry of Health and Population recently urged the public to take preventive measures against heat waves. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reports that the impact of heat waves became more severe in 2023, making life increasingly difficult. A study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Government of Nepal, 2017 showed that Nepal’s average maximum temperature has risen by 0.056 degrees Celsius, with most places getting hotter yearly.Heat is causing major problems, especially for the poor and underprivileged. High temperatures contribute to drought, forest fires and floods, posing serious threats to human health, lives and the nation’s economy. For instance, on April 19, 2023, there were more than 2,800 forest fires in Nepal in a single day. Following the massive forest fire across the country, Kathmandu became one of the world's most polluted cities, according to the Air Quality Index. Also, this year, over 4,500 wildfires have been reported in the country, almost double last year's, mostly because it’s getting hotter. These heatwaves don’t just hurt people right away. Being out in the heat for a long time can cause serious health problems and chronic conditions, such as cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Feeling tired, dizzy, thirsty, headaches, leg cramps, muscle pain, vomiting, dizziness and fainting are immediate signs of too much exposure to excessive heat. Heat-related severe illnesses like heat stroke need immediate medical attention, and this puts more pressure on healthcare systems. The economic cost is significant, too, with damage to infrastructure, reduced productivity and increased energy demands for cooling.Recent findingsA recent study in the Theoretical and Applied Climatology journal examines the spatiotemporal characterisation of heatwaves in Kathmandu. It develops a methodological framework and suggests ways to lessen the heat impacts. Utilising satellite-based data, essential for developing countries like Nepal where adequate measuring stations are lacking, the study shows that higher temperatures are concentrated in valleys with high population densities. It is high time we took appropriate mitigation measures in urban planning, building infrastructure and at the household and community levels. The study also highlights a notable rise in extreme heatwave conditions, especially from 2012 onwards. A significant urban warming trend, primarily observed in densely populated regions, suggests that the elderly and youth with limited capacities are highly vulnerable to extreme heat. Mitigation strategiesCities need to plan better and include more green spaces to deal with the growing risk of heatwaves. We must figure out how much cooler and to what spatial extent parks, ponds and forests serve effectively. By optimising the design, distribution and maintenance of green infrastructure, cities can use nature to cool things down and make cities resilient. Parks and gardens don’t just provide shade; they also cool things by letting water evaporate from plants and water bodies. Another strategy involves using appropriate construction materials, such as cool roofs and pavements. Vegetation-covered green roofs can also help keep buildings cooler.Policy implicationsPolicies encouraging the adoption of green infrastructure, regulations on urban heat management and incentives for buildings using cool roofing materials can make a significant difference. Public awareness campaigns are also crucial. We must teach everyone about why green infrastructure is good and ways to stay safe in the heat, like drinking enough water and not toiling too much outside when it is super hot.The escalating threat of heatwaves in Nepal’s cities demands immediate and innovative action. Integrating green spaces, water bodies, and other natural elements into urban design is not just an option anymore—we must make cities good places for the next generation to live. The future of city life in a warming world depends on our ability to innovate and adapt. It is high time to make our cities that withstand the challenges of climate change and be great places to live. It’s a job for everyone—governments, city planners and people from all walks of life—to work together to make cities cooler. \nNepal’s Finance Minister, Barsha Man Pun, on May 28 unveiled a budget estimate of Rs1.86 trillion for the fiscal year 2024-25, followed by similar announcements from finance ministers of the seven provinces on June 15. However, many Nepalis feel their government is indifferent to household struggles to secure enough food, leading some to seek better opportunities abroad. There is a growing concern that the budget formulation process and fund allocation lack public participation, which raises questions about transparency and democratic accountability. This sentiment, particularly resonant among the youth, underscores broader global discontent with governance decisions that affect citizens’ lives. As cities and municipalities worldwide explore diverse approaches to address these issues, Nepal must shed its 18th-century mindset and take proactive steps.Participatory budgetingA wave of participatory policy reforms has emerged worldwide, offering remedies to make democracy more functional and inclusive. Facilitated by advancements in internet and smartphone technology, as well as democratic experimentation, these reforms aim to rejuvenate democracy by fostering inclusive governance and civic engagement. At the forefront of these efforts is participatory budgeting, empowering citizens to identify community needs, collaborate with elected officials to formulate budget proposals and vote on the allocation of public funds.Such budgeting represents democratic governance and captures widespread attention for its transformative potential in enhancing citizen engagement and advancing social justice within public finance. It has evolved into a global phenomenon, catalysing democratic decision-making processes surrounding the allocation of public funds within local communities.Participatory budgeting embodies fundamental principles of deliberative democracy, social equity and citizen empowerment. It represents a departure from conventional top-down approaches to budgeting, advocating for the active involvement of citizens in shaping spending priorities and resource allocations. By facilitating direct citizen engagement in budgetary decision-making processes, participatory budgeting challenges traditional notions of representative democracy, fostering a more inclusive and participatory form of governance similar to the future of democracy: Direct democracy.The process typically unfolds through structured stages, encompassing information dissemination, idea generation, deliberation, voting and implementation. These stages are characterised by a commitment to inclusivity, transparency and accountability, ensuring that diverse voices are heard, decisions are made through informed deliberation, and outcomes are responsive to community needs and preferences. As exemplified by the experiences of various communities worldwide, participatory budgeting initiatives engender a sense of civic ownership, social cohesion and trust in government among participants, fostering a culture of active citizenship and collective responsibility.Practicing countriesMany progressive capital cities from the developed world, notably Seoul and Paris, have distinguished themselves by implementing participatory budgeting initiatives. In Paris, the initiative began in 2014, enabling residents to propose and vote on projects to enhance their neighbourhoods. Through digital platforms and public gatherings, Parisians allocated millions of euros toward community gardens, cycle lanes and cultural events, breathing new life into urban spaces and fostering heightened civic engagement.Similarly, Seoul's participatory budgeting initiative, \"Democracy Seoul,\" launched in 2012, stands as the first programme of its kind in a city with a population exceeding 10 million. Leveraging online platforms and face-to-face meetings, Seoul’s citizens collectively prioritise projects ranging from public infrastructure to welfare services and cultural initiatives. This bottom-up approach cultivates a sense of community ownership and collaboration, enriching the democratic fabric of governance.Participatory budgeting has proven successful even in developing countries with limited internet access. Its introduction in the early 2000s marked a significant shift toward citizen-led decision-making in La Paz, Bolivia. Through neighbourhood assemblies and public gatherings, residents actively prioritise projects, ranging from crucial infrastructure improvements to vital social programmes, focusing on marginalised communities' needs. Nepal's municipalities would benefit from similar participatory budgeting initiatives.India has emerged as a regional leader in participatory budgeting initiatives. Kerala pioneered this approach in 1996, empowering citizens in village meetings to determine 40 percent of state revenues under the Kerala People’s Campaign. From education to agriculture, Kerala embodies grassroots democracy and community empowerment. Progressive Indian cities, starting with Bengaluru in 2001, have embraced participatory budgeting, involving resident associations in municipal budgets. Pune successfully implemented participatory budgeting in 2005, annually inviting citizen proposals and enhancing local governance through elected representatives. Citizens have a month to submit their proposals by filling out the ‘Citizen Suggestion Form’, available online and at the ward office.Participatory budgeting indeed highlights inclusive approaches crucial for responsive democratic societies. While indicative of progress, it must evolve beyond outdated paradigms. A contemporary fiscal framework is essential, enabling direct citizen influence on tax allocation through digital innovations. Taxpayers should oversee fund deployment, scrutinising budget proposals from political entities, governmental bodies, or AI-driven financial structures to ensure public resources align with stakeholders’ priorities. The era of unilateral decisions by political parties, especially ministers and bureaucrats, particularly within the Ministry of Finance, regarding taxpayer capital is swiftly ending. This shift toward semi-direct democracy paves the path for genuine direct democracy, fostering a more engaged and participatory future.  \nPresident Joe Biden's train-wreck debate with Republican opponent Donald Trump followed a series of decisions by his most senior advisers that critics now point to as wrong-headed, interviews with Democratic allies, donors and former and current aides show.Trump, 78, repeated a series of well-worn, glaring falsehoods during the 90-minute debate on Thursday, including claims that he actually won the 2020 election.Biden, 81, failed to refute them and his fumbling, halting performance has sparked calls from Democrats for him to end his quest for a second term and for \"soul-searching\" or resignations among top aides.\"My only request was make sure he's rested before the debate, but he was exhausted. He was unwell,\" said one person who said they appealed to Biden's top aides in the days before, to no avail. \"What a bad decision to send him out looking sick and exhausted.\"Others were even more pointed.\"It is my belief that he was over-coached, over-practiced. And I believe [senior aide] Anita Dunn... put him in a venue that was conducive for Trump and not for him,” said John Morgan, a Florida-based attorney and major Biden fundraiser.Morgan said Dunn and her husband, Bob Bauer, the president’s attorney who played Trump in pre-debate rehearsals, should \"be fired forever and never let back anywhere near the campaign.\"Biden's debate strategy was signed off on by campaign chair Jen O'Malley Dillon, who helped him win in 2020 and was appointed in January to boost an uneven reelection campaign. Dunn, a longtime Biden aide and former Barack Obama campaign strategist, backed that strategy.Confidence going into the event was high. Trump was convicted of falsifying documents by a jury in New York on May 31, while Biden held back-to-back visits in Europe.To the surprise of some Biden aides, his stubbornly low poll numbers began to inch up nationally in the weeks that followed.Advisers set up a rigorous debate prep calendar, with Biden sequestered at Camp David for six days.An inner circle, some close to Biden for decades, were involved: Ron Klain, his first White House chief of staff, Dunn, former White House counsel and long-time adviser Mike Donilon, as well as about a dozen other policy and political experts.Biden's campaign said on Friday that no staff shake-up was under consideration. Multiple aides, not just Dunn and Bauer, were involved in the preparation, said a campaign official, who also noted that Morgan was not there.In an email to supporters Saturday, O'Malley Dillon said internal polls and focus groups showed no change in voters' opinions in battleground states after the debate. She warned \"overblown media narratives\" may drive \"temporary dips in the polls,\" but said she was confident Biden would win in November.Biden's trips abroad, especially to France earlier this month, generated Republican social media clips poking fun at his age but, his team believed, it also showed him as a strong leader on an international stage.White House aides who traveled with the president were in a good mood as he headed to Camp David on June 21. They believed Biden was going into the debate with the most precious political asset: momentum, the wind at his back.Biden had flown to France, back to the United States, to Italy, and to the West Coast, among other travels, over a 14-day period before taking just a few days to rest at his vacation home in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware.He was dragging, according to several people who observed him during this period.As Biden and his aides settled in at Camp David six days before the debate, aides figured he had a lot to accomplish, more than his opponent. Trump could just complain about the present administration - and Biden would need the facts and some zingers at his fingertips.They expected Trump would be far more disciplined and prepared than he had been in 2020 and believed that they would need to counter a string of rapid-fire lies.In lengthy prep sessions, they peppered Biden with details, then followed them up with mock debates.Critics say now that the preparation should have focused on the bigger vision he needs to sell to the country, and that Biden had insufficient rest headed into the debate.Run down, Biden would also catch a small cold, White House aides said, as he has regularly during his term after long stretches of time zone-bending work.The result, critics say, was candidate Biden at his worst: He appeared on stage with his face wan, his hair straggly at his collar and his voice hoarse. He was frequently incoherent.\"I've never seen him perform that way before,\" said Michael LaRosa, former special assistant to President Biden and press secretary for first lady Jill Biden.\"He can run circles around most people on matters of complex policy,\" LaRosa said. \"This was always going to be a matter of presentation and cosmetics, and superficial judgments that were going to be made about his performance. And he wasn't able to clear the bar.\"Earlier this year, some Biden aides discussed whether he should debate Trump at all, arguing that it could give Trump a broad public platform that would disadvantage Biden.Then Biden himself, in an April interview with shock jock Howard Stern, delivered a decision on debating Trump that was a surprise to some advisers. \"I am, somewhere,\" he said.The triumphant memory of his State of the Union address in March fresh in their minds, Biden's team geared up to debate but took radical steps to control the terms.They decided to reject three long-scheduled presidential debates in September and October organised by the Commission on Presidential Debates, still smarting over the group's handling of the 2020 debates.Trump repeatedly violated the rules of what would be a chaotic first debate in 2020, showing up despite having tested positive for COVID-19, and talking over Biden relentlessly.His team tried to set the contest on their own terms, with what they saw as a more pliant host in CNN. No audience cheering Trump's invective. Networks and moderators inclined to challenge Trump. No Robert F. Kennedy Jr. A mute button.The day after the debate, Biden bounced back with a forceful speech in North Carolina, and a pledge to keep going. Many donors and Democrats are rallying around him.But the damage has been done.Asked on Sunday whether the Democratic Party was discussing a new 2024 candidate, Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin told MSNBC: \"There are very honest and serious and rigorous conversations taking place at every level of our party, because it is a political party and we have differences in point of view.\"Raskin added: \"Whether he's the candidate or someone else is the candidate, he's going to be the keynote speaker at our convention.\" \nEcuador secured a place in the Copa America quarter-finals on Sunday after grinding out a 0-0 draw with Mexico, who bowed out of the tournament after finishing third in Group B.Ecuador, who are looking to reach their first semi-final since hosting the event in 1993, face defending champions Argentina in the quarters, while group winners Venezuela, who beat Jamaica 3-0, take on Canada.Ecuador finished level with Mexico on four points but progress to the last eight thanks to a superior goal difference.In a physical first half, Mexico attacked with real intensity as they sought the win they needed but lacked quality on the ball and failed to record a shot on target.Lozano’s side continued to push after the break and full-back Gerardo Arteaga created a good opportunity after a powerful run into the box, before being denied by a last-ditch tackle from Felix Torres.Winger Julian Quinones tested Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez with a long-range effort in the 65th minute. Dominguez kept out Quinones’ shot with a diving save, with Mexico’s Santi Gimenez blasting the rebound off the post from a tight angle.As Mexico threw bodies forward in their search for a winner, Ecuador increasingly posed a threat on the counter-attack and in the 68th minute Enner Valencia forced a save from Julio Gonzalez with a dipping strike.Mexico were then awarded a penalty in the seventh minute of stoppage time when Torres appeared to bring down Guillermo Martinez but the decision was overturned after a VAR review.“We would like to have a little bit more control,” Ecuador coach Felix Sanchez told reporters.“It’s a very young squad, as I said, and we actually need to be able to overcome these situations in these matches. We know that even if you obtain the results you want, you need to be self-critical and continue improving.”Mexico manager Jaime Lozano is likely to face increased scrutiny after they scored just one goal in their three group matches. \nThe weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy on Monday. Light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is expected in some parts of the country, while chances of heavy rainfall are susceptible in a few places in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudur Pashchim Provinces.The Meteorological Forecasting Division has issued warnings for very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Koshi Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province.The weather is expected to stay partly to mostly cloudy till the end of the day.Tonight, light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning is in some parts of Koshi Province, Madhesh Province, Bagmati Province, and Gandaki Province. There’s also a possibility of heavy rainfall in a few areas of these provinces.Meanwhile, a special bulletin has been issued by the Met Office warning of extremely heavy rainfall at one or two locations in Koshi Province and Gandaki Province tonight.Dhangadi’s maximum temperature was recorded at 35.3 degrees Celsius, while the minimum temperature in Jomsom was 14.5 degrees Celsius. \nAs the monsoon gains traction, the price of vegetables has soared drastically in the Kathmandu valley, pushing up kitchen costs.Daily essentials like ginger, green chillies, tomatoes and potatoes are becoming prohibitively expensive for ordinary people.Traders say that production dropped due to low rainfall during the pre-monsoon (March-May) period. And with heavy rainfall in the last few weeks, floods and landslides have disrupted the supply chain. Before spring, the winter drought also reduced the output, vegetable traders say. Vegetable prices have gone up steadily in the past few months. According to the macroeconomic report of Nepal Rastra Bank, the country’s central bank, vegetable prices, as measured by the consumer price index, were up 23.11 percent in mid-May.Tomatoes, potatoes, onions, cauliflower, cowpeas, French beans, bitter gourd, smooth gourd, squash, okara, leafy vegetables, button mushrooms, broccoli, lime, chilli green, capsicum, and cucumbers became pricier within a month.Binay Shrestha, information officer at the Kalimati Fruits and Vegetable Market Development Board, the country’s largest vegetable trading centre, said supply of home-grown vegetables had dwindled right from the winter. The shortfall is met with imports, mainly from India.As soon as the monsoon started, flooding and landslides affected the supply system, sending prices high, he added.And there are no signs of the prices falling. “Naturally, vegetable prices rise during the monsoon as rainfall impacts output and supply.”Shrestha said the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market is receiving vegetables in smaller volumes these days. Before the monsoon the market received 700 tonnes of vegetables daily, but it has now dropped to 500 tonnes.The monsoon season in Nepal generally begins on June 13 and ends on October 2. This year, the phenomenon entered Nepal from the southwest on June 10, three days ahead of the usual onset date.The comparative supply figure shows that the daily vegetable arrival in the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market declined 7 percent within a month.Tomato, potato, and onion prices have seen a significant fluctuation.The average wholesale price of tomato big (Nepali) has increased by 36.36 percent to Rs75 per kg within a month. However, the price of small tomatoes produced in plastic tunnels has declined by 42.17 percent to Rs22.67.Shrestha said tomato prices in the summer fall due to increased production as tunnel farming is not affected by rains, and new farming systems have flourished.On June 18 last year, farmers threw around 90 tonnes of tomatoes on the road outside the Kalimati fruits and vegetable market to vent their anger at the low prices they were getting. The price of tomato big (Nepali) had plummeted to Rs35 per kg.Shrestha expected that the tomato price would not dip any lower.The wholesale price of potato (Indian) increased by 9.94 percent to Rs51.67 per kg.The price of Mude potato, produced in summer in high-altitude places like Mude of Sindhupalchok, increased by 4.08 percent to Rs51 per kg. The average wholesale price of onion (dry) increased by 47.09 percent to Rs97.67 per kg within a month. Vegetable traders said that onion prices have increased due to the Indian export tax policy.In May, India lifted the ban on onion export after nearly five months but imposed a minimum export price of $550 per tonne.The price of cauliflower also increased by 72.73 percent to Rs95 per kg during the review period. The price of cowpea (short) increased by 23.91 percent to Rs95 per kg, and the price of French bean (local) increased by 25 percent to Rs65 per kg.Bitter gourd now costs Rs45 per kg, rising by 28.57 percent within a month.Smooth gourd price sharply increased by 57.14 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of squash round jumped 40 percent to Rs35 per kg within a month, while the price of okara shot up by 154.63 percent to Rs55 per kg.The price of mustard greens rose 106.22 percent to Rs55 per kg, and mustard leaf rose by 55.56 percent to Rs35 per kg.Button mushroom prices increased by 5.56 percent to Rs316.67 per kg.Even in its season, cucumber price has increased significantly. The price of cucumber (local) increased by 58.33 percent to Rs95 per kg while that of hybrid cucumber rose by 80 percent to Rs45 per kg.The price of capsicum increased by 2.27 percent to Rs45 per kg, while the cost of green chilli increased by 25 percent to Rs95 per kg. \nStylish Spain recovered from the shock of conceding an early own goal to eventually overrun a tireless and spirited Georgia 4-1 on Sunday and surge into a mouth-watering Euro 2024 quarter-final with Germany.After withstanding a near-constant early assault, with outstanding keeper Giorgi Mamardashvili making several good saves, Georgia stunned the crowd by taking the lead with their first attack after 18 minutes when Otar Kakabadze’s fizzing cross was diverted into his own net by the chest of Spain’s Robin Le Normand.The Spaniards levelled the last-16 contest through Rodri from the edge of the box in the 39th minute and, after Khvicha Kvaratskhelia almost scored a stunning second from near the halfway line for the tournament outsiders, Fabian Ruiz headed Spain ahead six minutes into the second half.Spain continued to press and probe but the Georgians ran themselves ragged to keep them at bay until Nico Williams finally broke clear to slam in the third in the 75th minute, with Dani Olmo neatly tucking home the fourth goal seven minutes from time to secure their fourth win of the tournament.Spain were mostly cool and confident, barely ruffled by the determination of the Georgians, with youngsters Williams and Lamine Yamal quick, inventive and unrelenting down the flanks.“Against Germany we have to be at our best,” said player of the match Rodri. “We knew it was going to be a tough match. They put us in trouble. We had chances.“It was a pity about the goal, but we showed character and pride to come back. We knew they were going to be a solid team.” \nThe Nepal Oil Corporation has increased petrol and diesel prices with effect from Sunday midnight.The state-owned monopoly hiked the petrol price by Rs2 per litre and diesel and kerosene by Rs5 per litre.Consumers now have to pay Rs167 per litre for petrol in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.They have to pay Rs166 for a litre of petrol in Surkhet and Dang and Rs164.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj.Likewise, a litre of diesel and kerosene will now cost Rs157 in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal; Rs156 in Surkhet and Dang; and Rs154.50 in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj. \nThe parliamentary special committee investigating the embezzlement of depositors’ funds by various cooperatives has decided to ask for documents from 20 cooperatives that were declared problematic by the government.According to committee chair Surya Bahadur Thapa, the 7th meeting of the committee held on Sunday decided to correspond to get the necessary documents.“Today’s meeting specifically decided to correspond to request the documents of 20 cooperatives that have been declared problematic. In the sixth meeting, we had already decided to request the documents of the other nine crisis-ridden cooperatives,” said Thapa.The committee meeting held discussions with Radha Krishna Mainali, the coordinator of the task force formed to study cooperatives in 1990, Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the coordinator of the task force formed to study cooperatives in 2004-05, and Gauri Bahadur Karki, the coordinator of the commission formed to investigate problematic cooperatives in 2013.The committee, at its meeting on June 26, had decided to seek documents from cooperatives that transferred funds to Gorkha Media Network.Gitendra Babu (GB) Rai, the chairman of the media house, is accused of embezzling hundreds of millions of rupees in collusion with different cooperatives in Kaski, Chitwan, and Butwal. Rai is currently on the run.After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.As per the committee’s jurisdiction as defined in its terms of reference, the committee will investigate the crisis-ridden cooperatives, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulatory arrangements, supervision and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the problematic cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee.The probe panel was formed after the main opposition Nepali Congress disrupted parliamentary proceedings for over two months demanding such a body be constituted to investigate cooperative scams.The issue got complicated as Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, who is the chair of the Rastriya Swatantra Party, is also accused of misusing the money from various cooperatives. Lamichhane was managing director of Gorkha Media Network before joining politics. \nPolice have arrested former Madhesh provincial assembly member Kaushal Kumar Yadav on the charge of murdering Assistant Sub-Inspector of Police Thaman BK during the Madhesh agitation in 2015.Yadav was produced before the Mahottari District Court on Sunday.Deputy Superintendent of Police Santulal Jayashwar, said Yadav was arrested when he tried to flee following an accident in Pokharbhinda of the district.The court sentenced seven people to life imprisonment in the case, but it kept Yadav’s case on hold. Yadav, former provincial lawmaker of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, is accused of lynching the injured APF officer in Jaleshwar during the Madhesh agitation on September 11, 2015. The suspects, along with Yadav, had allegedly dragged injured officer Thaman BK from an ambulance and killed him while he was being rushed to Janakpur for treatment.Pradeep Sah, Sanjay Kumar Sah, Mohan Thakur, Rama Shankar Mishra, Abhiram Sharma, Surendra Pandey, and Dharmendra Raya were sentenced to life, while the court acquitted federal lawmaker Laxmi Mahato Koiri of the CPN-UML.Among them, Pradeep and Sanjay are serving jail sentences while others are on the run. \nFrench voters headed to the polls on Sunday in the first round of a snap parliamentary election that could usher in the country’s first far-right government since World War Two, a potential sea change at the heart of the European Union.President Emmanuel Macron stunned the country when he called the vote after his centrist alliance was crushed in European elections this month by Marine Le Pen’s National Rally (RN). Her eurosceptic, anti-immigrant party was a longtime pariah but is now closer to power than it has ever been.Polls opened at 0600 GMT and will close at 1600 GMT in small towns and cities, with an 1800 GMT finish in the bigger cities, when the first exit polls for the night and seat projections for the decisive second round a week later are expected.However the electoral system can make it hard to estimate the precise distribution of seats in the 577-seat National Assembly, and the final outcome will not be known until the end of voting on July 7.“We are going to win an absolute majority,” Le Pen said in a newspaper interview on Wednesday, predicting that her protégé, 28-year-old Jordan Bardella, would be prime minister. Her party has a high-spending economic programme and seeks to reduce immigration.A woman screamed “It’s shameful, it’s shameful” as Bardella arrived to cast his vote in Garches near Paris. “They even invited the leftists,” he said.If the RN does win an absolute majority, French diplomacy could be headed for an unprecedented period of turbulence: with Macron - who has said he will continue his presidency until the end of his term in 2027 - and Bardella jostling for the right to speak for France.France has had three periods of “cohabitation” - when the president and government are from opposite political camps - in its post-war history, but none with such radically divergent world views competing at the top of the state.Bardella has already indicated he would challenge Macron on global issues. France could lurch from being a pillar of the EU to a thorn in its side, demanding a rebate of the French contribution to the EU budget, clashing with Brussels over European Commission jobs and reversing Macron’s calls for greater EU unity and assertiveness on defence.A clear RN victory would also bring uncertainty as to where France stands on the Russia-Ukraine war. Le Pen has a history of pro-Russian sentiment and while the party now says it would help Ukraine defend itself against Russian invaders, it has also set out red lines, such as refusing to provide long-range missiles.In Hénin-Beaumont, a town in Le Pen’s constituency in northern France where she may be re-elected in the first round, 67-year-old Denis Ledieu said people were suffering due to the long-term deindustrializaton of the region.“So if the (RN) promises them things, then why not? They want to try it out, I think,” he said.Across France, early turnout figures were higher than in the 2022 legislative vote, at 25.9% by midday, compared with 18.43% two years ago, the interior ministry said.‘Split vote favours RN’Opinion polls have suggested the RN has a comfortable lead of 33%-36% of the popular vote, with a hastily assembled left-wing coalition, the New Popular Front, in second place on 28%-31% and Macron’s centrist alliance in third on 20%-23%.The New Popular Front includes a wide range of parties, from the moderate centre-left to the hard-left, eurosceptic, anti-NATO party France Unbowed, led by one of Macron’s most vitriolic opponents, Jean-Luc Melenchon.How the poll numbers will translate into seats in the National Assembly is hard to predict because of how the election works, said Vincent Martigny, professor of political science at the University of Nice and the Ecole Polytechnique.Candidates can be elected in the first round if they win an absolute majority of votes in their constituency, but that is rare. Most constituencies will need a second round involving all candidates who received votes from at least 12.5% of registered voters in the first round. The top scorer wins.“If you have a very high level of participation you might have a third or fourth party that is getting into the struggle. So then of course there’s a risk of split voting and we know that the split vote favours the National Rally,” Martigny said.For decades, as the far right steadily gained popularity, voters and parties who did not support it would unite against it whenever it edged closer to national power, but that may not hold true this time.Martigny said no one knew whether candidates from Macron’s camp would consider dropping out of the second round to give rivals from the left a chance of beating the RN, or the reverse.Le Pen and Bardella have sought to make their party’s image more acceptable to the mainstream, for example by denouncing antisemitism. Le Pen’s father Jean-Marie Le Pen, founder and long-term leader of the RN’s forerunner, had a history of overtly antisemitic comments.But critics say the RN’s courting of Jews is just a cover allowing it to deny accusations of racism while constantly stigmatising Muslims and foreigners. \nAn employee of the Makalu Barun National Park has been found dead.Keshar Karki, 50, who served as a game scout at the park, was found dead on Sunday in Makalu Rural Municipality-3, according to Deputy Superintendent of Police Ghana Shyam Shrestha.Locals reported to the authorities after finding Karki some distance away from the park office. It is suspected that Karki died after falling off a cliff. The police have launched an investigation into the incident. \nAmbassadorial appointments, mostly after the restoration of democracy in 1990, have not been free from controversy. A kind of instability has been created in Nepali diplomacy as those appointed in political quotas are recalled after every government change. As per the recent practice, half the envoys are political appointees while the rest are recommended from among career diplomats.The June 6 decision of the government to recall envoys from 11 countries and Friday’s selection of new faces has yet again raised the question of how long governments will follow the practice that dents the country’s image and makes the conduct of its foreign policy inconsistent.Former foreign minister Narayan Khadka, who is a leader of the opposition Nepali Congress, argues that if an ambassador does not cooperate and support the government and if someone’s performance is poor, the government can recall them, but they should not be recalled en masse.The Cabinet meeting on Friday recommended ambassadors for eight countries while it has yet to pick envoys for three other countries. According to sources in the Prime Minister’s Office, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs Narayan Kaji Shrestha was under pressure from Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and KP Sharma Oli, the chair of the major coalition partner CPN-UML, to recall the ambassadors and make new recommendations. An official at the PMO said that Shrestha wanted to recall those who have poor performance and to send ambassadors with good profiles and strong careers. “But that wasn’t meant to be and he eventually had to compromise with the prime minister and the UML chair,” the official said.The recommendation of Bijan Pant as ambassador to the United Kingdom was a major bone of contention between Dahal and Shrestha, said the official. Shrestha did not want to send ambassadors who didn’t have prior experience in diplomacy and international relations. The minister also wanted to avoid sending individuals with controversial backgrounds and those who have gotten repeated opportunities in state affairs, according to sources.The low point of Nepali diplomacy was when the government recalled Ambassador Shankar Sharma from India two days before Prime Minister Dahal’s visit to New Delhi to attend the swearing-in ceremony of his Indian counterpart Narendra Modi, said Khadka. “Such decisions are made only by people with zero sense of diplomacy,” he added.Khadka believes that the decision was taken under Oli’s pressure and that the prime minister should at least have avoided recalling the ambassador from India for a few days. The prime minister could have recalled Sharma after he returned from India, he said.“Some ambassadors we picked in 2021 were really good. They deserved continuity but the prime minister, whose own term is uncertain, has decided to recall them,” said Khadka. “This shows the level of our diplomacy, a lack of common sense of our leaders as well as the ugly side of our politics and politicians.”The government on Friday recommended Lokdarshan Regmi, the former chief secretary and Nepal’s ambassador to the United Kingdom, as Nepal’s new envoy to India in place of incumbent ambassador, Sharma. Sharma was appointed under the Nepali Congress quota in 2021 by the Sher Bahadur Deuba government. Similarly, the government has named former commerce and industry secretary Chandra Ghimire Nepal’s new ambassador to the United States. The incumbent, Sridhar Khatri, appointed in the Congress quota in March 2022, has been recalled. Bijan Pant has been named ambassador to the United Kingdom. Pant previously served as a social development adviser to the erstwhile Prime Minister Sushil Koirala, the late Congress leader, and until recently worked as an adviser to the Oxford Poverty and Human Development Initiative (OPHI). However, this time, he was chosen as an envoy by the CPN (Maoist Centre) in the party’s quota. According to a senior Maoist Centre leader, the sudden entry of Pant has sparked discontent in the prime minister’s party.Former member of the National Human Rights Commission, Sushil Pyakurel, has been recommended for South Korea, according to the Cabinet decision. Pyakurel, who also served as an adviser to the second President of the country, Bidya Devi Bhandari, will replace Jyoti Pyakurel Bhandari. Sumnima Tuladhar, a noted child rights activist and Executive Director of Child Workers in Nepal Concerned Centre (CWIN), has been recommended as Nepal's envoy to Denmark.Similarly, Pushpa Raj Rajkarnikar will replace Sharmila Parajuli Dhakal as envoy to Spain. Rajkarnikar is a former member of the National Planning Commission and an expert in trade and financial management.He was picked by the newly formed Ashok Rai-led Janata Samajbadi Party. The new party also got to pick an envoy for Saudi Arabia, whereby it chose to send Abu Sufayan Khan of Kapilbastu district.In Malaysia, Netra Prasad Timilsina, a long-time NGO activist, has been nominated under the UML quota. He replaces Dilli Raj Poudel, who was appointed under the CPN (Unified Socialist) quota.Among others, Pyakurel, Tuladhar and Timilsina have the background of working in the NGO sector. Of the 11 vacant posts, the government on Friday made recommendations for eight countries. Recommendations for Qatar, Israel, and Portugal are pending. Those recommended get appointed only after parliamentary hearing.Ruling partner Rastriya Swatantra Party will have its say in the appointment of two envoys. But party leaders said they are still unclear which country they will get to recommend the envoys for. “We are still clueless about the countries, but we are nonetheless preparing to find envoys for our quotas,” said an RSP leader.A joint-secretary at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs argued how the latest episode has again underscored the need for the appointment of more career diplomats. “Political parties may still appoint ambassadors to countries like India, China, and the US, but we must send career diplomats to destinations other than the three countries,” he said. At present, out of 30 Nepali embassies and three permanent missions, 16 are headed by career diplomats. The career diplomats are leading the Nepali missions in Bahrain, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Egypt, France, Germany, Kuwait, Myanmar, Oman, Pakistan, Thailand, and the United Arab Emirates. All three Nepali permanent missions in New York, Geneva, and Vienna are also led by career diplomats.The joint-secretary said the career diplomat pie should increase from the current 50 percent to 80 or 90 percent, or the instability Nepal currently sees would continue. “The appointment of those with controversial backgrounds and despite their conflict of interest have further eroded Nepal’s image abroad. Unfortunately, this couldn’t be avoided in the appointments this time around as well,” rued the foreign ministry official.After 1990, there was the practice of recalling ambassadors after government change but the frequency of such changes greatly increased after 2006, said Yuba Nath Lamsal, former ambassador to Denmark. “If we properly screen ambassadorial candidates before their nomination and send them only after parliamentary hearing, there is no need to recall them so frequently. After all, they have been vetted in the country and have also gotten the required approval, known as ‘agrément’ in diplomatic terms, from the countries hosting them,” he said.Lamsal stressed the need to stop the frequent chopping and changing of the country’s envoys, in order to boost Nepal’s diplomatic credentials. The government in 2019 also came up with the criteria for ambassadorial appointment, but that was not followed by successive governments. Point 5 of the criteria, a copy of which was obtained by the Post, states: In view of the principle of inclusiveness, national welfare and the state’s representation, an experienced candidate with an excellent academic record and diplomatic capability will be appointed the ambassador.Point 6 further states: ambassadors must be capable and have the experience of Nepal’s foreign policy and international relations, and be informed on the dynamics of bilateral and multilateral diplomacy.Both of these criteria were ignored this time, just like they were in the past. Very few nominees have any kind of diplomatic experience or credentials. They meet only a few criteria such as being above 35 years of age, holding a bachelor’s degree, not having criminal records and not having been convicted of corruption. However, little attention is paid to avoid the conflict of interest and to meet the criteria of experience in international relations and expertise in the field of diplomacy. The criteria also states that ambassadorial appointees should hold “country-specific knowledge”. But hardly any of the nominees have relevant experience—professional or academic—on issues related to their host countries.Lamsal called for making the selection process transparent so that the host country takes Nepal’s ambassador seriously. “No doubt, envoys should be appointed on merit and they should be allowed to work for some time. Changing them frequently only tarnishes the country’s image,” he said. “This corrosive practice must stop.” \nOn March 15 last year, China reopened its borders for travel, ending a three-year closure during the Covid pandemic. As soon as the borders—land and air—opened, and the China-funded international airport in Pokhara was inaugurated, optimism was high. Before the pandemic, market insiders predicted a dramatic surge in Chinese tourists, who were Nepal’s second-largest source market after India before the Covid-19 pandemic. It didn’t happen. Nepal received 60,878 Chinese tourists in 2023, a recovery by a third from the pre-pandemic level when Chinese tourists boomed in Nepal.In the first five months (January–May) of this year, Nepal received 46,671 Chinese, with the highest arrival of 12,093 recorded in March. While Chinese arrivals slowed, Indian tourists boomed in Nepal, reaching an all-time high of 319,936 individuals, according to the Department of Immigration. Among Indians, only those who come by air are counted as tourists in Nepal. In the first five months, Nepal has received 148,861 Indian tourists, the highest number of 38,288 recorded in May. Before the pandemic, India and China were competing neck-to-neck. Now, there is a huge imbalance between the south and north.Will it change? On Monday, during the 16th round of the Nepal-China diplomatic consultation mechanism meeting held in Kathmandu, Beijing made a surprise announcement.It announced plans to promote Nepali tourism in China as part of celebrating 2025 as ‘Visit Nepal Year in China’, which Nepal’s top travel trade entrepreneurs say is a “big statement.” They say they had never before heard China favour any country with such soft power diplomacy.Will 2025 be the year for the potential great return of Chinese tourists then? “So far, I haven’t heard or seen Beijing promote any country’s tourism inside China. This is, in fact, a good gesture of neighbourliness,” said Kishore Raj Pandey, chairman of Saathi Nepal Travel and Tours, who was the first person to bring Chinese tourists to Nepal in 2001.“If it has been announced, Beijing indeed has some policy to encourage Chinese citizens to travel to Nepal.”Tourism is vital for Nepal’s economy. According to the recently released annual World Travel and Tourism Council research report, Nepal’s tourism sector generated Rs327.9 billion ($2.5 billion) in revenue and supported 1.19 million jobs directly and indirectly last year. The report forecasts that Nepal will generate 1.22 million jobs in 2024. Last year, the country received 1 million tourists.Some critics say it’s a lofty promise. Before Monday’s meeting, during the third Nepal Investment Summit held in Kathmandu on April 28, Luo Zhaohui, chairman of the China International Development Cooperation Agency, announced the waiver of visa fees for Nepalis.It was implemented on May 1. There was another announcement, too.“The Chinese government is making arrangements to start new flights from China to Nepal’s two new international airports—Pokhara and Lumbini,” Luo said while addressing the summit.Nepal’s $216 million international airport in Pokhara, the country’s tourism capital, opened in January last year. Beijing financed it.Similarly, Nepal’s second international airport in Bhairahawa, built by Chinese contractors, started operating in May 2022 after four years of construction delays. The objectives of both projects are to decentralise economic activities in the new federal setup, attract more tourists, and prevent Nepalis from going abroad.But only some international flights are operating in the two new shiny airports.“Under Beijing's renewed diplomacy, there is a possibility of the operation of these two new international airports,” said Basant Raj Mishra, a senior tourism entrepreneur. “Once flights from China come, it will create competition.”He said Beijing’s announcement represents a great opportunity for Nepal. “We should be prepared for joint marketing and promotional activities. With a proper policy, we can attract 1 million tourists from China alone in 2025. And for this, we need enhanced flight connectivity.”China is facing many economic obstacles, but Beijing remains optimistic about growth.Reports show that Chinese tourists hit the road in significant numbers during the recent five-day Labor holidays in May but kept a tight grip on their wallets, reflecting still-weak sentiment in the world’s second-largest economy.According to a statement from China’s Ministry of Culture and Tourism, travellers made 28.2 percent more trips, but spending only rose 13.5 percent from the 2019 break. “Of all the countries, China has the largest number of airlines connecting Nepal but brings the lowest number of tourists,” said Vijay Shrestha, vice president (Administration) at Himalaya Airlines, the Nepal-Tibet joint venture. There are five airlines currently connecting China. “The traffic is low,” said Shrestha. “It may be due to low consumer confidence.”Himalaya Airlines has suspended Kathmandu-Beijing flights, and Kathmandu-Shanghai flights are also irregular due to low passenger traffic. Besides, in the other three sectors, the average occupancy is 40 percent,” said Shrestha. “The announcement from Beijing to promote Nepal in China could change that.”Nepal and China established formal diplomatic relations in 1955, and Nepal-Tibet trade goes a long way back. In 1956, four cities of Tibet, namely Lhasa, Shigatse, Gyantse, and Yatung, were designated as major trading cities for Nepali traders.Between the founding of the People’s Republic of China in 1949 and 1982, few residents of China travelled to foreign destinations other than government officials, students, and a few businessmen. In 1983, China allowed citizens from Guangdong Province to travel to the British colony of Hong Kong on organised tours to visit family.Beginning in 1995, the Chinese National Tourism Administration formalised China’s Approved Destination Status (ADS) policy.The history of Chinese tourism in Nepal is not long either. Nepal first participated in the China International Travel Fair in 2000 to promote its tourism sector. Before 2000, the Chinese could only travel to Nepal on official visits.The Chinese government had permitted ADS for Chinese outbound travellers in November 2001. The two countries signed an initial memorandum of understanding on an implementation plan for outbound travel by Chinese people to Nepal on April 16, 2001, laying the groundwork for the ADS.Nepal was given the Approved Destination Status (ADS) by its northern neighbour in 2002, and in June of the same year, Chinese citizens began visiting Nepal officially for the first time as tourists. Nepal was the 18th nation to receive the status and first in South Asia. In 2002, Nepal got 8,715 Chinese tourists.Subsequently, the central banks of the two countries signed an agreement on bilateral cooperation that allowed the Chinese currency to be converted into Nepali rupees in a bid to boost bilateral trade, tourism, and economic cooperation.However, immediately after Nepal received the ADS, arrivals from China fell due to a violent conflict that intensified over 2002-2004, reaching Nepal’s main cities and tourist destinations. Nepal eventually started witnessing a constant growth in Chinese arrivals after June 2009.Chinese arrivals to Nepal crossed the 100,000 mark for the first time in 2013, mainly due to the improved air links between the two countries. According to the tourism ministry’s statistics, around 93 percent of Chinese tourists were first-time visitors to Nepal.In 2014, Nepal received 123,805 Chinese visitors.The 2015 earthquake and India's blockade led to arrivals from China dropping to a four-year low of 64,675 individuals in 2015, down 47.76 percent from 2014.The surface road at the Tatopani border point, where Nepal used to receive many Chinese tourists, was also blocked.On December 25, 2015, Nepal announced ‘free visa’ for Chinese tourists, giving them the same treatment accorded to South Asian visitors. In a bid to revive flagging arrivals, the scheme was implemented in January 2016.Thereon, tourist arrivals from China started rising steadily, and Nepal saw the strongest growth, 46.8 percent, in tourist arrivals from China, with the overall number reaching 153,633 visitors in 2018.In 2019, Nepal received a record 169,543 Chinese tourists.The number fell to 19,257 in 2020. In 2021 and 2022, there were 6,198 and 9,599 Chinese tourists in Nepal—mainly diplomats and those stranded in third countries—who came to Nepal when Beijing enforced never-ending lockdowns.When the Chinese economy started to boom again, Nepali investors pumped money into luxury hotels, which too have multiplied. \nLast month, a local from Sindhupalchowk district was brought to Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital to treat a snakebite. Along with the victim, relatives brought the live snake in a bottle to show the doctor as proof.“The snake was a king cobra,” said Dr Yuba Nidhi Basaula, director at the Hospital. “Fortunately, the venom had not penetrated deep into the victim’s body, and after three days of treatment, the victim was discharged. We called a snake handler and handed over the king cobra.”Sindhupalchowk is a mountain district where venomous snakes were thought of as non-existent. However, incidents of king cobra bites in mountain districts like Sindhupalchowk suggest that venomous snakes have started migrating towards hill and mountain districts, and rising temperatures caused by climate change are the main culprit, experts say.Nepal is among the world’s most vulnerable countries to the climate crisis and has witnessed multiple extreme weather events over the past decade and a half.Evidence suggests that maximum temperatures in Nepal are rising at a faster rate of 0.056 degrees Celsius a year, compared to the global average rise of 0.03 degrees Celsius a year. Compared to districts of the Tarai region, those in hills and mountains have been witnessing a more rapid increase in daytime maximum temperatures, which could have helped venomous snakes survive there, experts say.“Not only in Sindhupalchowk, but a king cobra bite was also spotted in Godawari of Lalitpur district last year,” said Basaula. “Snakebite cases have started rising alarmingly of late.”Of the 31 patients admitted to the hospital on Sunday, 16—more than 50 percent—were snakebite cases. Doctors at the hospital say eight to ten snakebite victims seek treatment there every day, and most victims seeking care at the hospital are from the districts of Kathmandu Valley or from those adjoining the Valley.Each year, around 2,700 people, mostly children and women from Nepal’s Tarai region, die of snakebites, according to a March 2022 report published in The Lancet, a leading international medical journal.However, snakebite cases are vastly underreported in the country. The Ministry of Health and Population said that only 14 deaths and 1,220 cases of snakebites had been reported in 11 months of the current fiscal year. Officials admit that venomous snakebite incidents are being reported from hill and mountain districts, and the demand for anti-snake venom is on the rise. They attribute this rise in snakebite incidents to rising temperatures. “Health facilities in some mountainous and hilly districts—like Darchula and Bajura—have asked for anti-snake venom,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Snakebite incidents have been on the rise,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the division. “With the onset of the monsoon, people living in the risk areas should remain vigilant.”Every year, the Health Ministry purchases around 25,000 vials of anti-snake venom and distributes them to around 100 snakebite treatment centres in the country.Officials say as snakebite cases surge, so will the demand for additional treatment centres. “This year, we are planning to set up an additional 15 snakebite treatment centres,” said Ojha. Public health experts have urged authorities to launch an awareness drive about the risks. They say people living in thatched-roof houses are particularly vulnerable to snakebites, as snakes often enter such homes in search of rats. They say people should be asked to keep their homes and surroundings clean, prevent children from playing in bushy areas, avoid venturing out at night, and use torchlights while walking in the dark.Likewise, women and children who have to work in fields and go to the jungle are at the highest risk of snakebites. Small children are at risk of dying from snakebites, as they do not tell their parents about the bites on time due to fear of getting scolded for playing in the bushes, according to doctors.“We should make people aware so that they seek medical attention immediately after a snakebite, using whatever means of transport they get,” said Ojha. “The faster you reach the hospital, the greater your chances of survival.” \nThe duel between Kathmandu’s 34-year-old mayor Balendra Shaha (popularly called Balen), a structural engineer, reputed rapper and political novice, and 72-year-old Khagda Prasad Sharma Oli, a high school dropout, two-time prime minister, political veteran and chairperson of the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist) is a caricature of contemporary Nepali politics marred by the conflict between the old and the young. The duel has attracted numerous newspaper articles, set social media on fire and provided YouTubers a field day. What is Oli’s motive in mobilising his whole party to attack Balen, and what is Balen—a lone man with no political experience and political following—doing picking a fight with Oli? How will the duel impact Oli’s party and Balen’s aspirations going forward? The fightThe Balen-Oli fight began when the metropolitan city started to clear buildings built illegally on municipal land or business advertisements that did not comply with municipal regulations. The city would order the current occupants of the offending buildings or business owners to comply with the law and vacate the premises. In most cases, the occupants would ignore the order. Like in old times, they relied on their political connections to continue to subvert the law. However, that did not work with Balen. He sent municipal forces to demolish the encroachment and non-compliant adverts. The first property subjected to the mayor's action belonged to someone connected to the UML. Soon after the clearance, a Central Committee member of the UML, Mahesh Basnet, called upon his minions to physically harm Balen if he did not “mend his ways”.Balen’s attempt to clean up Kathmandu from squatters occupying public land, particularly river banks, intensified the conflict. Oli publicly mocked Balen for using bulldozers to demolish plastic shades built by “poor squatters.” Some “squatters” are believed to occupy multistory buildings constructed on public land and own businesses worth millions of rupees. The majority of them are UML voters, “UMLs’ vote bank”, observed a Balen supporter. The squatter problem is not new. All previous governments, including the one led by Oli, recognised it. The conflict became increasingly acrimonious when Balen opened the basement of Dharahara for car parking. The government objected, arguing that the reconstruction of Dharahara is still incomplete and the car park is unsafe to use. Balen retorted, “Dharahara was inaugurated as a completed project by Prime Minister Oli before the last election. How can it be incomplete?” The inauguration of the work-in-progress was one of Prime Minister Oli’s pre-election charades. The car park is safe and currently in use; the reconstruction continues. The recent New Road imbroglio added fuel to the fire. Balen started widening the footpath on New Road to comply with the standards set by the Nepal Department of Roads (NDR). A local ward chair, a UML member, objected and complained to the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport headed by Deputy Prime Minister Ragubhir Mahaseth, an Oli acolyte. The NDR, which reports to Mahaseth, issued a “stop work” order. Incensed, Balen asked Oli to expeditiously arrange repayment for those who cheated the so-called Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land plotting scandal. Oli’s apparatchiks compared Balen to “a puppy” (a good-for-nothing weakling) and chastised him for maligning “our respected Chairman”. Oli himself has described Balen as a “bubble” which will fizzle out in no time. The fightersOli is old, witty, foxy, prickly, intolerant of criticism and, like all other politicians, corrupt in the public eye. As enunciated during his premiership, his vision of economic development includes building view towers, providing Kathmandu households with piped gas within six months, and building facilities for maritime trade—the latter two unachievable pipe dreams or political ploys. Balen is young, angry, ambitious, audacious, brash, bold, impulsive, focussed and untainted by corruption. His vision for Kathmandu is to make it a clean, functioning, beautiful heritage city. In about two years since he became mayor, Kathmandu has become relatively cleaner and greener. Its roads are rid of perpetual potholes; its sidewalks are walkable; teaching standards in public schools have improved; private schools who were short-changing on paying taxes have been forced to pay their share; emergency ambulance service has become more dependable, and so on. All of the above, despite a lack of support from political parties and the government. Parties do not support him because his success will spotlight their past failures. Despite the odds, his accomplishments have made him hugely popular throughout the country. “If we have ten leaders like Balen, we can change the country,” an exuberant Kathmandu taxi driver told me. Even the international press has taken note of Balen’s leadership. The New York Times published a story on Balen last year. He was named one of the 100 upcoming leaders in 2023 by the internationally known Time Magazine, published in the US. Balen’s public support is so visceral that he gets away even with outrageous comments like “burning Singha Durbar’, Nepal’s central secretariat, the office of Nepal’s Ministries, and irrelevant dragging of Oli into the “Giri Bandhu Tea Estate” scandal, and other similar outbursts. Although the overwhelming support for such comments on social media is surprising, it is indicative of the intensity of public dislike of established politicians.The future Balen knows that he owes his popularity as much to his performance as his refusal to bow down to political pressure and to stay clean from corruption scandals. In the two years since he assumed office, he has given confidence to the city dwellers that with exemplary leadership, the city and the country can be changed. His future depends on whether he can continue to ignore political pressure and demonstrate his perseverance, will, guts and vision to turn chaotic Kathmandu into a livable metropolis. As for Oli, UML lost the last election in Kathmandu because its mayor, a UML member, was a dismal failure. The confrontation with Balen for political upmanship and ego inflation will unlikely win Kathmandu for him. Cooperation may work better than confrontation.    \n“It would be most appropriate for us to collaborate with independent forces such as Balen and Gopi Hamal instead of Oli and Prachanda [Pushpa Kamal Dahal].”This statement by Rastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal on Wednesday has stirred a debate: are the new and traditional political forces really so incompatible that they cannot collaborate, and how likely is it for the new forces to come together?RSP General Secretary Dhakal emphasised the need for working with new forces such as Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah and Mayor of Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City Gopi Hamal, rather than entering into coalitions and partnerships with older crop of politicians like CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who is also chief of the CPN (Maoist Centre).Dhakal said so after submitting an assessment report on the RSP’s standing among the people to party president Rabi Lamichhane, who is deputy prime minister and home minister in the Dahal-led government.Dhakal prepared the 32-page report after touring 38 districts and interacting with nearly 3,000 people in a period of one month as tasked by the party soon after its by-election debacle in Ilam-2.After the tour, Dhakal concluded that giving continuity to the partnership with traditional political parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre could prove counterproductive for the RSP in the long run. After the electoral setback in Ilam-2, where the party’s candidate could not even retain the security deposit, an RSP secretariat meeting on May 3 had tasked General Secretary Dhakal with the responsibility of conducting a nationwide tour to assess public sentiment towards the party.Political observers see Dhakal’s call as obvious. As new political outfits get less space to manoeuvre while working with traditional parties, not only the RSP but other newer political forces also find it challenging to assert their relevance.“As the new party that emerged as a political force by capitalising on public discontent with traditional parties failed to outperform them, a negative narrative is taking shape,” Chandra Dev Bhatta, a political scientist, told the Post. Any political party needs a political plank to survive for any length of time. However, new outfits lack this, making it difficult for them to work with other political parties, especially the traditional ones, says Bhatta. “When new political parties lack clear agenda and principles, on what basis will they have smooth cooperation with the traditional guards?” Bhatta added. “This is why new political forces will face difficulties while working with the old parties.”But the RSP had a political plank. During the 2022 general elections, the party capitalised on the public disillusionment with the old political parties by promising good governance, and a crackdown on corruption. The anti-corruption campaign quickly propelled the party into national politics within a short time after its establishment. However, the party failed to live up to the political agenda it championed during the election campaign when it joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on December 25, 2022, for the first time. The party quit the government within months after Lamichhane was stripped of his parliamentary position following controversy over his citizenship certificate. The party rejoined the Dahal-led government on March 4 after the changes in the coalition.The RSP leaders have been criticised for failing to live up to their promises and colluding with traditional parties. Dhakal, after submitting his assessment report to party chief Lamichhane, acknowledged that the party failed to fulfil the promises made to voters on the campaign trail. “It was a mistake of the party to ally with the old guards of politics which the RSP heavily criticised in the past,” Dhakal told the Post.Leaders from other new outfits think that it is a compulsion to work with the old forces despite differences in working styles. Chandan Jha, general secretary of the Janamat Party, another new political outfit that emerged after the 2022 elections, says it is natural for new parties to feel uncomfortable while cooperating with traditional ones.“One reason why new parties face problems while allying with old ones is differences in operational approaches between them,” Jha told the Post. “The working styles of new and old ones are different, which makes it difficult to collaborate.”However, given our electoral system that has made it difficult for a political party to secure a majority in parliament, cooperation with other parties is the only way to form a government and survive, Jha adds. The Janamat Party has succeeded in taking the leadership of the Madhesh provincial government by unseating the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal of veteran Madhesh leader Upendra Yadav. Various parties that Yadav led had continuously led the provincial government for over seven years. The CK Raut-led Janamat Party succeeded in displacing Yadav’s party only with the support of traditional parties like the UML and the Maoist Centre. The Janamat Party supported the Dahal-led coalition at the centre and the UML-Maoist coalition backed the party’s leadership in the province. A leader of the Maoist Centre describes the statement of RSP General Secretary Dhakal as a reflection of growing public frustration with the party. The new party that had enjoyed overwhelming public support during the 2022 election is now facing a reality check, says the Maoist leader.“It is true that people disillusioned with traditional political parties supported the RSP and other new outfits during the 2022 elections,” Lekh Nath Dahal, Maoist Centre lawmaker told the Post. “But the level of public frustration is not always the same, and not always against the same parties.”The RSP, which has failed to perform while in government, however, is blaming the old parties for its failure, Dahal said.“What has the RSP done while leading the home ministry?” Dahal questioned. “Like the old parties, the president of a new political party is promoting and transferring police personnel at his whim.” The Post briefly talked to the RSP’s Dhakal on Wednesday, immediately after he submitted the report to party president Lamichhane. He said that the party should explore the chances of collaborating with independent figures such as mayors Shah and Hamal even though the party does not endorse all of their activities.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on some of his plans such as clearing illegally occupied land in slum areas in Kathmandu,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider forming alliances with Shah and Hamal.”But political analyst Bhatta doubts the chances of collaboration between RSP and independent mayors Shah and Hamal. Bhatta says the working styles and issues championed by Shah, Hamal, and RSP leadership don’t match. “However, if they somehow come together, they can possibly be a powerful political force,” Bhatta adds. \n\nDespite experiencing a financial crisis in 2022, Sri Lanka's tourism industry has rebounded due to its rich culture, natural resources, and ancient irrigation system.\nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n**Summarize the following events in 1 line without losing crucial information**:\n\n1.

Fueled by alcohol, they spew an exorbitant amount of profanity in every sentence. “What a bitch!” they whine repeatedly (among other disgraceful rants.) As their profanity intensifies and they descend into a frenzy, the story unfolds: their female colleague had merely voiced her frustration about feeling underutilised and underestimated in the office. She communicated, though cunningly, about how she was given fewer projects than her male colleague, who contributed little. Communicating assertively about discrimination in the workforce? Indeed! What a bitchy thing to do.Sexist men in the workplace are infuriating beyond belief. This fury and exasperation is amplified in the workforce because sexist men severely underestimate women. They often refuse to collaborate with you due to their long-internalised assumption of female incompetence. ‘Play the System’ is a familiar play because it reflects the common sexism and discrimination women and girls face in the workforce. To sexist ‘corporate bros,’ women are merely decorative, and subservience is a woman’s most remarkable quality. This theatre production capitalises on stereotypes, increasing its relatability. Kausi Theatre's compactness fully envelops the audience, and the wonderful actors completely captivate from the start. You are so intensely focused that you find yourself cursing alongside the characters, feeling their frustration boiling within you, and recollecting similar experiences from your own life.Sailesh (played by Eelum Dixit) is the boss who favours his male colleague over his female counterpart and exhibits severe discrimination against women. Biswas (played by Suraj Malla) is the enabler, a bystander who occasionally voices mild dissonance about women to appease his boss but generally remains silent. Pankaj (played by Rishikesh Basyal) is a stereotypical slacker, all talk and no action, who uses philosophical jargon to mask his incompetence. Chahana (played by Roshani Syanbo) is a quintessential “pick me” character. She is eager to please the men in the office, switching her tone to please them and complying without protest. She is the embodiment of submission, which is why the men in the office tolerate her. Namita (played by Ranjana Bhattarai) is confident, smart, and exceptionally talented, but in this competitive architecture firm, she must navigate the system carefully to be taken seriously.Namita’s theme song would undoubtedly be Taylor Swift's ‘The Man’: “I'm so sick of running as fast as I can, wondering if I would get there quicker if I was a man.” In contrast to her colleague Pankaj, who garners praise for minimal effort, Namita struggles to secure meaningful assignments and faces pervasive assumptions of incompetence. Even when she delivers, her achievements are frequently overlooked and overtly scrutinised. Her story reflects the broader challenges working women endure in male-dominated fields, where despite their undeniable talent, they are often unfairly judged as sub-par or deemed incompetent.Women often have to go out of their way just to be acknowledged or appreciated. The rat race and corporate grind become even more intense for women due to the additional hurdles they face. Namita has no choice but to become the “bitch” her coworkers think she is, or she won't survive the workplace. Despite the discrimination and frustrations she faces, Namita persists. The dynamics between Namita and Chahana are deeply interesting to watch. Both women are victims of rampant sexism in their workplace, but they respond differently: Chahana bends to the discrimination, while Namita protests against it.From the audience's perspective, neither woman is wrong—they are simply doing what it takes to survive in a male-dominated, toxic environment. They clash over this difference, with Namita judging Chahana for choosing to stay ignorant, while Chahana criticises Namita for being too confrontational and not complying with the 'system' that discriminates against her.Watching these characters interact with one another is highly amusing. A recurring joke about ‘piping’ threads throughout the production, becoming funnier each time the issue is mentioned. The actors skillfully make the audience love and hate them simultaneously—all characters are grey to varying degrees.It can be enjoyable to watch a grey female character; the majority of the audience may even think ‘good for her,’ when Namita cunningly plays games to preserve herself within the system.For women, this play is catharsis. The moment when Namita breaks down, overwhelmed by the realisation that no matter how hard she tries, it is never enough, becomes a pivotal point of emotional release. Watching how Namita is treated by the audience may also help women recognise that, more often than not, they are not the problem; sexism is.This play would’ve easily been five stars if it didn’t have the ending it does. It felt as if the ending drove the play away from the message it was originally trying to convey.However, with brilliant writing, wonderful actors, beautiful set design, and an evocative storyline that represents women’s plight, this play is a must-watch. For me, it might even warrant a re-watch because it delivers an important message while being deeply engaging, funny, delightful, and wholesome at times.It accurately depicts human relationships and is a release for women who have always been suppressed or labelled as ‘bossy’ for simply being competent and confident.Despite claims that feminism is unnecessary and sexism is non-existent (by the Saileshs and Pankajs themselves), the impact this play has on women proves otherwise.With sexism, it is important to take the bull by the horns, as there is no progress in the face of denial. By acknowledging the impacts of sexism, we are actively sparing confident little girls who are unfairly labelled as 'bossy' or 'annoying' from the challenges faced by women like Namita.Play the SystemDirector: Akanchha KarkiCast: Eelum Dixit, Ranjana Bhattarai, Suraj Malla, Roshani Syangbo, Rishikesh BasyalDuration: 1 hour 30 minutesVenue: Kausi Theatre, TekuShowtimes: Every day at 5:15 pm and an extra 1:00 pm show on Saturday until July 15 \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) will hold its general convention, where leaders negotiate the election of new leadership through consensus or potential contests, while ensuring continuity at the top and aiming to retain members despite diminished influence.\nThe process to appoint the chairman at the Securities Board of Nepal (Sebon) was cancelled on Friday.The Ministry of Finance issued a notice on Friday stating that the recommendation process was cancelled. Back on January 17, the government formed a three-member committee led by the Vice Chairman of the National Planning Commission, Min Bahadur Shrestha, to recommend a candidate for chairman of the Sebon to the Cabinet. Two members of the committee were Finance Secretary Madhu Kumar Marasini and Prof Udaya Niraula. As per the mandate, the Shrestha-led committee on February 28 invited applications from interested individuals. However, the Finance Ministry’s notice on Friday announced that the entire recommendation process was cancelled.Earlier, responding to the committee’s call, 19 candidates had submitted their applications to lead the country’s only security board. The recommendation committee later short-listed five candidates for the interview. The five shortlisted candidates were Nabaraj Adhikari, Chiranjivi Chapagain, Krishna Bahadur Karki, Mukti Nath Shrestha, and Santosh Shrestha. However, only two candidates, Mukti Nath Shrestha and Santosh Shrestha, appeared in the interview. Sources inside the Finance Ministry told the Post that both Shresthas were backed by the ruling party, CPN-UML, while Adhikari, Chapagain, and Karki were regarded as close to the CPN (Maoist Centre), the prime minister’s party.After only two candidates appeared in the interview, the recommendation committee informed the three candidates—Adhikari, Chapagain, and Karki—to reappear in the interview and set a new date.Despite this, the three did not appear in the interview the second time. As per the Sebon Act, it is compulsory to recommend at least three names to the Cabinet for the final selection. When the committee failed to recommend three names even after the second round, the Shrestha-led committee sought legal advice from the Office of the Attorney General. The Office of the Attorney General communicated to the recommendation committee that the entire selection process would be invalid if three names were not recommended to the Cabinet. “The Attorney General's office explained that it is not possible to recommend only two people who participated in the interview, then we, after consultation with Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, decided to cancel the entire process,” a member of the recommendation committee told the Post.The finance ministry official said only two candidates were present in the interview and presentation, so the recommendation committee decided not to risk recommending only two names to the cabinet, which ultimately led to the cancellation of the entire process.“The process collapsed after a tussle between two ruling parties,” an official at the Finance Ministry said, adding that there is a confusion about what will happen next.Sources inside the Finance Ministry said the selection process became the victim of the political power play between the UML and the Maoist Centre, leading to the cancellation of the entire process.Sebon was established by the government of Nepal on June 7, 1993, as an apex regulator of securities markets. It has been regulating the market under the Securities Act of 2006. The governing board of Sebon comprises seven members, including one full-time chairman appointed by the government for a tenure of four years. The term of Sebon chairman has been fixed for four years, but it has been over three months that the position has been vacant. Due to the government’s failure to appoint a new chairman, security issuance applications worth billions of rupees are pending. \nRastriya Swatantra Party (RSP) General Secretary Mukul Dhakal, in his political document prepared after a review tour of 32 districts, has claimed that the party is headed for an accident.In his political report, Dhakal has pointed out things the two-year old party needs to rectify in order to avert such an accident. After handing over the 32-page report to party president Rabi Lamichhane on Wednesday, Dhakal told the Post: “After the review tour, I have come to the conclusion that if the party continues to run as it does now, it will crash within a short period.”The report Dhakal submitted to Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and minister for home affairs, claims that the popularity of the party which emerged by winning 20 seats in the 2022 election has nosedived. Additionally, the report argues that Lamichhane’s popularity has also dipped. Dhakal demanded that the party should make his report public. But an RSP leader, who is also a federal lawmaker, says as the report deals with the party’s internal matters, it should first have been discussed within the RSP secretariat.“General Secretary Dhakal made a mistake by going to the media before discussing the matter in the party,” the leader told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “Why Dhakal went to the media is a curious matter.”However, Dhakal responded that as the general secretary, he came to the media for the first time since the party’s establishment two years ago. “You should understand why the party is being criticised from various quarters today,” Dhakal told the Post. “The party has faced ruin due to someone’s loose talk. I haven’t done so.”Dhakal’s apparent target was party president Lamichhane, who is often criticised for making unnecessary comments and promises. Although the general secretary has submitted a report based on his observations during the review trip, the implementation of the findings will come only after the party’s secretariat meeting, said Kabindra Burlakoti, the organisational committee head and joint general secretary of the party. “The general secretary personally prepared and submitted the report. No other leaders of the party were involved in its preparation,” Burlakoti told the Post. “The report might not be implemented as it is, and the party’s secretariat might amend it.”Soon after the by-election debacle in April this year, a secretariat meeting of the party on May 3 decided to conduct a cross-country review tour under a Dhakal-led team.The RSP had won one more seat in the House of Representatives from the by-elections held a year ago. But this year, the party’s candidate in Ilam-2 did not win enough votes and even lost the security deposit. RSP candidate Milan Limbu stood fourth when independent candidate Dikendra Singh Limbu won third-highest votes in the constituency.Dhakal commenced the journey on May 19 with the objective of identifying the party’s strengths and weaknesses, in relation to its policies, decisions, and organisational structure. While seeing off Dhakal, Lamichhane expressed his belief that the suggestions and insights gathered during the tour would make the party stronger. The party, which last year secured two out of three by-election seats in Chitwan-2 and Tanahun-1, was optimistic about giving the competitors a tough fight in Ilam-2 in April. While talking to the Post, party leaders engaged in the campaign were then confident of a good performance. On the campaign trail of the 2022 election, RSP leaders, mainly its chair Lamichhane, fiercely criticised leaders of traditional parties and asked voters to remove them from power. However, the RSP leaders then stood accused of working in collusion with the same old parties and their leaders, especially the UML. Additionally, when Lamichhane was linked to various scams, most recently the routing of the cooperative’s money to Gorkha Media Network, the party lost its lustre, leading to its poor performance in Ilam-2. During the election campaign in Ilam-2, Lamichhane was also questioned over a conflict of interest, as his ministry was commanding the police force that was investigating such scams. The RSP joined the Pushpa Kamal Dahal-led government on March 4. RSP President Lamichhane won back the home ministry by driving a hard bargain. Some saw Lamichhane’s insistence on the home ministry as an attempt to try to influence the investigation into the cooperative scam. General Secretary Dhakal claims that the party’s popularity has taken a beating, not only due to the cooperative scam but also because of the party leaders’ unfulfilled promises to voters.Before joining the government on March 4, RSP leaders extensively discussed the ‘Mission 2084’ aimed at making the RSP the largest force in the next general elections. Observers said that the party had joined the government even when it is not in a position to honour its promises to the people.Santosh Pariyar, chief whip of the party in the federal parliament, said he is not fully informed on the report submitted by the party general secretary.“I can’t comment on the report without first going through it,” Pariyar told the Post. “We can say something concrete only after the report is formally presented at the party’s secretariat meeting.”However, party insiders claim that the report criticises the party leadership’s rush for power without much care for the RSP’s original agenda. Another party leader, who also asked not to be named, said the report suggests that the party should have allied with leaders such as Balendra Shah, the mayor of Kathmandu Metropolitan City, rather than joining hands with traditional forces like the UML and the Maoist Centre.Shah is believed to be quietly laying the ground for launching his own political party, cashing in on the public anger against traditional forces.Dhakal also acknowledged that he wants the party to better communicate with Mayor Shah. The RSP should explore the chances of cooperating with him even though the party does not endorse all of his recent activities, Dhakal told the Post.“To start with, the RSP should cooperate with Shah on an agenda like evacuating illegally occupied land in slum areas,” Dhakal said. “By the end of 2083 BS [a year ahead of the 2027 election], the party should also consider allying with Shah.”Despite being in the government, some RSP ministers and party leaders have voiced their dissatisfaction. Minister for Youth and Sports Biraj Bhakta Shrestha, addressing a function a few weeks ago, said that time had come to review the party’s participation in the government and its support for the coalition. Shrestha even warned the party leaders to be ready to quit the government. Claiming that they carry resignation letters all the time, Shrestha said, “As soon as we start feeling frustrated, we will put in our papers.” \nIn a bid to lessen the spread of the dengue virus during the ongoing monsoon season, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has decided to continue the drive to destroy mosquito larvae and breeding grounds. Officials at the health department of the city office said on Friday that they have just completed a week-long drive in all 32 wards of the metropolis and plan to continue these efforts in the coming days as well.“Every Wednesday, our health volunteers will visit households and open spaces to destroy mosquito breeding grounds,” said Rishi Bhusal, epidemic prevention and control focal person at the metropolis. “Decisions on preventive measures including launching search and destroy drives will depend on the spread of virus and intensity of rainfall in the coming days.”Dengue is a viral disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vectors also transmit chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika virus, according to the World Health Organisation.According to data provided by the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, at least 1,268 people from 72 districts have been infected with the dengue virus since January this year. Among the 72 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases: 141. Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Many people infected with dengue show mild symptoms and can be treated with paracetamol at home.Dengue symptoms include mild to high fever, severe muscle pain, rashes, severe headache, and pain in the eyes. Patients with these symptoms are advised to seek immediate treatment. While there is no specific cure for the disease, early detection and proper medical care can prevent death.Nepal reported its first dengue case in a foreigner in 2004 in the Chitwan district. Since then, an increasing number of dengue infections have been reported from many districts, including major dengue outbreaks. Last year, at least 20 persons died, and more than 52,000 were infected by the virus, which had spread to all 77 districts.In 2022, a total of 88 people died, and over 54,000 were infected by the virus across the country. During that period, hospitals in the Kathmandu Valley were overwhelmed with dengue patients, and pharmacies ran out of paracetamol, the most widely used medicine to treat fever.In 2019, the disease killed at least six people and more than 16,000 were hospitalised across the country. The virus had spread to 68 districts at the time.Though the post-monsoon period is considered the dengue epidemic season, the deadly disease has already become endemic in Nepal, as outbreaks of the virus are reported every month, including in the winter months.Officials at the health department said that 654 health workers, including female community health volunteers, were deployed in the week-long campaign, which concluded on Friday.“Volunteers and health workers who were deployed to the door-to-door campaign checked the mosquito breeding grounds and the larvae, made people aware about the risks and destroyed the breeding grounds,” said Bhusal. Health workers reported that storage places for scrap materials, discarded cups, and plastic in open spaces, and unused lands as potential hotspots for the dengue virus in the coming days. Health workers have warned owners of these sites that action will be taken if mosquito larvae are found against the owner of the storage place if mosquito larvae were found.Dengue-transmitting mosquitoes breed in clean water and bite people in daylight. Uncovered water tanks and discarded objects, such as plastic cups and bottles, could be breeding grounds for these mosquitoes.Public health experts say now is the right time to prepare for and prevent possible outbreaks. Health ministry officials said they have alerted all related agencies to the risk of a dengue outbreak. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has imparted mental health screening training to doctors and paramedics serving at urban health promotion centres.Officials at the Health Department in the metropolis hope that the move will help hundreds of patients with mental health issues in the city to get timely treatment.“Getting free treatment for mental health problems comes under the right to get free basic health care services,” said Sajina Maharjan, acting head of the department. “Mental health problem screening training to doctors and paramedics will help in the timely diagnosis of the problems and start of early treatment.”At least 32 doctors serving at the urban health promotion centres under the city office and dozens of paramedics participated in five-day screening training. The metropolis has upgraded its urban health clinics to urban health promotion centres and started providing services through medical doctors. “Due to the lack of doctors at our urban health promotion centres, patients suffering from mental health problems have been deprived of timely treatment,” said Nali Bajracharya, a senior public health officer at the department. “Now patients having mental health issues and seeking care at our health centres will also get mental health treatment.”Though neither the federal government agency nor the city office has data on the number of people suffering from mental health problems in the metropolis, doctors estimated that a lot of people could be suffering from various forms of mental health problems—anxiety, depression and others.Officials say that they are also planning to provide free medication to patients with mental health problems.Health workers say that many city dwellers, despite having mental health problems, do not seek treatment and instead turn to drugs and substances to cope. Due to the entrenched social stigma, fear of discrimination and other factors, many patients in Nepal do not talk about their mental health issues.The general tendency among people to conceal mental health issues due to the stigma attached to it has also forced patients to opt for substance abuse, doctors say.They say that while drugs and alcohol may provide temporary relief from stress, they are not a solution and can adversely affect mental health and well-being in the long run.“Treatment in the initial stage of mental illness helps patients achieve better results. For that, early diagnosis is crucial,” said Dr Pomawati Thapa, chief of the Non-communicable Disease and Mental Health Section at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “Other local units should also follow the initiative to provide mental health screening training to health workers, including doctors.”Nepal is among the countries with highest rates of suicide, which is an extreme manifestation of a mental health problem.According to Nepal Police data, 6,993 people took their own lives in the fiscal year 2022-2023. This accounts for more than 19 deaths on average daily. Fifty-six percent of those who die by suicide are men.Doctors say that people do not attempt suicide for a single reason, but due to a complex situation arising from multiple problems.An increasing number of people are struggling with mental problems owing to the rising cost of living and the struggle to manage even their most basic needs, such as food, housing, healthcare and jobs, experts say.Whatever the cause, suicides and suicide attempts have a ripple effect, impacting families, friends, colleagues, communities and societies, doctors say.A study carried out by the Nepal Health Research Council in the past shows that about 13 percent of Nepalis suffer from some form of mental disorder. This means around one in eight Nepalis has mental health issues. Moreover, the country simply does not have enough experts to treat mental health problems, it added.Studies show the magnitude of suffering, the burden and costs for individuals, families and societies arising from mental health disorders are alarming in Nepal.“No doubt, mental health problems have been emerging as a major cause of morbidity and mortality in our country,” said Thapa. “All local governments must take initiative to address the problems. Only the federal government agencies cannot do much.”The World Health Organisation says that one in four people in the world has been affected by mental or neurological disorders at some point in their lives, and around 450 million people currently suffer from such conditions, placing mental disorders among the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. \nDuring the 2022 local level election, people of Kathmandu elected independent candidate Balendra Shah as their mayor for five years. Sunita Dangol of the CPN-UML secured the position of KMC deputy mayor in the same election. When they began their term, many suspected that the two—an independent mayor and his party-affiliated deputy—wouldn’t have cordial relations. But, in the last two years of their term, there has been no visible disagreement between them. They proved their sceptics wrong.Deputy Mayor Dangol kept mum when Mayor Shah accused her party chair, KP Sharma Oli, of policy corruption in the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate land scam.Moreover, Shah expressed his anger on June 3 over the government’s intervention in his plan to widen pavements in the New Road area. Deputy Prime Minister Raghubir Mahaseth of the UML leads the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport, which maintains major roads.After the ministry intervened in the municipal plan to expand the sidewalk on New Road, Shah took to social media and wrote, “Honourable KP Oli jyu, don’t hoodwink people by engineering yet another scam to hide a scam of Rs10,000 crore [Rs100 billion].”He further added, “You have reassured those who had made advance payments to buy land of Giri Bandhu Tea Estate that they would get the land within two years.” “If one looks at the policy corruption in the tea estate, it appears not a single leaf would stir without Oli’s nod,” Shah wrote.A few days prior to the incident, Mayor Shah had engaged in a heated debate with Chinkaji Maharjan, a UML member and chairman of KMC’s ward 22, over the sidewalk expansion plan.Dangol remained quiet on the issue thus far. However, at the city council meeting on Monday, which also discussed KMC's policies and programmes for the fiscal year 2024-25, she criticised Mayor Shah for his remarks.“This should be the first time the deputy mayor opposed the public behavior and statement of the mayor,” a Kathmandu ward chairperson told the Post on the condition of anonymity.Dangol had her initial plan to contest the mayor position independently but the UML gave her the deputy mayor’s ticket.Speaking during the Monday discussion, Deputy Mayor Dangol said, addressing Mayor Shah, “Your and mine voices are being heard and watched by Nepalis worldwide. Therefore, those of us who want to come to politics should think about our expression,” Dangol remarked. “We should maintain the image and dignity of the institution we represent.”She also emphasised the need to accommodate the voices of everyone in an undertaking.Though the representatives of Kathmandu Metropolitan City claim that Dangol's Monday statement was unusual, they deny any rift between the two leaders of the local government. “City council’s is an internal meeting of the KMC where various issues arise. We settle those issues internally,” Nabin Manandhar, the KMC spokesperson and ward 17 chairman from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “Having an opinion does not necessarily mean criticism.”Rajesh Kumar Shrestha, chair of KMC ward 19, seconded Manandhar.However, local representatives of Kathmandu have been questioning Shah for his ‘lone-wolf’ manner of leading the institution.“We should develop a working relationship that welcomes everyone’s spirit,” Dangol told the council meeting. “If one thinks they are in a position and everything should be done as they say, it will only lead to trouble.”She added, “While working in a team, we definitely have a different opinion, but different opinions should be respected.”At the meeting, referring to Mayor Shah's past statements, council member Anita Karki asked him, saying, “What if the voters of Kathmandu set ablaze the Durbar where the KMC office lies?”In September last year, when the traffic police obstructed a KMC vehicle, later known to be used by his postpartum wife, Mayor Shah provocatively wrote on Facebook, threatening to burn Singha Durbar, the federal government’s central secretariat.Traffic police, under the federal government, had stopped the vehicle to check necessary documents on a Saturday.After the incident, Shah wrote on social media warning that if the government blocked KMC's vehicles again, he would set fire to Singha Durbar.Dangol said on Monday that she believed it was wrong to write on social media or make a statement inciting people to burn the Singha Durbar or the Bagh Durbar, where the KMC office is situated.Dangol, speaking at the city council meeting, also said there should be no polarisation between the representatives who were elected to develop Kathmandu. \nA police officer was found dead on the premises of the federal parliament building in Baneshwar, Kathmandu on Wednesday.According to Ekram Giri, spokesperson for the federal parliament secretariat, Ajit Gole of Dolakha committed suicide by shooting himself.The body of the victim was recovered from the parliament building’s washroom.Dinesh Mainali, spokesperson for the Kathmandu Metro Police Range, said Gole, who was on duty from 6am to 10am, was found dead at around 8 in the morning. “A constable of Nepal Police was found dead inside a toilet of the parliament building,” Mainali told the Post. “Preliminary investigation shows he was inflicted with a gunshot.”Nepal police said the investigation is underway. \nPolice on Friday arrested two people from Thimi of Bhaktapur for allegedly mining cryptocurrency.The Central Investigation Bureau took 50-year-old Biswas Gurung and Rajendra Tahamata, 25, into custody in connection with the crime, said Hobindra Bogati, spokesperson for the bureau.The duo allegedly ran mining operations from the CTEVT’s information technology lab using a server and 64 desktops, on which blockchain applications were found during a preliminary investigation. Further investigation into the matter is underway. \nOn May 28, presenting the financial plan for the upcoming fiscal year, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun said all the 77 districts of the country are now connected by the national road network.But the ground reality is different.Without a bridge over the Karnali river at Chuwa Khola of Kharpunath rural municipality, Simkot, the district headquarters of Humla, remains to be connected to the national road network. Villagers in the northwestern corner of Nepal bordering Tibet in China where the Humla Karnali crosses face hardships in the absence of one bridge.Though the track was opened to Simkot in mid-April, the construction of the bridge has yet to be completed. As a result, a 12 km section still needs to be completed to connect the district headquarters.Now, vehicles carrying goods along the Karnali Corridor can only reach Kharpu. From there, the goods have to be transported by helicopters and carried over the river using cables, resulting in additional costs. This method, however, is possible only when the water level is low. Due to the lack of a bridge, around ten vehicles bought for government offices and passenger service via Surkhet were taken across the river using ropes and a bulldozer. The cars are now operating on the Simkot side.In 2007-08, the government announced in the annual budget that it would connect Simkot to the national road network. However, even after a decade and a half, Simkot is not connected to the national road network.In September 2021, the joint venture of Swachchhanda, Mount, and Pumori was awarded the Rs110 million contract for the bridge. The construction companies were issued Rs11 million in advance, and the project completion deadline was fixed in March this year.However, the company did not start the construction work for a long time, and around a year ago, it was necessary to change the design.“The joint venture company was responsible for constructing a 55-metre-long motorable truss bridge. But when the contractor started to dig the foundation, a hot water spring was found,” said Bel Bahadur Nepali, chief of the Simikot-Hilsa Road Construction Project. “The assessment showed that the bridge will not be durable if it is constructed on the existing design. So, we made the new design, which got approved two weeks ago. We will start the bridge construction work in July.”Nepali said that with the change in design, the contractor has been given a new deadline to complete the project: August 2025.Binod Kumar Pokharel, chief district officer, said the locals have demanded a Bailey or portable bridge as it may take time to complete the project. “Due to the lack of a bridge, the travellers are facing hassles. The passenger and goods transport charges too are high.”Pokharel said the river's flow is high throughout the year, so vehicles must be towed across the river with the help of an earthmover to Simkot. “To solve the problem, the locals have demanded a Bailey bridge. We are assessing the need.”Until last year, vehicles were operated from Khulalu of Kalikot towards Mugu-Bajura-Sillisalla of Humla. Nepali said that the 39 km road track was opened this year. This year, a 39-kilometre stretch was added. The project opened 8 km of the total track, and the Nepal Army did the work on the remaining 9 km section. The road from Khulalu of Kalikot to the Chinese border is 268 km long. Of this, 95 km south of Simkot is served by transportation. However, as the vehicle flow is breached by the lack of a bridge, passengers from Simkot to Khapunath rural municipality must change the vehicle by crossing suspension bridges on foot.Dan Bahadur Shahi, a senior citizen, said since there is no bridge, vehicles are charging higher fares. Jeeps run on the 12km Simkot-Kharpu stretch. The vehicle operators charge Rs700 to Rs1,000 per person as fare for a special arrangement called “reserve”. In similar fashion, the jeep operated from Kharpu via Sillisalli to Surkhet charges Rs7,000 per person, he said.“We are compelled to change the vehicle as there is no bridge. While crossing the river using the suspension bridge, we need to pay wages to a porter,” Shahi said. “If there were a bridge, we would be able to reach Surkhet by a single vehicle, and the fare would be less.”The price of daily consumable goods in Simkot is sky high, too. “No goods-carriers operate here; small jeeps are permitted to carry passengers only. This means we have to transport goods using porters so the prices refuse to come down,” said Bhim Bahadur Rokaya, a trader at Simkot.“There is no chance of prices falling unless a bridge is constructed across the Kharpu river, allowing for goods to be ferried by trucks,” Rokaya said.Pokharel said that because route permits are issued only from Khulalu of Kalikot to Sillisalli, fares are not fixed. “We have directed the Transport Management Office, Jumla, to manage the route permit and fare. The decision will be taken soon by a meeting of the transportation management committee.” \nTrouble is brewing for Nepal Airlines after no bidders appeared to buy the Chinese planes in multiple round auctions.The six condemned planes—four 17-seater Y12e aircraft and two 56-seater MA60 aircraft—were acquired between 2014 and 2018 and were worth Rs6.66 billion in grants and loans. One crashed in Nepalgunj.The five planes have been grounded at the remote parking bay on the eastern side of Tribhuvan International Airport in Kathmandu since 2020 and are gathering rust.In July 2020, the board of directors of Nepal Airlines unanimously decided to stop flying the Chinese planes as they cost more money to operate than they brought in.Nepal Airlines twice issued notices to lease them out on September 14, 2022, but no one was interested.Then, Nepal Airlines decided to get rid of them permanently.On January 19, the airline requested proposals for a full appraisal of the two MA60 and three Y12e aircraft. An American company that did the appraisal valued the aircraft at Rs220 million.But fearing selling the aircraft at junkyard price may attract the anti-graft body’s interest, Nepal Airlines management decided to do a separate internal assessment.As per the Nepal Airlines value, the asking price of the MA60s, with registration mark 9N-AKR, was $8,225,501; for 9N-AKQ, it was $4,922,235.Similarly, the asking price for Y12e, with registration mark 9N-AKV, was $2,412,671, 9N-AKT was valued at $2,358,860 and 9N-AKS at $1,658,517.In contrast to the valuation made by the American company, Nepal Airlines set the asking price of five Chinese planes at $19,577,784 (Rs2.60 billion).Now, Nepal Airlines is determined to give one last try to auction the Chinese planes. Officials are working tirelessly, and they believe a successful third attempt is possible, despite the challenges. Failing to get the bidders on the third attempt would put the national carrier under pressure to sell them at scrap value, but the team is not giving up.“We are in the process of starting a fresh auction. This will be the third attempt,” said Devendra Pun, spokesperson (technical) for Nepal Airlines.“There will be a new evaluation of the aircraft rates, and we are hopeful of a positive outcome,” said Pun. The sale of these planes could mark a new beginning for the airline, reducing some financial burden they are responsible for.After spending $20,000 on the international appraisal report, there will be little appetite for another appraisal. Pun said he is unsure whether Nepal Airlines would hire another international appraiser or do it internally.The management had tabled the proposal to auction the planes for the third time at the board on April 2. The board, however, is yet to decide. “The management is carefully considering all options and is committed to making the best decision for the future of Nepal Airlines,” said Pun.Nepal Airlines officials say the grounded planes have been more trouble than they are worth.Operating the aircraft was a massive financial strain, exacerbated by breakdowns and a lack of pilots. The company is in great distress, saddled with a debt totalling nearly Rs50 billion.Officials said the Chinese-made aircraft had turned into white elephants right after they arrived. They doubt anyone will buy them.The national flag carrier put the Chinese planes up for lease on September 14, 2022. Prospective bidders were given an October 31 deadline. As there were no bids, the deadline was extended until November 16. There were still no takers, and the management decided to sell them off.The MA60 is a turboprop-powered airliner produced by China’s Xi’an Aircraft Industrial Corporation. Both manufacturers are subsidiaries of the Aviation Industry Corporation of China (AVIC), a government undertaking.The Y12e is a twin-engine turboprop utility aircraft built by Harbin Aircraft Industry Group, previously Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation.Except for flying to a few airports in the Tarai, these aircraft spent more time on the ground than in the air, even during operating hours.Before the planes were grounded, the total accumulated losses of these planes came to Rs1.9 billion, nearly half of their cost.A brief report submitted to the tourism ministry shows that the airline is paying insurance, parking and regular check-up charges for the grounded planes. Nepal Airlines signed a commercial agreement with China AVIC in November 2012 to procure six aircraft—two MA60s and four Y12es.China provided grant and concessional loan worth 408 million Chinese yuan (Rs6.67 billion) to purchase the six aircraft.Of the total aid, a grant of 180 million yuan (Rs2.94 billion) went to pay for one MA60 and one Y12e aircraft, and a 228 million yuan (Rs3.72 billion) loan was used to purchase an MA60 and three Y12e aircraft.As per the agreement, the Nepal government has to pay 1.5 percent annual interest, a service charge, and management expenses amounting to 0.4 percent of the overall loan taken by the Ministry of Finance.The ministry, in turn, would charge Nepal Airlines an annual interest of 1.75 percent on the disbursed loan amount.As per the November 2012 agreement, China gave Nepal Airlines a seven-year grace period during which it would not have to pay interest or instalments. The planes have completed the seven-year grace period.The loan’s payback period is 20 years or by March 21, 2034. Nepal received the first batch of planes in 2014. However, due to issues with the first batch, the delivery of the rest was stalled for years.The second batch of MA60 and Y12e aircraft arrived in January 2017 as part of the six-aircraft deal between Nepal and China.The corporation received the final two Y12e aircraft in February 2018. The finance ministry owns the planes, and Nepal Airlines operates them.In 2014, marking the beginning of what was supposed to be a new era for Nepal Airlines after acquiring the planes, it had even changed its classic red and blue stripes livery, opting for a more modern design. But these planes never brought happiness and money, said officials.Nepal Airlines—known more for its poor service, planes being grounded most of the time and frequent management changes—has been eviscerated by politicking.Every time a new management team or tourism minister comes in, the process of replacing the Chinese planes with new Western-made regional turboprops begins.A few months ago, a committee headed by the former governor of Nepal Rastra Bank Deependra Bahadur Kshetry suggested selling Nepal Airlines’ Rs4.5 billion worth of shares in Soaltee Hotel to buy new planes for domestic use. \nThree months after Indian citizens were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones in Nepal, the central bank on Thursday permitted Nepali citizens to use a quick response (QR) code payment system in India.In a Thursday circular, Nepal Rastra Bank said it has allowed merchant payment using QR codes and other payment mediums like e-banking, interbank payment, and mobile banking in India and Bhutan.The daily transaction limit for merchant payment is Rs15,000 or Rs100,000 per month. A merchant transaction refers to any payment made by a customer to a business or seller. The service has been opened only for goods and service payments in India.With Nepal’s central bank allowing cross-border payment, Nepali payment system operators say they would begin the service in India soon.In a separate circular, the central bank said that Nepali companies involved in digital cross-border payment systems should get prior approval from Nepal Rastra Bank to sign a memorandum of understanding with foreign partners. “We were allowed to receive the payment by the Indian citizens using QR codes in Nepal. Now, the new provision has allowed the banking and financial institutions associated with Fonepay to make payments using QR codes through their respective mobile banking apps in India,” said Paras Kunwar, Chief Operating Officer (COO) of Fonepay. “We will soon begin the service for Nepalis in India.”“Besides a few document works, we are technically ready,” Kunwar said.Starting March 1, Indians were allowed to make payments through their mobile phones. The development was hailed as a milestone in cross-border digital payment between Nepal and India, facilitating the students and people going to India for medical purposes.Nepal’s Fonepay Payment Service has partnered with India’s NPCI International Payments to launch the cross-border payment service using quick response (QR) codes.According to officials, Nepal’s central bank has introduced a retail payment switch to facilitate person-to-person transactions. Nepal Clearing House, a public limited company, can also transact through the retail payment switch.With the delay in implementing the National Payment Switch, the central bank has provisioned a retail switch for inter-country payment through a quick QR code system.On March 15, Nepal Rastra Bank amended the inter-country payment system through QR code guidelines and introduced a provision for Indian workers in Nepal who have accounts in Nepali banks to send money through e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking, and QR code to Indian banks and financial institutions through the national payment switch.However, a circular published on Thursday provisioned sending money through the retail payment switch until the national payment switch comes into full operation.The central bank has set a limit of INR15,000 per day or INR100,000 monthly for person-to-person (P2P) transfers, which are electronic money transfers between individuals through an intermediary.Laxmi Prasad Prasai, director of Nepal Rastra Bank’s payment department, said the national payment switch may take longer.“The national payment switch has not been finalised. Once the switch is completed, the retail payment switch will be routed through it.” National payment switch is the core infrastructure for routing and settlement of retail transactions, ensuring the interoperability of card and non-card-based payments within Nepal. It includes a retail payment switch for handling retail (non-card) based transactions and retail instruments.The retail payment switch is an operational real-time retail payment switch with additional instruments to support virtual private address-based payment, request-to-pay-based pull transactions, interoperable QR, biller gateway, wallet interoperability, and payment system operator settlements.Card switches and domestic card schemes are currently being implemented.While sending remittances from India to Nepal under the ‘Indo-Nepal Remittance Facility Scheme’, Nepali citizens who have accounts in Indian banks and financial institutions can send remittances to Nepal using e-banking, interbank payment, mobile banking and QR codes through retail payment switch.The new guideline issued on Thursday states that remittances sent from India will be available in the Nepali currency in the beneficiaries’ bank account or e-wallet.The central bank’s circular states that the concerned banking and financial institutions and payment service providers need to minimise all risks and maximise the benefits of digital transactions.The new amended guideline provides merchant payment for the sale of goods and services by Nepali traders through QR code and other digital payment modes from Indian payment instruments issued. Nepal’s central bank has already opened the digital payment system for third countries, allowing foreign citizens to pay through a QR code for purchases in Nepal. \nIn June last year, a measles outbreak was reported in Kathmandu’s Gokarneshwar Municipality. Along with Kathmandu of Bagmati Province, the outbreak of the deadly disease was reported in several districts of Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi, and Madhesh provinces.And in less than a year of that outbreak, health authorities concerned have been gearing up to declare the entire Madhesh Province fully immunised.“We are all prepared to declare the Madhesh Province fully immunised,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “All the districts of Madhesh Province have been already declared fully covered, and we have decided to declare the province fully immunised.”To declare an area as fully immunised, all children under 15 months old residing there must be administered all vaccines of the routine immunisation programme.Child health experts doubt the claim that all eligible children of the Madhesh Province have been administered the routine vaccines. They say the decision to declare a fully immunised province could raise a sense of complacency in the public, which will ultimately backfire.“Most of the districts across the country have already been declared fully immunised, and the fact is outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases, including measles, keep getting reported,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “Declaration of a fully immunised province could create a sense of complacency in the public. We also declared the entire country open-defecation-free years ago, but outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea and cholera, have not stopped.”Experts say many districts across the country have already been declared fully literate but it’s hard to believe that all the districts are indeed fully literate.“For the last four months, we have been launching extensive vaccination programmes to achieve the target of a fully immunised province,” said Dr Rajiv Jha, chief of the Provincial Health Directorate of Madhesh Province. “We have also carried out the survey and found 100 percent of children between 15 to 23 months are immunised.”Experts, however, say it is impossible to achieve fully immunised status, as babies are born every hour and every day. Coverage of most health programmes is low in Madhesh Province compared to districts of other provinces. People of certain communities go to maternal homes for child delivery and return months after, and the risk of missing the routine vaccination is high there, according to them.Vaccine coverage is low among people living along the Nepal-India border who keep travelling to India frequently. Most of them opt out of vaccine programmes run by both Nepal and India. Health experts say low vaccination coverage, internal migration, a lack of awareness of importance of vaccines, and government apathy are among the reasons for regular outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.“Due to cross border movements, the trend to go to maternal homes for child delivery, lack of awareness about the importance of vaccination and hygiene and sanitation conditions, risk of children missing routine vaccines is high in Madhesh Province,” said Upreti. “More than the declaration of full immunisation, sustaining that status is very crucial. Childhood vaccination is a continuous process, which never ends, meaning that the target is never achieved.”The Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population, showed that at least four percent of children aged 12 to 23 months have received no vaccination.The number of children missing basic antigens in the routine immunisation programme in Madhesh Province was also staggering. According to the report, the immunisation coverage rate in Madhesh Province is only 68 percent, which means 32 percent of children in the province didn’t take all the vaccines. It is the lowest of all the seven provinces.The government provides 13 types of vaccines through the national immunisation programme. Gandaki Province has a 93 percent vaccine coverage rate, the highest in the country. The vaccine coverage in Sudurpaschim Province, which is considered less developed and less educated, is 89 percent.The vaccination coverage rate is 81 percent in Koshi, 83 percent in Bagmati, 85 percent in Lumbini, and 84 percent in Karnali Province.Immunisation is considered the most cost-effective and efficient way to control and eliminate vaccine-preventable diseases that contribute to childhood illnesses and deaths. \nAt least 1,072 people from across the country have been infected with A(H1N1), also known as the swine flu virus, since January, this year.Data provided by the National Public Health Laboratory shows that 373 others were infected with the influenza B virus, 75 with the A (H3) virus, also known as Hong Kong Flu, 13 with co-infection of swine flu and coronavirus, and two with co-infection of influenza B and coronavirus. What concerns public virologists and infectious disease experts in Nepal is that less than one-fifth of cases of influenza-like illnesses are diagnosed, and neither the doctors attending patients nor the authorities concerned bother to know the real cause of ailments. They say that of the swab samples of 8,739 people with an influenza-like illness, only 1,743 tested positive for various kinds of influenza. “The cause of ailments of the rest of people are not known, which should be a cause of serious concern to the researchers as well as policymakers,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “The criteria for collecting the swab samples for influenza test is that patients should have an influenza-like illness, but only less than one-fifth of samples are testing positive for influenza.”The laboratory only maintains a record of the positive cases but does not tell anything about fatalities due to infections. Experts say the number of people infected with influenza could be several times higher than the data provided by the laboratory, as many people suffering from influenza-like illness do not seek treatment. Even for those who do seek treatment, in most cases, the underlying cause of their ailments often remains undiagnosed. “The next pandemic could also be a pandemic of respiratory viruses,” said Pun. “We will not be able to lessen the risk of outbreaks in future if we continue ignoring the risks. Authorities must step up surveillance and investigate the underlying causes of these ailments.”A recent report by the Nepal Statistics Office also shows that cold and fever remain a significant concern, with an increase from 43.7 percent in 1995/96 to 51. 5 percent in 2022/23.Doctors say more people get infected with viruses during the seasonal changes, as most viruses—adenovirus, rhinovirus, influenza virus, and even coronavirus—become active during these times and winter.But this does not mean respiratory viruses do not spread at other times. “People are getting continuously infected with respiratory viruses in other seasons as well. Those with weak immunity could become more severely affected by the infection,” said Dr Raju Pangeni, a pulmonologist. “Besides urging people to take precautions against these risks, authorities must step up surveillance measures to know the real causes of influenza-like illnesses.”As very few people in Nepal receive flu shots. Experts say unvaccinated elderly people and those with compromised immunity are at risk of severe respiratory virus infections.Doctors say the influenza virus causes respiratory complications, which affect the lungs. It quickly spreads in communities. The diseases can cause fever, cough, body aches, occasional vomiting, diarrhoea and pneumonia.They say that early diagnosis is crucial for preventing infection. Patients recover quickly if treated on time. Both the severity of the disease and the number of deaths increase if seasonal influenza cases are not diagnosed on time, according to experts. \nNineteen-year-old Ekta suffers from excruciating pain during her periods. It is far beyond the usual pain and cannot be managed with medication–she’s tried that multiple times. Taking one dose of Meftal (a period pain medication) is never enough. The pain is debilitating most of the time.Despite several visits to gynaecologists, her complaints have been brushed aside as normal period pains. She strongly feels that her pain is abnormal, but feels powerless to address her issues.“The pain is so bad, but I cannot do anything about it,” she says. “I can’t count the number of times that I’ve been told that my debilitating pain is normal,” bemoans Ekta, whose name has been changed to protect her privacy.The normalisation of period pains means serious reproductive conditions like endometriosis often go untreated. People with endometriosis experience severe pelvic pain because tissues like that found outside the uterus grow inside it. Other symptoms of the condition include heavy bleeding during and between periods and fatigue. There is no known cure for this condition, and symptoms can start from the first period onwards.A major challenge experienced by women with endometriosis is the disregard of their symptoms by the public and medical professionals alike. Due to lack of awareness about the debilitating pain typical to endometriosis, both the person suffering from the condition, and their doctors often underestimate their severity.Severe pelvic pain is a key indicator for diagnosing endometriosis, says Dr Reena Shrestha, a gynaecologist at Madhyapur Hospital. When patients seek consultation regarding the kind of severe pain that significantly disrupts their lives, they may undergo two types of tests: transvaginal ultrasound and diagnostic laparoscopy. These procedures are used to determine the presence of endometriosis. Endometriosis is a complex condition, says Dr Hema Pradhan, a consultant gynaecologist at Everest Hospital. Amongst all the patients she meets at her consultations, many frequently turn out to have endometriosis. But, she’s noticed that often patients often delay seeking treatment because period pains are often normalised.“Women who come to me with their symptoms often delay seeking treatment, because, regardless of the severity of their pain, they believe all period pains to be normal,” says Pradhan.Eighteen-year-old Rima (name change) has been struggling with excessive pain before and during periods for years. She also experiences pain while urinating during her periods. Rima has also been diagnosed with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome (PCOS). The co-occurence of PCOS and endometriosis is not unheard of, although research on them has been minimal.“I can barely walk when I’m on my periods, but I’ve always been told that I should just learn to live with it,” she says.Despite knowing about PCOS, she discovered the possibility of having endometriosis quite later in life. She shares this because period pain, even excessive ones, have been normalised for far too long.The general lack of awareness of endometriosis, and widespread normalisation of period pains, often results in late diagnosis and treatment of the condition.Although there may be no cure to the condition, there are ways to manage its most severe symptoms. Furthermore, receiving a diagnosis can greatly help patients to understand the severity of their condition, according to doctors. “I’m incapable of doing anything during my periods. One time I had to leave the examination in the middle of my exams because of the pain,” says Ekta. “I can’t study, can’t work, all I can do is stay in bed and cry,” she adds.Dr Pradhan reveals another challenging aspect of diagnosing endometriosis. Sometimes the condition may not appear on ultrasound scans initially. Endometrial deposits may appear differently in women due to hormonal changes. Furthermore, symptoms may vary, with some being asymptomatic altogether. According to Dr Shrestha, once a gynaecologist confirms that the patient has endometriosis, they will certainly recommend methods to manage the pain. These include analgesics for pain relief, and home remedies like hot water bag massage.However, the main problem remains. Due to lack of awareness, most patients may only find out about their condition later in life.In some cases women only discover they have endometriosis when they face infertility. Endometriosis is associated with infertility, and 30-50% of people with endometriosis may experience infertility. This also exposes another troubling aspect associated with endometriosis. Ekta shares that her relatives often express concerns about her potential infertility.“They just make me feel bad that I might never get pregnant. And it makes me feel worse,” Ekta adds.Worldwide, endometriosis has been known as a scientifically under-researched condition. It has even been called the ‘missed disease’ because of inconsistencies in its diagnosis and treatment. Endometriosis has also been widely ignored by policy makers.Treatment for endometriosis depends on the individual, says Dr Pradhan. Some are treated with hormonal medication, and others require surgical procedures. The main way to combat endometriosis is timely diagnosis, and timely treatment, she adds.“Raising awareness, timely diagnosis, and treatment are very important,” Dr Pradhan says. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nVenezuela hammered Jamaica 3-0 in Texas on Sunday to seal top spot in Group B and set up a Copa America quarter-final with Canada.Goals from Eduard Bello and Salomon Rondon early in the second half, followed by a late strike from Eric Ramirez, ensured victory for the Venezuelan side.Venezuela had already booked their spot in the last eight with wins over Ecuador and Mexico and needed just a point against already-eliminated Jamaica to clinch top spot and avoid defending champions Argentina in the next round.Jamaica’s best opportunity came in the 21st minute but Renaldo Cephas’ diving header soared over.Bello’s powerful downward header put the South Americans in front in the 49th minute and Rondon doubled their lead seven minutes later with a scuffed effort past Jamaica keeper Jahmali Waite.It was Rondon’s 43rd international goal, extending his record as Venezuela’s highest scorer.Ramirez added Venezuela’s third on the breakaway in the 85th minute, sending a right-footed shot under the advancing Waite after a well-timed pass from Kervin Andrade.Venezuela were joined in the last eight by Group B runners-up Ecuador, who qualified thanks to their superior goal difference after holding Mexico 0-0 in the other match, with both teams tied on four points. \nJude Bellingham rescued England from crashing out of Euro 2024 against Slovakia on Sunday with a stunning 95th-minute equaliser before Harry Kane’s early extra-time winner sent the below-par pre-tournament favourites into the quarter-finals.England were once again poor, looking lethargic and unable to create clear openings, but a moment of magic from Bellingham, who fired home with a bicycle kick, kept them alive before Kane’s header set up a clash with Switzerland in Duesseldorf on Saturday.Slovakia started far sharper than England and gave their opponents several warnings before Ivan Schranz placed a deft finish past goalkeeper Jordan Pickford in the 25th minute.Kane uncharacteristically headed a Foden free kick wide and Declan Rice hit the post as Slovakia were pinned deep in their own half late on, though England seemed to lack belief as their fans grew ever more frustrated.But Bellingham, a day after his 21st birthday, equalised with an incredible effort to take the game to extra time with England’s first shot on target.“What an unbelievable goal, he’s kept our tournament alive,” Kane told ITV, describing Bellingham’s goal as “one of the best in our country’s history”.“You’re 30 seconds away from going home, feeling like you’ve let your nation down, and one kick of the ball and everything’s great,” Bellingham said. “It’s a feeling I don’t want to be in but, when it comes, it’s a great feeling.”England took less than a minute of extra time to take the lead when Kane headed past the despairing Martin Dubravka from close range to complete a remarkable turnaround.Slovakia had faded as the game drew on and went closest to an equaliser of their own just before halftime in extra time, when Peter Pekarik kneed a dangerous cross over the bar.England repelled a late wave of balls into the box to secure a fortunate victory and their progress to the next round, when they will need to be far better against the Swiss who outplayed defending champions Italy in the last-16.The win will not protect England manager Gareth Southgate from criticism, however, after he took 66 minutes to make a substitution despite his side looking bereft of ideas. \nLautaro Martinez struck twice in the second half to help Argentina’s second string beat Peru 2-0 at the Copa America on Saturday and finish top of Group A, knocking Peru out of the tournament.Martinez, featuring in the starting line-up for the first time in the competition, found the net in the 47th and 86th minutes, scoring for a third straight match.The Inter Milan striker finished off a flowing move in the 47th minute, coolly chipping the ball over Peru keeper Pedro Gallese, and repeated the trick in the 86th minute, chipping Gallese again for his second goal after some sloppy defending by Peru.“I’m happy, because I was able to score in the three group-stage games and because I was able to help the team, which is what counts,” Martinez, who was criticised for his performances in Argentina's World Cup-winning campaign in 2022, told TyC Sports.Despite the absence of their coach Lionel Scaloni, suspended and fined for late second-half starts in two previous matches, and a much-changed starting line-up, Argentina were largely untroubled by their opponents.They dominated possession in the first half and had three attempts on target, but Peru’s goalkeeper Gallese kept the scoreline respectable with a string of saves, the most notable of which came from a well-struck free kick by Leandro Paredes in the 26th minute.The defending champions had a gilt-edged chance to extend their lead when they were awarded a penalty for handball in the 72nd minute, but Paredes smashed his spot-kick off the post.Argentina had already qualified for the quarter-finals before the match in Miami with wins over Canada and Chile, the other teams in the group.That security allowed the defending champions to rest key players, including captain Lionel Messi.Messi, who celebrated his 37th birthday on Monday, is recovering from a thigh injury he picked up during their win over Chile on Tuesday. He is expected to return for their quarter-final match on Thursday in Houston against the Group B runner-up.They will be joined in the knockout rounds by group runners-up Canada, who qualified for the last eight after holding Chile to a 0-0 draw in the other Group A match. \nA Russian missile strike hit a nine-storey residential building in the central Ukrainian city of Dnipro on Friday, killing at least one person and injuring 12 others, officials said.Interior Minister Ihor Klymenko warned the death toll would likely rise as more people remained trapped in the building where four upper storeys collapsed as a result of the attack.Later statements from the Interior Ministry said the fire at the site had been extinguished, the remains of one person had been detected underneath the rubble and two people were listed as missing.Regional governor Serhiy Lysak said 12 people had been injured, including a 7-month-old infant. Three people were in severe condition.A photograph published by Lysak on the Telegram messaging app and other images circulated on social media showed a badly damaged building that had smoke rising from a gaping hole in its upper storeys.President Volodymyr Zelenskiy called on Ukraine’s allies to step up supplies of air defences to help the military intercept Russia’s regular aerial attacks.Dnipro, which had a pre-war population of almost one million people, is a major Ukrainian city that lies on the road to the east of the country where the most intense fighting with Russian forces is raging.It has been regularly targeted by missile and drone strikes since Russia launched its February 2022 invasion. Russia denies targeting civilians and civilian infrastructure, but thousands of people have been killed. \nA powerful earthquake of magnitude of 7.0 struck near the coast in southern Peru’s Arequipa region on Friday, local officials said, adding no deaths had been reported.A total of eight people have been injured. The Chief of Disaster Risk Management and National Defense at the Ministry of Health, David Aponte, informed local radio station RPP of three minor injuries. Later, the Ministry of Health reported another five injured people had been treated in hospitals nearby.Following the earthquake, Arequipa was hit by four aftershocks of 4 to 4.6 magnitude, causing some landslides on local roads.The government said on social media it was monitoring to assess the damage and “determine the actions to be taken”.The US National Tsunami Warning Center had said there was a tsunami threat from the quake, adding waves of between 1 and 3 metres (9.84 ft) above the tide level had been recorded along some parts of Peru’s coast.Prime Minister Gustavo Adrianzen, however, said the tsunami warning on the coast of Arequipa had been discarded.Carlos Zanabria, an adviser to the regional government of Arequipa, told local radio station RPP, material damage had been reported in some districts and residents had left their homes in fear, but he had heard no reports of death or injury.Flavio Aranguren, the mayor of Yauca district in Arequipa’s Caraveli province, told RPP some walls of houses in the district had collapsed. He also said no fatalities had been reported.Small artisanal gold mines operate in the town of Yauca and other neighboring towns near the coast, but there was no information available so far about any impact.Ricardo Guillen, representative of the National Emergency Operations Center, said that there have been power and telephone line outages in areas near the epicenter of the earthquake.Ecuador and Peru are part of the so-called Pacific Ring of Fire, an extensive area that surrounds the Pacific Ocean where clashes between the continental plates are frequent. \nA roof collapsed under heavy rainfall and winds at the main airport in India’s capital New Delhi on Friday, killing one person and leading to the cancellation of flights from a domestic terminal, officials said.A portion of the canopy at the departure area of Delhi airport’s Terminal 1 collapsed early in the morning and flight operations were shut down until 2 p.m. (0830 GMT), India’s aviation minister told reporters.The entire terminal, one of three at the country’s busiest airport, has been evacuated and an inquiry ordered into the collapse, said the minister, Kinjarapu Rammohan Naidu.At least 10 flights were cancelled and 40 were delayed, according to data from flight tracking platform Flightradar24.Eight injured people were taken to hospital and the rescue operation had been completed, said Atul Garg, the director of Delhi Fire Service.Visuals from Indian TV channels showed a taxi crushed under a wrecked metal pillar at the entrance area of the terminal, which is mostly used by low-cost carriers IndiGo and SpiceJet (SPJT.BO), opens new tab for domestic flights.Indigo is operated by Interglobe Aviation (INGL.NS), opens new tab.The incident happened at 5 a.m. (2330 GMT Thursday), usually a busy time for domestic flights carrying people across the country, a statement from the airport posted on X said.The airport area received about 148.5 millimetres of rain over three hours in the early morning, more than the average for all of June, according to India’s weather office.Many other parts of Delhi were flooded as well and cars trapped in thigh-deep water. Metro services were affected and traffic snarls were reported from several parts of the city.Several residents in Delhi also complained of power cuts.In India’s most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, at least 20 people died in various rain and flood-related incidents in the last 48 hours, including seven due to lightning strikes, officials said.GMR Airports Infrastructure (GMRI.NS), which operates Delhi International Airport, is also its top shareholder with a 64% stake. Its shares fell as much as 2.1% in early trade. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nLast week, in a surprise development likely weeks in the planning, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange was able to leave the United Kingdom for the first time in more than a decade after reaching a plea deal with the US government.In the past several months, momentum has been building towards this moment. There was increasing bipartisan support in both the Australian parliament and the US Congress for the Australian citizen’s release. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has made repeated statements on his behalf, and in April, US President Joe Biden said he was “considering” a request from Australia to drop its prosecution of Assange.This all contributed to the sense the matter might be resolved before Assange’s final UK hearing date, previously scheduled for July 9 and 10. The timing of the deal is also a welcome prelude to Albanese’s potential visit to Washington in early July.The United States’ pursuit of Assange has seemingly been relentless since WikiLeaks posted hundreds of thousands of classified military documents in 2010. It wasn’t until 2019 under then President Donald Trump, however, that he was finally indicted on 17 counts of violating the 1917 Espionage Act.The charges against Assange were not just considered unprecedented, they raised significant First Amendment concerns.The apparent desire to punish Assange for the embarrassment caused by the leaks—and to deter others from taking similar action—was so strong the CIA allegedly discussed plans to kidnap and even assassinate Assange during the Trump administration, according to US media reports.In the UK courts, the US Department of Justice had argued Assange should be subject to US law and extradited to face trial for his actions. However, as a non-citizen, there were questions over whether he could rely on the legal protections afforded by those same laws—particularly the constitutional right to free speech.The successful extradition of Assange could have set a precedent by which the US could pursue journalists anywhere in the world for publishing information it did not like, while potentially denying them their fundamental First Amendment rights.In a crucial election year in the US that President Joe Biden is framing as an existential fight for the soul of US democracy, the continued pursuit of Assange was as inconsistent as it was ultimately untenable. Viewed from the outside, it appeared the case was causing the Biden administration international embarrassment.Biden has been careful to maintain an appropriate distance between the presidency and the Department of Justice. He came into office promising to restore faith in the rule of law following the Trump years and has meticulously avoided any appearance of interference in the department’s work as it has investigated and indicted his predecessor.Assange’s case, however, is wholly different to the charges on which Trump has been indicted. It is certainly possible to interpret Biden’s comment that he was “considering” dropping the charges as a gentle public rebuke of the Department of Justice’s pursuit of the case, given its global implications for a free press.The continued pursuit of Assange was also becoming problematic in the context of Australia’s alliance with the US. That relationship is always described as one based on shared democratic values, in contrast to what Biden has repeatedly framed as the coercive and repressive instincts of “authoritarian” powers.The decision by the US to pursue a citizen of one of its closest allies for the publication of information, while simultaneously condemning authoritarian states for doing much the same, was both hypocritical and damaging to American standing in the world.In the context of growing concern in Australia about the terms of the AUKUS submarine deal and the Australian government’s willingness to go “all-in” with the US militarily, the continued pursuit of Assange gave the impression that Australia’s most important security ally did not take its concerns seriously. Australia appeared simply to be snapping at America’s heels.It also added to the sense that the “capital-A Alliance” between the two countries was increasingly dominated by security concerns, often at the expense of democratic accountability.Because of the international campaign to free Assange and the support it received in both Australian and American democratic institutions, there appears to be have been a reconsideration of this focus on security interests over democratic values.It should be noted, though, that the US didn’t drop its prosecution in the end; Assange has agreed to plead guilty to a felony charge of violating the Espionage Act, which in itself may set a concerning precedent for press freedom.And the fact this saga happened at all—and that it has taken more than a decade to get close to resolution—should prompt deep reflection on the values that underpin both Australia’s relationship with its most important security ally and the United States’ role in the world.-The Conversation  \nNepal’s membership in the World Trade Organization (WTO), a multilateral trading system, marked 20 years in April 2024. After 14 years of an arduous accession process that began in 1989, the fifth WTO Ministerial Meeting in 2003 approved Nepal's membership, and the country formally joined the organisation in April 2004 after the government ratified it. Nepal had two main reasons to enter into the multilateral trading system, despite its complexities. First, it was indispensable for Nepal to fill the void in its external trade caused by the termination of its trade and transit agreements with India, which shared almost 90 percent of the country’s external trade at that time. Second, the multilateral trading system could help diversify Nepal’s India-dominated external trade with third countries, as stipulated in its plans and policies until the late 80s. Nepal’s objectives in joining the WTO were to guarantee transit rights and trade diversification under non-discriminatory treatment in trade with its partners, as assured by the basic norms of the multilateral trading system. However, Nepal’s affiliation to the WTO can also be evaluated for other reasons. When Nepal joined the WTO, the WTO Doha Round of trade negotiations, initiated in 2001 (yet to be concluded), was at the centre of global attention because it embraced the interests of both developed and developing countries. The Doha Round has special bearings for Nepal. Renowned for the understanding to cut agriculture subsidies and tariffs as well as to improve market access for non-agriculture products, the essence of the Doha Round for the least-developed countries (LDCs), including Nepal, rested on the introduction of preferential market access for the first time under the multilateral system. It was later incorporated into the Doha agenda as a duty- and quota-free programme. The agenda included trade capacity building provision through the Aid for Trade programme to compensate for trade losses of such countries due to the erosion of preference as world average tariff rates are reduced under the multilateral system. This suggested that the value of trade preference would diminish with the erosion of preference margins for Nepal’s trade, whereas the preference would gradually lose its importance after Nepal graduates from LDC status in 2026. The LDC-specific preference is not permitted for non-LDCs under different preferential schemes, including the popular Generalised System of Preference programme. Thus, Nepal’s fate in the WTO will eventually depend on its trade efficiency and trade policy rather than the preferential treatment. Nepal must do many things to reap the benefits of its WTO membership. First and foremost, it is necessary to assess our bilateral trade agreements vis-à-vis the country’s current trade regime, which is already under the multilateral system. Except for the trade treaty with India, Nepal’s other bilateral agreements seem redundant in this context. Nepal’s trade agreement with India includes partially reciprocal trade preferences at its core and goes deeper than the multilateral system. However, the rest of the others are confined to the most favoured nation (MFN) treatment concerning customs tariffs and trade procedures, almost equivalent to the WTO’s MFN treatment or the principle of trade without discrimination. That means such agreements are superfluous unless they have distinctive features from the WTO system. Therefore, Nepal should revise the bilateral agreements, giving due consideration to the issues that do not fall under the WTO mechanism. For example, the bilateral trade negotiations could be an effective means to sort out the problem of non-tariff measures (NTMs), which are intense in Nepal’s trade enhancement and diversification initiative. The NTMs have been problematic even during the WTO negotiations. Paradoxically, the domestically ingrained NTMs are more detrimental to Nepal’s trade endeavour than the non-tariff barriers subjected to its trade with partners, according to a study by the International Trade Centre. In addition to the challenges, there is a rationale behind Nepal’s membership in the WTO. One of the most significant aspects is the predictable trading environment guaranteed by the WTO principles, which are based on non-discrimination, fair trade and transparency. Furthermore, in the case of unfair trade practices, the WTO has contingency measures, such as anti-dumping and countervailing duties, to defend the country’s trade interests from such incidents. And there is a powerful dispute settlement mechanism at its disposal to sort out the trade wrangling, if any. These measures are worthwhile as the country’s trade expands.It is worth mentioning some achievements Nepal made after entering the WTO. Backed by the policy of free trade, Nepal’s exports have grown steadily in the face of escalated import trade since it pursued the multilateralism policy. The liberalisation of import trade has helped the country diversify its exports through comparative advantage. Nepal’s achievement in the area of service trade cannot be undermined with respect to export prospects and diversification. Besides these accomplishments, Nepal has also made strides in trade-related laws. While the rules on intellectual property rights—one of the strict WTO requirements—have been introduced, the laws dealing with competition and anti-dumping, which are prerequisites to international business, are also effective now. However, this is not the end of the challenges. Nepal’s benefits from WTO membership will rely on its dedication to an enabling trading environment. This will also depend on its ability to adapt to the multilateral trading system, which is facing a credibility crisis following the Doha deadlock and the growing threat of protectionism in recent years.           \nSEE results reveal a dismal 47.86% pass rate, with 52.14% of students failing and highlighting the urgent need for a complete overhaul of the teaching-learning system in Nepal.\nJulian Assange, famed for releasing classified documents through WikiLeaks, was released from prison after 14 years of legal battles involving asylum and incarceration.\nHaphazard road construction and riverbed extraction in Nepal pose environmental risks, including flooding and landslides, despite legal prohibitions and government apathy.\nClimate change is shifting the distribution and severity of diseases and natural disasters in Nepal, with deadly snakes reaching mountainous districts and dengue spreading widely, requiring urgent upgrades to infrastructure and understanding.\nIndia's recent recall of Nepal's ambassador, the progress of trade agreements with China under BRI, and the outcomes of Prime Minister Dahal's Delhi visit highlight Nepal's diplomatic relations and the importance of establishing a rational system for ambassadorial appointments.\nThe government has decided to make the National ID Card mandatory in order to receive services from government and public institutions. In the first phase, the June 6 Cabinet meeting made the National ID card number mandatory in 28 districts. People including federal lawmakers criticised the decision saying that it was enforced without first distributing the cards. In this context, Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Yubaraj Katel, director general of the Department of National ID and Civil Registration.Let’s begin with a basic question. Why do we need a National ID card while we already have citizenship certificate, driving license, passport and voting card?There is a fundamental difference between a citizenship card and National ID. Citizenship establishes whether you are a citizen of the country and it helps you identify yourself with some basic details. In Nepal, it was also widely used as a service card. Wherever you go, you have to show the citizenship card—to open a bank account or acquire a SIM card for a phone. If we study international practices, there are mainly two cards—one is an identity card and the other is a service card. In 2018, the Nepal government came up with the idea of distributing national identity cards with a unique digital number for each eligible citizen. The number can track not only the individual but also the person’s activities and movements. This project has various components. First is data collection. It has two categories—demographic data, such as the names of father, mother and other family members. Second is biometric data—fingerprints, eye retina and digital signature. The biometric data is crucial to create a unique identity of each individual and avoid duplication in the integrated national database. The National ID has these two types of data. The other tasks are enrollment of the data, printing and distribution of the cards and then providing services based on that. At present, people carry multiple cards in their pockets. The objective of this project is to replace all of them by a single card–National ID. The new card includes vital details of all other cards in its chip with 1GB storage capacity. The government wanted to trace people based on their unique individual numbers so that there is no need to print and carry multiple cards. There is a huge industry of printing separate cards for each and every service that is creating a jumble of information. The National ID will not only replace multiple cards but also help authorities control criminal activities like financial frauds by removing duplication. At present, government authorities have difficulty in tracing and identifying an individual and wrongdoers are benefitting from that situation.What cards will be replaced by the National ID?It has a chip with 1GB storage capacity where you can store your driving license, academic documents, voting card, insurance details, ATM card number, etc. For instance, if you go to a telecom company to acquire a SIM card, they will ask for a copy of your citizenship card. You can say, ‘no, I have a National ID card’. Once you give your number and fingerprint, they can immediately verify it through the system. Another objective is to help people get rid of filling up pages of forms for each service. International governance has a norm that says don’t ask citizens their information more than once. A state agency should seek the information once and provide it to other state agencies if they require it. People complain that many agencies don’t accept National ID. They still ask for a citizenship card for official record and verification. So, in practice, it didn’t help people reduce the number of cards in their pockets. In fact, it added one more.Therefore, the June 6 Cabinet decision made the use of National ID cards compulsory in 28 districts. Now, it is going to be essential to get social security allowances, pensions and claim health insurance. The Health Insurance Board has said it has become challenging for them to verify whether a claimant is the rightful one. The board has 8 million policyholders. We will give them our details. Then, they can cross-check the authenticity of a claimant. This will help avoid huge financial frauds. In fact, the government should have made it mandatory earlier.But people including lawmakers in the federal parliament have strongly opposed the decision saying that the government made National ID mandatory without first distributing the cards to the people.Nepal’s total population is over 30 million. Our principal stakeholders are citizenship card holders. Those 16-year-olds are eligible for citizenship cards. The Election Commission distributes voting cards to those above 18 years. We got the data from the commission and added 20 percent and estimated that we have 18.6 people above 16 years old. As of Friday, we have already distributed the National ID numbers to 14.9 million people. Now, as per our estimate, around 3.7 million people are yet to get the National ID. Millions of people are abroad. Thus, we are headed towards saturation point in terms of data collection and issuance of the numbers. One thing I want to stress is that people don’t need a hard copy of the National ID card. The number is sufficient. Printing cards is costly. We have to pay around 2 euro to procure a blank card. The cost of printing, delivery and other overhead expenses is added to that. With the task of printing over a billion copies of ID cards being too costly, even India discourages use of hard copy of the cards. You can create the QR code of your card, save it in your mobile or print it in a paper and scan it wherever you need it.Officials at our government agencies bring up the rule that makes it mandatory to present a physical copy of citizenship card or other documents for official works.Yes, we are trained and habituated in that way. Now we need to change. We must make offices paperless while developing a strong database system. We have been using citizenship cards to verify the identity of a person for a long time. Biometrics not only helps identify people but also trace their activities. Recently, Rs2 billion was found in the bank accounts of a 26-year-old man. The money was deposited in 56 bank accounts. He used 13 ATM cards and 17 phone numbers. Once the National ID card is implemented, transactions and movements of such wrongdoers will be easily traced and monitored. Identifying individuals accurately is crucial to ensure good governance and strengthen security. Many people have acquired fake citizenship cards. People even made fake passports. Implementation of National ID will control it. It is also related to our national image. It will help improve the status of our passport and add authenticity to our other documents as well.Once the National ID comes into wide use, our details will be traced and used by multiple agencies. State agencies and other institutions benefit from the integrated database as they can easily trace us. But how do you ensure our data isn’t misused and it doesn’t make us insecure?If you have a National ID card, you don’t need a hard copy of your driving licence. There is a backlog of around 2.1 million licences. The government has failed to print and distribute them. We told them, we have already procured 12 million cards. Of them, 3.2 million cards have already been printed and we still need to print around 8 million cards. Once the licence data is integrated with the National ID card, it will be shown there. Now, to come to your question, only the traffic authority can access the licence-related data. The device they use will trace only relevant data. Only an authorised agency will get access to the data and it can’t be used for anything other than the stated purpose. We give access to agencies like Nepal Rastra Bank, Nepal Telecommunication Authority and Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal. Then they regulate the things in their domain. No unauthorised body or individual can access it. Do the implementing agencies have infrastructure to use this technology?We are in a position to implement it in some parts of the country. Therefore, we are implementing it in phases. We are making it mandatory for certain services in 28 districts from mid-July. We should have started much earlier. It must be expedited.Lawmakers said in a Parliament meeting that the decision has ‘terrorised people’ in the 28 districts as locals feared they might be deprived of the services as the government has made National ID cards mandatory without first distributing them.We started the National ID registration process from 2018. Registration teams reached in each local ward except in Mugu and Humla districts of Karnali. It was carried out as a campaign. Even after the drive’s completion, the registration process was open in all the 77 districts, 54 area administration offices and in palika (local unit) centres. We also had registration centres in major downtowns. We receive data of around 4,000 registrations a day. So, there has been sufficient initiative and enough time to encourage people to get the number. Besides, if anyone in the 28 districts are still to get the ID number, they still have three months to register.You said only an ID number but no hard copy was needed to access any kind of service, right?Exactly. There is no provision that states one should produce a hard copy to get any service. You give the number and your biometrics to verify that you are the right person. Then, the official can crosscheck it in the database within seconds.Do all the implementing agencies have the devices that read the National ID cards?We have distributed 4,200 machines that read the cards in 333 local units of the 28 districts. Likewise, we have asked other local units and districts and some agencies such as banks to procure the devices and we have given the specifications based on their requirements. A device costs just around Rs 1,500. You can enter the number and place your thumbprint on it. We have trained relevant officials from all the local units for the purpose.How many cards can the department print at present?We can produce 1,500 cards an hour. But now we are producing only 1,800 a day. We have the strength to distribute 30,000 cards a day but are distributing only 5,000 a day.Again the same question. Then why are people not getting the cards?There is some communication gap. People who registered in 2018 or 2019 haven’t contacted us. We are giving them priority to clear the backlogs. But people who are newly-registered are showing more interest. So, we need to strike the right balance.When will the department be in a position to distribute the cards to all the people?At present, we can print 100,000 cards a month. We have a space to double the capacity. Meanwhile, people have now shown more interest. By enhancing our facilities’ capacity, we can print the pending 8 million cards in the next 40 months.What about election cards? Do we need to register for that and get the voting cards?In fact, the Election Commission doesn’t need to collect data and issue cards. We will talk to them. As a constitutional body, we have to readily make the data available for them. In fact, the National ID Card system can help the commission make voting arrangements for the Nepalis abroad because it can accurately identify the right person and can immediately update the integrated system here in Nepal about the votes cast in any country. This card will be helpful in conducting fair elections because the biometric data stored in this system will be perfect bases to identify the people and instantly update the activities in the database.You have emphasised replacement of other cards by the National ID cards. How long may it take to do so?We plan on giving priority to three sectors—banking, civil aviation and telecom. People right now need to fill separate forms for these services that have irked the service seekers. We have asked the bankers to buy the devices. We as a supplier are ready. Now the stakeholders should be ready too. It will benefit them because it helps control frauds.What if I don’t register for the National ID card?In the first place, you will be deprived of social security funds, pension, insurance policies. Likewise, the government will gradually make the card compulsory to receive many other services such as driving licence, land transaction, telephone numbers, bank accounts. How do you assure that our data stored in this system isn’t misused?See, the current practices make you more vulnerable. Because multiple agencies take your data for various purposes. Do they have a system to protect the data and ensure that it isn’t misused? But when your data is stored only by a dedicated government agency, it will be more secure as the agency is specialised for that. When other authorised agencies seek data, we give them access only to the relevant one. We have a National Identity Management Information System (NIMIS). We have maintained three layers of security—L1, L2, L3—to ensure foolproof security of the data. There are three servers.Are we dependent on any foreign company for any related service?So far, only one international vendor is involved but we are cutting down its involvement as well, with a plan to ultimately replace it by our own agency. The vendor now helps transfer collected data to the printing machine through the Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). But our plan is to do so through our own government agency or local vendor. We do all the other tasks. Security printing is done within the office basement where every movement of people is monitored and recorded. \nPrithvi Subba Gurung, deputy general secretary of the CPN-UML, is one of the leaders who strongly lobbied for a federal system while the Constituent Assembly was writing the constitution between 2008 to 2015. Eight years after the adoption of the federal democratic republican constitution, the federal system, particularly the provinces, are widely being criticised for their supposed failure to deliver. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks former Gandaki chief minister Gurung what went wrong in the course of implementing the federal system.The implementation of the federal system has faced several hurdles since its adoption. Most provinces have for months failed even to form the governments, let alone run them efficiently. Where is the problem?We have adopted a federal system but are working against its spirit. Provinces should run autonomously. On some key issues, federal leaders and the party’s central bodies may give some direction to their provincial bodies. But most provincial activities are still centrally-governed even years after the adoption of federalism. So, our practices aren’t in line with the system. The provincial governments shouldn’t have been affected by the changes in the federal coalition. Such problems were seen in India years ago. But they have learned from their experience. In our case, leaders of major political parties treated the provincial governments as party chapters. The provincial governments are formed and run as per the constitution and all the three tiers of the governments are autonomous. The high commands in our political parties aren’t ready to accept the new constitutional setup.Are the provincial leaders equally responsible as they seek Kathmandu’s nod before taking any important decisions?They seek the centre’s support because they are trained in that way. They are too dependent on the centre. You said India learned by experience and now provinces there work more autonomously. But, in Nepal, provinces are now witnessing more problems than during their first tenure, which is evident also in the difficulties in government formation in multiple provinces. Why couldn’t they learn from the five-year experience?Nepal’s leaders and political parties are still not committed to federalism. They have failed to implement the federal system as per the spirit of the constitution. This is the major problem. The big parties as well as their leaders are guided by a centralised mindset and still prefer working in a unitary system. We should not forget that we transformed the executive and legislative bodies into three tiers of federal systems. But our judiciary retained the old structure. Therefore, the judiciary doesn’t accept the federal system and its practice in a true sense. Its verdicts reflect the same.The role of Speakers and Province Heads has courted controversies in multiple provinces. The top court invalidated some of their decisions. Is it because of lack of clarity, faults in our constitutional provisions, or is it because of the leaders?Speaker and Province Head are political posts created in accordance with constitutional provisions. When overall politics is dirty and unhealthy, those taking up these responsibilities also feel compelled to resort to similar tactics. When overall politics improves, they automatically make better decisions. Mainly there is no leader in the high command who completely owns federalism and is determined to implement it in its true spirit. This government in its policies and programmes unveiled last month had rightly said that “protecting federalism and strengthening the federal democratic republic is our top priority”. But the budget failed to introduce programmes as per the promises made in the policies and programmes.How do we correct these anomalies? Where do we begin?We are in a complex situation. Many have started to float the idea of making amendments to the constitution. But we shouldn’t forget that various forces and stakeholders had their own positions during constitution-making. They made compromises and found middle grounds to promulgate the constitution. If we go for amendments, they all will return to their respective stances. Some may want to revive the Hindu Kingdom while others will stand against it. Some leaders even within Nepali Congress have started to advocate for constitutional monarchy. But we can’t regress to the monarchical system. We can’t renounce secularism and an inclusive democratic system. We can’t backtrack on our commitment to a socialism-oriented system. We may explore some changes in our electoral system or form of governance without going against these key features of our constitution but we can’t destabilise the charter. What are the major flaws to be fixed?There are some. For instance, provinces have no role in education. The responsibility of education up to secondary level is given to the local level. And, everything is controlled by the federal government. The local units are entrusted with key responsibilities such as developing curriculum, overseeing the issues of career developments of teachers and staffers and their promotion as well as transfers etcetera. Local units can’t do all of these things efficiently as they have their own limitations. How can a local unit transfer a teacher from Kaski to Lamjung? Provinces should have been given such responsibilities. The power has been centralised at Singha Durbar. Such is also the situation in other sectors.Though the proportional representation (PR) system is hailed as one of the most beautiful features of our constitution in terms of ensuring inclusion, it has also been blamed for political instability. Many have demanded revision in the electoral system.The major political parties such as the CPN-UML and Nepali Congress have not trained their party members on the proper implementation of key constitutional features such as federalism and electoral system. The party members and general people have either wrongly understood it, or have negative impressions about the systems. These systems were adopted with an objective to resolve our decade-long conflict and address the concerns of the historically marginalised communities and even mainstream some groups through an inclusive democratic system. The idea was to integrate all the communities and maintain unity in diversity. After holding years-long debates on various options, we agreed on the mixed electoral system so as to reflect our diversity in the state agencies.As the proverb goes, “the bad workman blames his tools”, our leaders are blaming the system for their failure to secure a majority by winning people’s trust. Many countries that practise similar electoral systems have progressed. Our electoral system and the form of governance are not causing political instability. Many countries have adopted a parliamentary system and many others have practised the presidential model. Countries have progressed in both the systems. Also, there are examples of failures under both setups. So, the problem lies in our political parties and leaders, not in the systems. Shouldn’t political parties like the UML and Congress work with a plan to secure a majority by winning people’s trust? They aren’t training their focus on that but blaming the system. At times, they have squandered the majority as well and have failed to keep the party intact. Isn’t it our [leaders’] failure?Some argue that the issue of the fractured mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold ceiling for political parties to be eligible to get PR votes and that can be done by amending election laws. Does it help?This is the idea coming from big political parties because they get more votes when fringe parties disqualify for PR votes. But a higher ceiling may deprive many small parties from representing certain communities. So, this goes against the spirit of inclusion. What we need is a good coalition culture. If we see the trend of recent decades, Indian politicians have become much more mature in this context. In the past, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi accommodated his electoral alliance partners in his ruling coalition even though his party won the majority single-handedly. If we scrap the inclusive electoral system, won’t the marginalised communities again revolt? We should be careful about that.At times, leaders have helped dissident groups split their party. These are the same leaders who issued an ordinance to change the provision that required a group within a political party to show support of 40 percent members of the party’s central committee “and” the parliamentary party. Only then could it split. They changed the threshold to 20 percent, and the “and” provision had been changed to “or”. The provision of requiring 40 percent support on both sides had earlier been included to ensure political stability. But the leaders who are helping party divisions are blaming the system for instability in the country. So, we [leaders] have to mend our ways, not blame the system. The Rastriya Swantantra Party, the fourth-largest in the lower house, has officially said that it wants to overhaul the federal system and drastically downsize the provinces. Also, leaders within the major parties who earlier stood in favour of federalism have started criticising it. On Saturday, Congress General Secretary Gagan Thapa said the country can’t sustain the provinces in their present form. What is your view?I am one of those who advocated for a federal system even before the first Constituent Assembly because Nepal is a country full of discrimination based on caste, class, region and religion. We advocated for the system to do away with these discriminations and find a system to maintain unity within diversity. Federalism is the best system to promote national unity as all groups get their own space as per their unique features. For instance, if you make multiple rooms in a building, you can give space and adjust more people. But if you keep many people inside a big room, they will have difficulties—no matter how big the room is. We should strengthen the federal system. We can’t regress.Then, why do many people see provinces as a burden?In Nepal, the federal system was projected as a structure that resulted in huge liability to the state coffers. But the facts don’t substantiate it. A local unit in the federal structure replaced many erstwhile Village Development Committees (VDCs). For instance, in my home district of Lamjung, eight palikas covered the areas of 61 VDCs, and the expenditure of the current eight local units is no more than that of the erstwhile 61 VDCs. Now we don’t need 77 district coordination committees. They can be scrapped. No province needs more than seven ministers. Likewise, the federal Cabinet can be drastically downsized. Why do we need a 25-strong Cabinet at the centre when we already have seven other provincial cabinets? Twelve ministries are enough at the centre, as suggested by the high level commission on administration reform.There are many departments and divisions that were designed under the unitary system that have become completely redundant in the federal setup. So many project offices established over two decades ago based on the needs of that time are still there. These irrelevant bodies should be scrapped. This is how we can significantly cut down on administrative costs. Leaders and people don’t discuss that. They only blame provinces. \nLawmaker Jiban Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nSunday’s weather across the country will be generally to mostly cloudy.Expect light to moderate rain with thunder and lightning in many areas of Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Sudurpashchim provinces.
