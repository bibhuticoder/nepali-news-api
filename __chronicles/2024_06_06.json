Just give me title and no other text. \n I will give you a story and the news events from today. \n    Based on news events continue the story and provide me the updated story. In the story cover all the events as much as possible, try to weave them together, making a beautiful story.\n    Be elaborative as possible. I need more text. Text only no title or headings. Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nMadhesh Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav lost his position on Wednesday, 17 months into his appointment, after failing to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the provincial assembly.A meeting of the provincial assembly rejected the motion tabled by the chief minister seeking the assembly’s trust.Assembly Speaker Ramchandra Mandal announced that of the 103 members present, 50 members of the assembly voted in favour of his motion while 53 voted against. In the 107-strong Madhesh assembly, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a simple majority.The federal coalition of the Maoist Centre, the CPN-UML and the Janamat Party, among others, is set to stake claim to a new government in the province. CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Yuvaraj Bhattarai claimed that although 53 assembly members voted against Yadav on Wednesday, the new coalition has 55 votes in the assembly and its candidate will swiftly win the chief ministership.“Assembly members representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party were absent during the trust vote, but they are with us,” Bhattarai told the Post. The two parties each have an assembly member. With 25 members, the CPN-UML is the largest party in Madhesh provincial assembly, while the Congress is second-largest with 22 members. Likewise, the JSP-Nepal has 19, the Janamat Party 13, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal 9, the CPN (Maoist Centre) 9, the CPN (Unified Socialist) 7 and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, the Nagarik Unmukti Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party one each.Earlier, leaders from the CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) had reportedly agreed to form the provincial government in Madhesh under the leadership of CK Raut-led Janamat party’s provincial assembly leader. On May 30, Janamat Party chair Raut had announced that the federal coalition members including Mahantha Thakur-led Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal would support his party to form the government in Madhesh. However, leaders from Thakur’s party and the Unified Socialist had said they have yet to make an official decision.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, was appointed the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This provision requires a chief minister to undergo a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support.Upendra Yadav’s parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, had been in power in Madhesh Province for nearly seven consecutive years. Yadav formed several parties over the past seven years through splits or mergers. The latest split of Yadav’s JSP-Nepal happened on May 5, when its federal chair Ashok Rai, backed by several senior leaders, launched a new Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission recognised the new party on May 6, compelling Chief Minister Yadav to undergo a floor test as per Article 188 (2) of the Constitution. “If the political party which the Chief Minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition Government withdraws its support, the Chief Minister shall table a resolution in the State Assembly for a vote of confidence within thirty days,” reads the Article of the Constitution. Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly to reschedule the vote for Monday next week, citing his poor health. However, he later agreed to face the assembly due to fear of ‘automatically’ losing the position. Leaders from rival parties had claimed that Yadav would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal if he refused to undergo a floor test. There were also legal questions over the requirement for floor test as the Supreme Court, acting on a petition by Upendra Yadav, has ordered the election body to freeze the registration of the Ashok Rai-led party, until a final verdict.On Wednesday evening, Province Head Sumitra Bhandari invited parties for government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution. The parties have until 10 am Friday to submit their claims. The provision states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the assembly under clause(1), the Province Head shall appoint as the chief minister a member of the assembly who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the provincial assembly.The new chief minister will be required to secure the confidence of the provincial assembly within 30 days of appointment. With Wednesday’s trust vote, Upendra Yadav’s party has been ousted from power six and a half years after the first provincial assembly elections. Previously, Yadav’s aide Lal Babu Raut served a full five-year term as chief minister of the province. \nOn February 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government to allow the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding its legal ownership ceiling with plots in any other place within the Koshi Province.With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about “policy corruption” committed in the process.The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli government’s decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said. \nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nOver a week after its formation, the parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives has started drafting its working procedure necessary to commence the probe.The first meeting of the parliamentary panel on Wednesday tasked the officials of the Parliament Secretariat deputed to the committee with drafting the working procedure by Thursday.“Our meeting on Friday will endorse the working procedure after reviewing the draft by the officials,” Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “We will probably start the investigation from Sunday.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party are the members of the committee.It took over a week since the committee was formed for its first meeting as Thapa was in his home district Pyuthan for some days. Talking to the journalists after the meeting, Thapa said they are committed to completing the investigation within the three-month deadline. “We will work day and night to complete our job within the deadline,” Thapa said.The officials will prepare the working procedure within the framework finalised by the task force led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs.The Giri-led panel had agreed on four terms of reference (ToR) for the probe committee.As per the ToR, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk.Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problematic cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and other companies and organisations.It will also investigate the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in the illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations for recovering the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations.Cooperatives that injected money into Gorkha Media Network are Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.It took weeks for the parties to agree on the ToR for the committee as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after all the cooperatives linked with the Gorkha Media Network were subjected to probe. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will witness the swearing-in of Narendra Modi as Indian prime minister on Saturday.Amrit Rai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed with the Post that Prime Minister Dahal will visit New Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony.Rai said the foreign ministry is finalising the delegates who will travel with the prime minister to the Indian capital city.Modi will assume office as prime minister for a historic third consecutive term after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats in the recent elections. Modi is only the second leader to win a third term after founding Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.In 2014, the then Prime Minister Sushila Koirala attended Modi’s oath-taking ceremony when he was elected prime minister for the first time.The Indian government has invited heads of government from other Saarc countries for the swearing-in ceremony.Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Modi on his election victory on Tuesday.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with Modi.“Happy to speak with PM @cmprachanda. Thanked him for his warm wishes,” Modi said in a post on X. “We reaffirmed our shared commitment to bolster the deep-rooted and multifaceted partnership between India and Nepal, and agreed to sustain the positive momentum in our relations.”Also, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, among other leaders from Nepal, congratulated the Indian leader on his election.  \nIndustrialists on Wednesday said that the provision of advance income tax on food and pulses imposed by the government through the budget would increase prices by at least 30 percent, warning that the country’s inflation may balloon if immediate measures are not taken.Nepal Rice Oil Dal Industry Association, Nepal Flour Industry Association, and Livestock Feed Industry Association held a joint press meeting to criticise the government's move, which they say would not only increase the prices but may also put the food industry on the edge of bankruptcy.This is because the rise in prices in the domestic market will fuel smuggling from bordering towns in India where these products are cheaper, said Kumud Kumar Dugad, president of the Nepal Rice Oil and Dal Industry Association.Through the Financial Bill, the government has provisioned collecting 2.5 percent advance income tax on rice imports and 10 percent on pulse imports.“This is totally irrational. This shows that the government is not serious towards the consumers and sensitive industries like the food industry,” said Dugar. He questioned the rationale behind the advance tax imposed on food imports and the principle of taxation.He said that the price of a bag of rice (25 kg) has increased by Rs100 since the introduction of the advance tax, and the price of pulses has increased by Rs20 per kg.A study titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India’, undertaken by the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, lists rice as a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal.The paper said that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through the formal channel. The research shows that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.India, on the other hand, often bans the export of rice and other food commodities.With this variation, prices in Nepal and India differ by 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Hemraj Dhakal, vice president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the government should withdraw such tax. “The taxation policy has harmed the domestic industry.” Various representatives from the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Siddharthnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Nepal Chamber of Commerce, and the Confederation of Nepalese Industries have also demanded that the advance tax on food items be rolled back.Subodh Kumar Gupta, former president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said that the government is losing revenue as illegal imports have thrived. “The new tax policy will not only make food items expensive, it will kill the domestic industry as well,\" he said. The private sector has also criticised the government's move to increase customs duty on sponge iron. The import duty on sponge iron has been raised from 1 percent to 2.5 percent. Both scrap and pig iron, which previously had zero import duty, are subjected to a 1 percent import duty. Nepal Iron Rod Producers’ Association also held a press conference in Kathmandu on Wednesday saying that the government’s new tax policy has put the Rs36 billion industry in jeopardy. The association expressed concerns that the government's decision will negatively impact industrialisation in the country in the long run.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Wednesday told Parliament that the domestic market would be protected by the advance income tax on imports of food commodities.He told lawmakers that the 10 percent advance income tax was levied for import substitution.\"This naturally will make imported goods more expensive. Our agricultural markets will be protected,\" he said, adding that he had taken a “correct” move. Pun said that VAT has been removed from potatoes, onions and fruits. \nThe National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power. As the results poured in, Modi addressed the public in a televised speech in which he termed the NDA’s victory a “historic feat”. Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority. Even more distressing for Modi was that the opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 230 seats, a feat even the opposition parties themselves had not expected considering the BJP’s hubris in the run-up to the elections. This was certainly a humbling moment for Modi. An important message the Indian electorate has given Modi, the BJP and the NDA is that there is only so much you can gain from the politics of religion. Coming on the heels of a massive campaign to “reinstate” Lord Ram in Ayodhya, the election was seen as a referendum on Modi’s Hindutva politics. The results have shown that the Indian citizens are not as excited as Modi and his partyfolk about the idea of establishing a “Ram Rajya”. Anti-incumbency aside, the falling numbers—the BJP got 303 seats, and the NDA 353 seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections—are a tell-tale sign of the voters’ dissatisfaction with where India is headed as the living conditions of most people remained largely unchanged amid growing economic disparities. Another humbling prospect for Modi is having to share the stage with N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar of Bihar. The fact that the opposition alliance is now strong enough to lure Naidu and Nitish into their camp—especially with Nitish earning the nickname “Paltu Babu” owing to his history of changing alliances—must have come as a hard truth for Modi, who has wielded a strong hand over governance during his two terms. This could mean that India is headed back to the days of coalition raj, much like in the nineties when small political parties that had emerged from the fringes came to the mainstream and played kingmakers, thus destabilising governments much like in present-day Nepal. How a humbled Modi will negotiate the terms of coalition politics will be for us to see in the coming days. But what the Indian electorate has proven, through the world’s largest electoral machinery, is that democracy is a daily plebiscite. No matter how fool-proof an image you build of yourself as an invincible leader on the back of a subservient media, there is a community of silent voters waiting for the right moment to make a course correction. That the Indian electorate has shattered the prospect of establishing a ‘one party state’ in the globe’s largest democracy will also give heart to those fighting for democratic rights everywhere in the world.  \nThe Indian election results have been announced, and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) emerged as the winner despite the resurgence of the opposition conglomerate INDIA. It is expected that India’s foreign policy towards its neighbours will continue with its ‘neighbourhood first’ and ‘first responder’ policies. In the past 10 years of the Modi government, the focus has largely remained on infrastructure and connectivity with the neighbourhood to strengthen the region’s economic integration. Moreover, India’s foreign policy continues from the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, as there is a basic underlying consensus among the political parties on the contours of India’s neighbourhood policy. The primacy of this policy has been based on stability in the neighbourhood, which has a salutary effect on India’s stability and economic development in the border areas. This cannot be separated from economic development in neighbouring countries and the establishment of broader partnerships in a geo-economic sense.Manifestos and foreign policy Manifestos provide a glimpse into political parties’ thinking on foreign policy. However, policy decisions are made considering larger geopolitical developments, India’s security imperatives and geo-economic impulses in the context of other significant global players and their regional interests. In the recent election, the manifestos of all major political parties focused on domestic issues. Unlike in the past, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto focused on ‘Bharat first’ foreign policy. Leading the global south has always been a priority of India’s foreign policy, evident in the Non-alignment policy, South-South cooperation, Group of 77 and Afro-Asian conference, where India played a leading role. Interestingly, the Modi government prioritised the global south when it took the G20 Presidency in 2023. Notably, the government’s policy on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is mentioned in the section on surakshit bharat.Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are other areas that India has focused on in the past as its outreach has expanded through maritime collaboration and strengthening vision through the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy. As India’s emphasis on infrastructure grows, the India-Middle East-Economic Corridor—the Modi government’s initiative—will get a boost along with the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). Additionally, the development of Chabahar Port will provide an edge to India’s economic outreach. Developing strategic partnerships for mineral security would be a new initiative of the incoming NDA government. Digital public infrastructure has always been the Modi government’s priority. Perhaps considering the voters from the southern states of India, the BJP spoke of establishing Thiruvalluvar cultural centres worldwide in its manifesto. It is, however, unclear where this centre would be in addition to the Indian Cultural centres that India has established across the world. Energy security, green energy and border infrastructure would remain important, and this is where an attempt would be made to connect with neighbours. The master plan for Purvodaya integrated infrastructure development for the Eastern states of India would boost infrastructure development in the Eastern part of South Asia, as BBIN and BIMSTEC nations are contiguous to this region. Both the BJP and Indian National Congress (INC) are committed to opposing terrorism in all its forms and taking steps to counter state-sponsored terrorism. There has been a larger political consensus on this issue in the past. Dialogue with Pakistan will not be possible in the near future unless Islamabad commits to taking steps to ensure that its territory is not used for terrorism against India. One has seen the military government of Musharraf pledge in the past. Moreover, India’s stand on removing Article 370 is non-negotiable, and there is a broad political consensus.The Indian National Congress has emphasised free trade and a rule-based international order. It is important to note that the INC and its INDIA partner would ‘uphold continuity in India’s foreign policy’ as promised in its manifesto. Therefore, there will not be any divergence in India’s foreign policy in general and in its neighbourhood in particular. The INC’s manifesto also emphasises the global south and multilateral institutions. Neighbourhood policyThe BJP will continue its policies towards India’s neighbours, prioritising robust economic partnership through trade, infrastructure and energy connectivity, which will spur growth. Its manifesto touched on the government's broader foreign policy agenda, with an emphasis on ‘neighbourhood first’. The INC, however, has made special efforts to outline its approach towards India’s neighbourhood. It is important to note that the foreign policy approach of the opposition is crucial because they are members of the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs, where issues of foreign policy are discussed threadbare in which the opposition participates. The INC has devoted a section to India’s neighbourhood, for example, prioritising India’s special relationship with Nepal and Bhutan to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s relationship with Nepal has been unstable over the territorial dispute, and both are currently discussing ways to resolve the issue. Both INC and BJP emphasise negotiation to resolve problems between India and Nepal. They are enhancing the economic and cultural relationship with Bangladesh, which is already on track, especially the economic relationship with Bangladesh where bilateral trade is touching almost $18 billion. It needs to be underlined that during Manmohan Singh’s government, India had extended zero tariffs on 61 products—out of which 48 products were related to Bangladesh’s garment industries, which is a major contributor to the nation’s GDP. The INC also speaks of enhancing the political and economic relationship with Sri Lanka. On both economic and political counts, ECTA is still under negotiation, even though the Tamil ethnic issue remains a problem. India has emphasised addressing the grievances of Tamils in Sri Lanka, which also has implications for India as it continues to host Tamil refugees who fled Sri Lanka due to the ethnic conflict there. Sri Lanka is poised for the presidential election, followed by the parliamentary election this year. These issues would remain hotly debated in Sri Lanka’s domestic politics. In this context, regional parties in Tamil Nadu would be essential in shaping India’s policy towards Sri Lanka. The INC has promised to repair the relationship with the Maldives. However, the Modi government has taken steps to engage with the Muizzu government in the Maldives to ensure that the relationship does not suffer from the nationalist electoral rhetoric that was a part of Muizzu’s election campaign. Though INC is candid about human rights violations in Myanmar, it is unlikely that India would adopt any stringent measures against Myanmar’s military regime especially when India’s vital security interests are at stake. It is equally concerned about the cross-border implications of the conflict in Myanmar on its population in the ethnically volatile North East region.Wither foreign policyBoth the incumbent BJP’s manifesto and that of the INC, which would be in opposition, suggest that there will be no drastic changes in foreign policy. The manifestos are not divergent, and the sum and substance remain the same. Both parties have similar views on resuming dialogue with Pakistan. There is an emphasis on infrastructure development that has now become an integral part of trade and economic integration. A stable neighbourhood is entwined with India’s security, given the porosity of the border and ethnocultural cross-border linkages. The political parties in India know that a stakeholder’s approach to each other’s prosperity and security would shape a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s global outreach and place in the emerging global order would shape its foreign policy. \nIn the 2024 Indian elections, the ruling BJP lost its grip on Faizabad due to public backlash against its hate-filled politics, signifying a setback for Modi's divisive rhetoric and the rise of opposition.\nNepalese dairy farmers face ongoing financial hardship due to unpaid dues from private companies despite previous agreements, highlighting the government's neglect of the agricultural sector, leading to reduced income for farmers and higher prices for consumers.\nIsrael targeted a Gaza school on Thursday that it said contained a Hamas compound, killing fighters involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the eight-month war, but Gaza media said the strike killed at least 27 people seeking shelter.Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.“The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,” Thawabta told Reuters.Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks.In an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.The remarks by Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group’s reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.“The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,” Haniyeh said.Asked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group’s reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a “thumbs up” emoji.Since a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.Washington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.Biden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.Last week’s announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Hamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the war’s only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.Israel’s military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.Meanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.ISRAEL LUKEWARMAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".Far-right members of Netanyahu’s government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel’s longest-serving leader.Centrist opponents who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel’s offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.“Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.Two children were among the dead laid out on Wednesday in the city’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Mourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.“This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express” said their father Abu Mohammed Abu Saif. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.Putin, in his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the war in Ukraine began, said the West was wrong to assume Russia would never use nuclear weapons, and said the Kremlin’s nuclear doctrine should not be taken lightly.When asked about NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg’s calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin differentiated between different missiles but warned allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with ever more powerful weapons was a serious escalation that was drawing the West towards a war with Russia.Russia’s response, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said, would be to shoot down the Western missiles, and specifically mentioned US ATACMS, and British and French missile systems.c“If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems,” Putin said.Putin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.President Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range US-supplied weapons.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.NUCLEAR RISKSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming US election.“No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.”Putin said Russia did not care who the next US president was but said the US court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.“They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,” said Putin.More than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.When asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia’s nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.“For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,” Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.“We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone’s actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.”Russia’s published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia “when the very existence of the state is put under threat.”NATO ATTACK?Putin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.Putin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.The West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.Ukraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.Western leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia’s warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world’s most powerful military alliance.Both Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.“You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You’re only hurting yourself with this, you know?” Putin said.“They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.” \nA passenger train crashed into a freight train in Pardubice, Czech Republic late Wednesday, killing four and injuring over 20.\nPartly to generally cloudy skies with light rain and snowfall in parts of Nepal, with temperatures ranging from 11.5°C to 40.2°C.\nHima Bista, director of Women LEAD Nepal, uses her passion for reading to enhance leadership sessions by citing credible sources and promoting a reading culture among young women.\nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, who was in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli have congratulated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his party’s victory in the 2024 elections.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats, 21 more than the 272 needed to form a government.“Congratulations to PM @narendramodi on the electoral success of BJP and NDA in the Loksabha elections for the third consecutive term,” reads the prime minister’s post.Congress President Deuba, who is also the leader of the main opposition, also took to social media X to congratulate the Indian prime minister.“Congratulations to @narendramodi ji, a great friend of Nepal, on securing a third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India following the BJP and NDA's victory,” former prime minister Deuba wrote on Wednesday. “Your leadership, dedication, and vision continue to inspire and shape a bright future for India.”Likewise, CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli joined the leaders to congratulate the Indian leader.“I congratulate the Indian people for their great democratic exercise,” former prime minister Oli said on X. “I wish for your continued success in driving India’s progress and prosperity.” \nIsraeli shelling and airstrikes killed at least 19 people in central and south Gaza on Tuesday including two policemen who were helping protect humanitarian aid deliveries in the southern city of Rafah, Palestinian medics said.Seventeen of the deaths, they said, occurred in separate Israeli airstrikes on the al-Bureij and al-Maghazi refugee camps and the city of Deir-al-Balah in central Gaza, and by late Tuesday tanks were shelling an area just east of the al-Nusseirat camp, residents said.Some told Reuters via chat app that the renewed Israeli military push was sowing panic, with some families living in al-Maghazi starting to flee under tank fire, with four shells crashing near a clinic in the camp.In a brief statement issued earlier in the day, the Israeli military said jets were hitting Hamas militant targets in central Gaza while ground forces were operating “in a focused manner with guidance from intelligence” in the al-Bureij area.It gave no update on activity in Rafah, into which Israeli forces swept last month in what the military calls a limited operation to root out Hamas’ last intact combat units after almost eight months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip.The small city fringing Gaza’s southern border with Egypt had been sheltering about one million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults in other parts of the enclave, but most have fled again in the face of Israel's tank-led advance.Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy Hamas after militants stormed across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.Qatar said on Tuesday it had delivered an Israeli ceasefire proposal to Hamas that reflected a three-phase proposal presented on Friday by US President Joe Biden, and that the paper was now much closer to the positions of both sides.Qatar, which has been mediating on Gaza between Israel and Hamas, also stressed that there should be a clear position from both parties to clinch a deal, its foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press briefing.“The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the (humanitarian) crisis”, Majed al-Ansari said.However, a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, reiterated on Tuesday it could not agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent truce and complete withdrawal from Gaza.For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu repeated that there can be no permanent peace unless Hamas is eradicated, as he struggles with profound political divisions at home over the US-backed truce proposal.An aide to Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel had accepted the framework advanced by Biden, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.On Tuesday, his biggest coalition partner said it would support such a deal even if it entails an overhaul of the war strategy. But Netanyahu’s far-right allies in the government threatened to bolt and bring it down if he wound down the Gaza war without having annihilated Hamas.Biden’s framework proposal involves in its first stage a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from “all populated areas” of Gaza and some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last “as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments.”In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin. The last stage of the plan would include the reconstruction of the shattered coastal enclave.Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, will travel to the region this week to push for a hostage deal and ceasefire, a US official told Reuters on Tuesday. \nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nThe Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal has continuously led the Madhesh government since the provincial governments were first set up following the 2017 elections.Over the past seven years, Yadav has always been on the governing side despite the many mergers and splits among Madhesh-based parties.The party’s Lalbabu Raut is the only chief minister (among the seven) who completed a full five-year term after 2017. After the general elections in November 2022, Saroj Kumar Yadav of the same party has been leading the Madhesh government. Though the Madhesh administration introduced a few good programmes, experts say, it failed to lead the government on many fronts. “As leaders and people from Madhesh were at the forefront of advocating for the federal system, they should have done more to strengthen the system,” Sohan Shah, a Madhesh expert, told the Post. “The party not only failed to strengthen federalism but also in good governance and other parameters.”He accused the Madheshi leaders of wasting more time bargaining with the centre instead of working to strengthen the federal system.Shah adds a fresh anecdote to explain why the JSP-Nepal-led government can be termed a failure in Madhesh.The federal government allocates the budget for provinces and the local level every year under the equalisation and special grants headers. As per the rule, the provincial Cabinet, in the case of the province, and local units, submit proposals to the National Planning Commission (NPC) with a demand for grants for projects. While all local units of Madhesh submitted their proposals, the provincial government failed to do so, Shah claimed.Except for the Madhesh Province, the NPC received over 3,600 proposals from across the country for fiscal equalisation and special grants for the upcoming fiscal year, to be incorporated in the national budget.“That was sheer negligence on the part of the Madhesh government,” an NPC official told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We did not have such an experience where a provincial government did not apply for a significant amount of the national budget.”After leading Madhesh politics for more than a decade and a half, Upendra Yadav lost the 2022 general election to CK Raut in Saptari-2. It was a severe blow to the veteran leader to lose the race to a newbie. With the slogan of good and efficient governance and an anti-corruption campaign, Raut’s party won popular support in Madhesh. The new party secured 13 seats in the provincial assembly, becoming the fourth-largest party in Madhesh. Despite this the province's government was again led by JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party with 19 seats in the assembly. However, the JSP-Nepal’s strength further diminished after the Ashok Rai faction split the party on May 5 and launched the Janata Samata Party. Upendra Yadav has challenged the split, and the case is sub judice.Of the party’s total 12 members in the federal parliament, seven have joined the Rai-led party. The assembly members in Madhesh, however, didn’t join the new party as the party formation process was immediately challenged in the court.A newcomer in provincial and national politics, Janamat has been joining and quitting governments.“Janamat Party was prepared to remain in the opposition because the party wanted nothing less than government leadership. While the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to form a new government in Madhesh, they cannot do it without Janamat’s support, and are left with no option but to accept Janamat's candidate for new chief minister,” said Shah.The CPN-UML is the largest party in the provincial assembly, with 25 seats, and the Congress, with 22 seats, is the second-largest. However, Upendra Yadav’s party has always led the provincial government.Experts say that major issues of Madhesh cannot be addressed in a true sense until the big political parties ignore them.Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh expert, also claims that the province got nothing substantive in the seven years of federal exercise. If the political parties other than JSP-Nepal lead the province, it could be in favour of the Madheshi people in many ways, Kishor said. “Madhesh does not belong to just one Madheshi party; it belongs to the other parties as well,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “Parties other than JSP-Nepal vying to lead the Madhesh government means they also should own the agenda of Madhesh, which is a good thing.” Chandra Kishore added that if the new political parties lead the Madhesh Province, it could bring plurality in governance. As per the agreement reached between the three parties–CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), and Janamat Party—Raut’s Janamat is most likely to lead the next government in the province. “Raut’s party could challenge Yadav’s dominance in the province with an effective governance to establish him as a key political figure of Madhesh,” said Chandra Kishore. Incumbent chief minister, Saroj Kumar Yadav, lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support for the government. This has set the stage for a floor test on Wednesday.To claim the position in the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister needs the support of 54 members. Though the ruling partners claim that the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), in addition to Nagarik Unmukti and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, will also support the government, the Unified Socialist and the LSP remain non-committal so far.On May 30, the UML, the Maoist Centre, and the Janamat Party agreed to support Mahesh Prasad Yadav, the Janamat parliamentary party leader, as the chief minister of the Province in a meeting held in Janakpur. On May 29, Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba invited Upendra Yadav, chair of Janata Samajbadi Nepal, Mahantha Thakur, chair of LSP, and Madhav Nepal, chair of the CPN (Unified Socialist), to his residence to discuss the political equation in Madhesh. During the meeting, three opposition parties including the Unified Socialist, a federal ruling partner, had agreed to uphold the JSP-Nepal’s leadership in Madhesh Province. However, Ratneshwar Goit of the Unified Socialist talking to the Post said, “Our party is discussing whom we should support to form the provincial government.”  \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is gearing up for a Cabinet reshuffle, but the big question is whether he will replace the entire set of ministers from each coalition partner or just add a few new faces.To reorganise his Cabinet, the prime minister has already started consulting his alliance partners, specifically the CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli, the CPN (Unified Socialist) Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others.According to Maoist Centre leaders, as soon as the process of forming a new government in Madhes province concludes, the prime minister will start the process of Cabinet reshuffle. Over the last couple of days, Dahal, Oli and Nepal have held several rounds of talks in order to give full shape to the provincial government in Sudurpaschim, to form a new government in Madhesh, and bring new parties like the Nagarik Unmukti and Janamat Party into the federal government.Once a new government is formed in Madhesh, the prime minister is likely to add some ministers from the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Janamat Party, said Mahesh Bartaula, chief whip of the UML. This has been the topic of discussion among the top leaders in the past few days, he said. “I don’t think the entire Cabinet will change,” he said.However, according to one Maoist Centre leader, the prime minister is in a difficult situation after the chairman of the CPN (Unified Socialist) Nepal sought a package deal on power-sharing.Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist said his party has communicated its demands clearly to both Dahal and Oli.“During recent meetings with the prime minister and the UML chief, our chairman made it clear that we need an additional minister in the federal government, a fair share in Koshi, Madhesh and Karnali governments, and participation of the UML and Maoist Centre in the Sudurpaschim government before the formation of the government in Koshi,” he said.Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of the Unified Socialist is the chief minister in Sudurpaschim, but the delay by the UML and Maoist Centre in joining the government has caused frustration within the Unified Socialist.In order to extend support for forming a new government in the Madhesh province, which will probably be led by the Janamat Party, the Unified Socialist party has withdrawn its two ministers from the current Saroj Kumar Yadav government. Yadav is the chief minister of the Madhesh province and represents the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.A section of the Maoist Centre has been calling for the replacement of the entire set of ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. But the UML, the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Unified Socialist are against doing so. “Some of our ministers have been serving since December 2022, so some leaders in the party want to replace them with new faces,” a central committee member of the Maoist Centre said. With the exception of Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, there is a call within the party to replace all the ministers, the leader said, adding that “this agenda will likely be discussed during the upcoming meeting of the party.” Besides the prime minister, the CPN (Maoist Centre) has one deputy prime minister, and four ministers in the Cabinet.“There are several issues, but nothing has been discussed,” said Govinda Acharya, press adviser to the Prime Minister Dahal. “First, ministers from the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party are likely to join the Cabinet as per the understanding among party leaders.”“Our position is clear,” said Khatiwada, the Unified Socialist spokesperson. “We want a package deal, which we have clearly communicated both to prime minister Dahal and UML chair Oli.”“From the centre to the provincial level as well as in other major political appointments, we need a fair share,” said Khatiwada. He complained that the prime minister and the UML chief assured several times in the past to address the grievances of the Unified Socialist, but the promise has not been kept. To show his frustration, party chief Nepal participated in a meeting of the opposition parties a few days ago.“We have decided to help the federal coalition install a new government in the Madhesh province. So we need a fair share in provincial governments in Madhesh, Koshi, Karnali and Sudurpaschim. Cabinet reshuffle is solely the prime minister’s prerogative and he might be feeling pressure from within his own party. He may replace his party’s ministers, but this has not been discussed in the meetings of alliance members,” Khatiwada told the Post. \nKP Sharma Oli, the chairman of the major ruling partner CPN-UML, has accused Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun of failing to orient the government’s annual budget towards socialism as per the spirit of the constitution.Addressing a UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli pointed out the shortcomings in the budget preparation process and criticised the finance minister for not consulting the UML during its preparation.The remarks by the chief of the largest party in the ruling coalition come as Parliament prepares to start deliberations on the budget, which Pun presented on May 28.“What is the theoretical orientation of the budget, and where do we intend to go?” Oli asked the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal at the party meeting. “All these things should be discussed during deliberations in Parliament,” Oli said, instructing the party’s lawmakers as the parliamentary party leader. The government did not increase allocation for social security schemes in the budget presented last week, and it did not introduce any new programmes for social security. “If Oli read the inability to spend more on social security as the government’s failure to orient the budget along the constitutional goal of socialism, he is mistaken,” said a finance ministry official on condition of anonymity. “We are facing resource constraints to set aside more funds for such distributive programmes.”“Socialism is a buzzword among communist parties. To be pragmatic, however, the funds available are not enough to introduce a socialism-oriented budget,” the officer told the Post.Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country. Nonetheless, the private sector has been given control over all important facets of the public and economic spheres.The Nepali Congress champions liberalisation and privatisation, but the party's guiding principle is democratic socialism. Other political parties, including the UML and other communist forces, follow a similar path. Though the constitution mentions Nepal as a socialism-oriented democracy, the charter does not define socialism. Even Parliament has not considered the matter a topic of discussion. “There is a lot of confusion over what socialism actually means in our context,” Surendra Pandey, a former finance minister and vice-chair of the UML, told the Post.Nepal’s political parties should compete in a production-oriented economy rather than a distributive one, Pandey suggested. “If we only focus on distribution-oriented fiscal policies, our economy will eventually stagnate.”A look at world history shows that revolution and evolution are the two bases to achieve socialism, Pandey said. “After their revolutions, countries like France and China nationalised the properties of the erstwhile rulers and distributed them to the public apart from enacting other reforms in order to achieve socialism.”In Nepal, “we need to abide by evolution-based reforms to attain socialism,” Pandey said. Many European countries follow this model. Incomes and properties of the rich are taxed to raise funds for social-security programmes, he added. “However, if we are looking for a distribution-oriented scheme for political gains, then it won’t yield significant results in the long run.”Economists also believe that a socialism-oriented budget is unrealistic during a time of economic hardship. They say the budgets presented even by the erstwhile Oli-led governments were far from socialism-oriented.Oli became prime minister two times: once after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 and again after the first election held under the same constitution in 2017. The governments he led presented at least three budgets. “Apart from running some fair-price shops or selling some goats and sheep on the occasion of Dashain-Tihar, no government in Nepal has taken any concrete steps to build a socialist-oriented community as mentioned in the constitution,” Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri, a former governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, told the Post. “This was also true of the previous Oli-led governments.” Chhetri said that the budget for the next fiscal year is conservative. “The communist-led government is always criticised for its distribution-oriented budget, which comes to galvanise its populist agenda,” added Chhetri. “But it’s an illusion to believe that a distribution-oriented budget with a focus on social security schemes is the way towards socialism.”Oli on Saturday instructed his party’s lawmakers to freely criticise the government if they find any instances of budget allocation in breach of the principle. “As a ruling party, we support this budget and will help with its implementation,” Oli said. “However, this does not mean that we should not point out deficiencies in the budget.”Addressing the parliamentary party meeting, Oli expressed his displeasure at lack of consultations among the ruling partners. He also raised the question of whether the budget was prepared by the finance minister himself or by the Maoist party he represents.“The budget could have been much better if the finance minister had engaged in more extensive consultation with the coalition partners,” Oli said.President Ramchandra Paudel presented the government’s policies and programmes in Parliament on May 14. In principle, the finance minister prepares the annual budget based on the policies and programmes and the feedback given by lawmakers during the deliberations on the policies and programmes.However, the policies and programmes could not be discussed in Parliament this time owing to its prolonged obstruction by the main opposition Congress demanding a parliamentary probe in the cooperatives fraud. \nIt took several House obstructions and rounds of negotiations and meetings to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives.Not only were the parliamentary proceedings paralysed, but the entire national politics was focussed on the dispute over the formation of the probe committee until it was constituted on Tuesday. But now that the committee is in place, when it will start the investigation is still unsure. And no parties, including those on whose demand the panel was formed, have shown any urgency to start the probe.Following an agreement among the major parties, the House of Representatives on Tuesday formed a seven-member committee headed by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa.Its other members are Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Nepali Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.The committee members say they are not sure when the investigation will begin. Neupane said the committee has not even held its first meeting.It is the chairperson’s responsibility to call the meeting, Neupane said. “We may have to remind him to call the meeting if he continues to delay it.”Thapa said he has requested the Speaker and the Parliament Secretariat to arrange the office and personnel for the committee. “I am currently in my constituency in Pyuthan. We will get down to business once we get our office and staff,\" he told the Post.Other members of the committee, however, say that though the office setup is necessary to start the investigation, holding a meeting and carrying out preparatory work was possible without it. The panel must prepare its working procedure within the framework finalised by the committee led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs.The Giri-led panel had agreed on four terms of reference (ToR) for the probe committee.As per the ToR, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk.Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problematic cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and other companies and organisations. It will also probe the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in the illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations to recover the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative are the ones that injected money into the Gorkha Media Network. It took weeks for the parties to agree on the ToR as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after all the cooperatives linked with the Gorkha Media Network were subjected to probe.“Our committee has big tasks to accomplish, but the chairperson is not showing any urgency,” said a committee member. The Thapa-led panel has three months to complete its job. \nA standoff between Road Division, Kathmandu, and Kathmandu Metropolitan City at New Road ended without any untoward incident on Monday after the federal government deployed a massive police force.The city police, deployed in huge numbers to stop the division’s workers from repairing the road section between New Road gate and Juddha Salik destroyed by the metropolis, were backed off after federal police intervened.“We are committed to executing an order of the metropolis to expand pedestrian lanes in the New Road area,” said Raju Nath Pandey, chief of City Police. “We backed off, as we cannot scuffle with the federal police force. Everybody knows who deployed the federal police and what their intention is. There are hundreds of places in Kathmandu where road conditions are not good, but the Road Division has hurried to fix the parts we cut for expansion of the sidewalks.”The dispute between the two agencies—Road Division and Kathmandu metropolis—over expanding pedestrian lanes and not letting cutting road sections spiraled into Monday’s standoff.Some ten days ago, the metropolis cut 1.5 metres on both sides of roads in New Road to expand footpaths.The division intervened and stopped the metropolis workers from cutting the roads, saying that the road section comes under its jurisdiction and that the city office has not taken approval for the footpath expansion.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed officials to dump truckloads of dirt and trash in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office, blaming the agencies for delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj which had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.“If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work,” Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media.Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.The Road Division, which picked up the dust and garbage dumped by the metropolis on its own, criticised the metropolis for its act.“The behaviour of the largest and responsible local government of the country mocks the rule of law, and this kind of behaviour in a violent and chaotic manner will never enhance the dignity of the metropolis,” reads the statement issued by the division.The division later issued an ultimatum to the KMC, asking it to fix the damaged parts of the roads within two days.When the metropolis ignored the ultimatum, the division itself repaired the damaged parts taking the help of federal police forces.“The metropolis dug up the roads without taking approval from our office. Instead of seeking approval, it gave us notice about its decision,” said Pramod Khatiwada, information officer at the division. “As the monsoon is about to start and the New Road area is one of the busiest road sections, it was our responsibility to repair it.”When asked if metropolis officials are committed to expanding the pavements, Khatiwada said that he hoped concerned officials would “come to their senses” and sort out the disputes, obtaining approval from concerned agencies.“They should first hold discussions with officials and higher agencies and convince them why they need to expand the footpath and take over the road section from us,” said Khatiwada. “We hope that the city office will not repeat the same mistake again and again.”Metropolis officials said that footpaths in new road areas, which always remain busy and packed, should be widened enough so that pedestrians can move freely. Officials claimed that locals from the New Road area have also requested the city office for the expansion.“Locals have also complained about insecurity and sexual harassment in walking on the footpath,” said Sunita Maharjan, elected ward member of Ward 24 of the metropolis. “Locals from our ward have no objection to the expansion of the footpath. The metropolis has started expansion works in demand of the public.”Sobha Malakar, a local from the Indrachowk area, said that it is very difficult to walk on the narrow pavement in the New Road area. Most of the locals of Ward 24 demanded the expansion of the footpaths with the city office. “It is very difficult to walk freely on the footpath in the New Road area,” said Malakar. “Walking on the footpath is very suffocating in the area. Women and girls walk on the road risking collision with vehicles.”Some people supported the Road Division's moves to prevent the city office from expanding the footpath on Monday. Locals of Ward 24 said that those not seeking pavement expansion are from other wards who fear that the already narrowed roads in their area would be further narrowed.“Those who had protested for parking in New Road have been protesting against the expansion of the footpath,” reads Mayor Shah’s status posted on social media.He asked the public to consider how the road will be narrowed for driving when a sidewalk is made only of parts that were used for parking in the past. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority on Monday filed a graft case at the Special Court against 14 individuals, including Gajendra Maharjan, the mayor of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur.The case has been filed against them, charging them with causing a revenue loss of Rs1.04 billion to the state coffers while approving tenders for the extraction of sand and stones from the fiscal year 2018-19 to 2022-23.The CIAA has named Maharjan, the then administrative officer, along with other people’s representatives and contractors, as defendants in the case. Information Officer at the Special Court, Yagya Raj Regmi, said the CIAA had filed the case on the charge of causing revenue loss by awarding contracts at rates lower than those fixed by the government.Maharjan, who was elected mayor from the Nepali Congress, is serving his second term as the municipal chief. \nMany countries worldwide have started using smart systems, including artificial intelligence, to manage chaotic traffic. Nepal, however, has chosen to deploy traffic rule violators as traffic rule keepers.What concerns legal experts, former law enforcement officials, and the chair of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of House of Representatives is the individual whim and fantasy of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Ravi Lamichhane, who issued a direction under agencies concerned under his ministry to enforce the decision to deploy rule violators on the road for traffic management.“Stop ruling people at an individual whim. This is neither Rana nor Shah regime or military rule,” said Ramhari Khatiwada, chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House. “Home minister should stop humiliating people, and he too is not above the law.”Khatiwada said that he had sought time with Home Minister Lamichhane to discuss the issue on Friday but he did not give him time. He said that the government should formulate a law first and bring regulations if it thinks deploying rule violators for traffic management is necessary.The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division of Kathmandu said that it had deployed 1,302 people who were booked for traffic rules violations, including drunk driving, on Wednesday.“We are only implementing the instructions of the higher agency,” said Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, the division’s spokesperson. “We provided basic instructions to the rule violators and deployed them on streets for traffic management.”When asked if rules violators would help traffic police manage Kathmandu’s traffic, Shrestha said that even the traffic police, who received one to one-and-a-half years of training, sometimes could not handle the traffic chaos.Former senior officials at Nepal Police also questioned the intention of the home minister to force traffic rule violators to stay on the roads. They say that existing law doesn't support the home minister’s decision, and it also jeopardises the safety of those being deployed on the streets.“The decision to deploy rule violators is against the will of the people, which is against the provision that the state will not force anyone to serve against their will,” said Hemanta Malla, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police. “This decision can be challenged in court.”Managing traffic is an expert’s job. Traffic police, who have worked for years in Valley's traffic management, also sometimes find the job challenging. Legal experts said that the home minister should bring law and regulation first if he thinks the valley's traffic would be better managed by forcing rule violators to stay on the roads.“The decision is against the principle of the rule of law. People cannot be forced to follow the home minister’s irrational directions,” said Raju Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer. “Respective committee of the House, National Human Rights Commission and other concerned agencies should take note of this decision and direct the concerned agencies to stop ruling people at individual whims.” \n\nPrime Minister Dahal triggered the breakthrough of the headrace tunnel of the 900 MW Arun III Hydroelectric Project in Nepal, marking a crucial step in the India-funded project aimed at boosting Nepal's energy capacity and facilitating electricity exports.\nVidushi Rana appointed Honorary Consul of Iceland in Nepal, inaugurating the new Consulate and fostering bilateral relations between the nations.\nDairy farmers face unpaid dues with protests planned due to dairy companies breaching an agreement with government to settle farmers' outstanding dues, despite rising liabilities caused by low dairy demand and state-owned dairies seeking a bailout fund.\nPolio vaccination campaigns in Nepal's Tarai region are disrupted by extreme heat, causing delays in immunizing over 1.46 million children against Type-2 polio while the country remains polio-free since 2010.\nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nNepal confirms the spread of Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4, offshoots of the Omicron variant responsible for the recent surge.\nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York.

A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal made a disastrous start to their 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World campaign on their return to the cricket’s biggest stage after a decade as they lost their opening match of the Group D to the Netherlands by six wickets in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday.Nepal, who were invited to bat first after losing the toss, posted a paltry 106 all out from 19.2 overs at the Grand Prairie Stadium after the batters struggled against a disciplined Dutch bowling.The Rhinos repeated the same mistakes with the bat as openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh failed to give their team a good start again after the play was slightly delayed due to wet outfield.Netherlands spinner Tim Pringle (3-20) and pacer Logan van Beek (3-18) were the biggest thorns in Nepal’s flesh as their three-wicket hauls put Nepal inside the pressure cooker in an overcast condition throughout the innings.In between, Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede also bowled excellently in the bowling-friendly surface, finishing 2-19 and 2-22, respectively.Nepal found themselves in big trouble early on at 15-2 in 3.1 overs when they lost Shiekh to Pringle for four in the second over and Bhurtel to van Beek for seven.Anil Sah departed next for 11 after Pringle had him caught by van Beek, leaving Nepal at 40-3.Skipper Rohit Paudel was the only batter who looked comfortable against the Dutch bowling attack that struck regularly. Paudel played a brisk 35 runs off 37 balls to revive Nepal innings, but he never found support in the middle order as Kushal Malla (9), Dipendra Singh Airee (1) and Sompal Kami (0) all fell in quick succession.Paudel’s resistance also ended in the 16th over when Pringle had him caught by Max O’Dowd for his third wicket.Karan KC scored 12-ball 17 and Gulsan Jha played 15-ball 14 to take Nepal to 106 from 84-7, but the final three wickets tumbled swiftly and without adding a run after van Beek struck twice in successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel conceded they could have stretched their total a little further.“The conditions while batting were really challenging,” the Nepal skipper said. “Netherlands bowled really well. We could have stretched it a little more and had more partnerships through the middle.”The Netherlands captain Scott Edwards credited the bowlers for their match-winning show.\"Our bowlers were awesome,” he said. “We got two or three wickets in the powerplay. All five of our bowlers were brilliant.”In response, Nepal bowled tightly, but could not stop O’Dowd to take the Dutch past the 107-run target with eight balls to spare. The Netherlands lost their opener Michael Levitt for a cheap one after Sompal Kami had him caught by Airee in 1.2 overs.But O’Dowd scored an unbeaten half-century to guide his side to 109-4 in 18.4 overs.O’Dowd smashed a patient knock of 48-ball 54 that featured four boundaries and one six.Despite a tenacious bowling attack, Nepal gave the Dutch the edge in the game after Sheikh, Kami and Paudel all dropped catches, which otherwise would have put their opponents under extra pressure.\"We did very well as a bowling unit,” Paudel said after the loss. “The last catch that I dropped was not well…and we didn't catch well.”Levitt and Singh, who played 22 runs off 28 balls, added 40 runs for the second wicket to steady the ship, before Sybrand Engelbrecht played 16-ball 14 to take the Dutch closer to the target.O’Dowd then smacked Abinash Bohara with two fours and six off the 19th over to wrap things up for the Dutch.“Ideally, we would have got the runs a little quicker, but it was great the way Max batted, and Bassie finished it off well,” Edwards said.Nepal next play against Sri Lanka on June 11. \nNepal will aim to impress at the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies when they launch their campaign against the Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.Drawn in Group D, the Rhinos will play their next group matches against Sri Lanka in Florida on June 12, followed by clashes against South Africa on June 15 and against Bangladesh on June 17 in the Caribbean. Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament. \nNepal’s leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane’s hopes to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies all but ended after the US Embassy in Kathmandu rejected him a visa for a second time in ten days.The embassy had called Lamichhane for an interview for a second time on Thursday afternoon following a diplomatic note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had requested the government and other stakeholders to take initiatives after Lamichhane was initially denied a visa last week.CAN confirmed Lamichhane’s visa denial in a press release on Thursday.“Despite taking necessary initiatives, along with the diplomatic note, from the government of Nepal, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Youth and Sports, National Sports Council, CAN and International Cricket Council (ICC) for cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane’s visit to participate in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the US Embassy has expressed its inability to give travel permission (visa) to national player Lamichhane to play the World Cup,” CAN stated. After initially denying visa to Lamichhane, the embassy had said it could not comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“The US Embassy in Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup,” the embassy said last week.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”Lamichhane’s supporters had taken to streets on Wednesday to express their disappointment over visa denial to the cricketer.The country’s cricket governing body had submitted a list of only 14 players to the ICC on the May 25 deadline, leaving one slot for Lamichhane in hope that the cricketer would get a visa.The former national cricket team captain was not included in the provisional squad because the Kathmandu District Court had convicted him of raping a girl in a hotel in Kathmandu in August 2022 and had sentenced him to eight years in jail in January this year.CAN had lifted suspension on Lamichhane clearing his path to participate in the national and international cricket after Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal earlier this month.The cricket body had immediately started preparation to send Lamichhane to the US after lifting his ban.CAN had also talked to the ICC and secured approval from the world cricket governing body to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad if he received a visa.Before the rape trial, Lamichhane had enjoyed a glittering career. He is the first and the only Nepali cricketer to play in the Indian Premier League. He was also sought after by T20 leagues around the globe. However, Lamichhane’s success came to a sudden fall when ‘Gaushala 26’—the name police gave to the victim—filed a rape complaint against him.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when the rape complaint was filed.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.Lamichhane was part of the squad that reached the semi finals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier in October last year to book their ticket to the T20 World Cup after a decade. Nepal made their World Cup debut in World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.He was again suspended from cricketing activities after Kathmandu District Court convicted him in the rape charge.Lamichhane’s visa rejections means the current 15-member team, who are already in the United States, will likely play the T20 World Cup.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York—while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal will take on the United States on Thursday in their final warmup match in Dallas ahead of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The Rhinos are scheduled to begin their World Cup campaign by playing against the Netherlands on June 4.On Wednesday, the Nepali squad, including nine players who attended the training session, exerted themselves at the Mustangs Cricket Academy in Dallas. The team was notably relieved by the return of Dipendra Singh Airee, whose presence is expected to significantly bolster the squad’s performance. Airee had sustained an ankle injury in St. Vincent, West Indies. His absence extended to the practice match in Houston, US, where he was unable to participate.“Airee has returned to training today and looked in good form. So he will play against the United States,” said skipper Rohit Paudel after the training.Nepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday. “We are ready for the match against the United States. We have struggled in the batting in power plays,” said Paudel. “I am confident that we will also do well in the World Cup with these two warm up games.”Paudel stressed Nepal’s unique advantage in these warm up matches, particularly since they are taking place on the same ground where Nepal will face the Netherlands on June 4. According to him, this provides the team with a valuable opportunity to familiarise themselves with the conditions and make strategies accordingly.This will mark the United States’ first warm up game ahead of the World Cup. Their previous warm up match against Bangladesh was washed out by rain, with no single ball bowled. The United States will begin their World Cup campaign against Canada in the inaugural match of the tournament on June 1.Photos: Hemanta Shrestha \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nExit polls could not accurately capture discontent among the social and economic castes that are ranked lower in India in key states, resulting in an overestimation of electoral support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, two pollsters said.The findings led to turmoil in Indian stock markets on Tuesday, after rosier projections for Modi in the general election earlier boosted markets.Three of five polls initially projected Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win more than the 303 electoral seats it won in 2019, while the opposition “INDIA” alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party would win 125 to 182 seats.The predictions boosted financial markets ahead of the release of elections results on Tuesday.However, vote counts showed much lower numbers - around 240 for the BJP and 293 for Modi’s alliance that includes regional parties. That caused the worst intraday fall in stocks since March 2020 on concerns over challenges for implementing economic reforms due to Modi’s dependence on allies.Pradeep Gupta, head of Axis My India poll agency, said the survey failed to capture a shift among voters in the less privileged sections of society in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra states, where 170 seats in total were up for grabs, and where BJP lost a whopping 45 seats, compared to 2019.“This is our mistake,” Gupta said.He noted many voters in those sections of society didn’t disclose their voting decisions for fear of being attacked by electoral workers who did not share their political views.“We could not predict as accurately as we are known for,” he said, referring to challenges in capturing how voters had swung in favour of the opposition from other regional parties.Over 900 people were deployed for face-to-face post-ballot interviews with a sample of 582,000 voters, with the response rate varying from 40-50% in urban areas and 70-80% in rural areas, Gupta said.Many women voters asked males in their families to respond on their behalf, resulting in wrong estimations of their voting decisions, he said.“We are wrong in 2024,” said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of CVoter polling agency, whose numbers were overestimated by about 50 seats in favour of Modi’s party amid incorrect projections for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“I wish I could stop giving seat numbers but that’s a professional hazard” as the media keeps asking for those estimates, Deshmukh said. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nAmong the three most populist parliamentarians of these times, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli is the sharpest as well as the seniormost. He was born in the interregnum between the fall of the Ranarchy in 1951 and the rise of the absolutist Shah regime in 1960, when the Gramscian prognosis of “a great variety of morbid symptoms” was apparent throughout the country.Sharma Oli perhaps realised early on that the criteria for fitness for survival in the politics of Nepal differed from those of other newly decolonised countries. Freedom fighters of independence movements had to paint the picture of a brighter future to persuade the masses. Here, King Mahendra had convinced his loyal subjects that they should long for the greatness of the “unifier”, the creations of the “versifier”, and the valour of “mercenaries” instead. Even though he is the unchallenged supremo of a supposedly Marxist-Leninist party, Sharma Oli prefers to talk about culture, religion and language rather than the plight of the poor and the downtrodden. A rhetorician par excellence, he can make his audience consume irrelevant claims about Ayodhya being in Thori and Yoga having originated in Nepal.A relic of the print and audio era, Sharma Oli refuses to accept that historical fabrications and jingoistic stories look somewhat dubious on small screens of handheld devices. The sell-by date of Sharma Oli’s alt-right populism seems to be losing its mass appeal. It must be in desperation that he had to aim cheap and chauvinistic barbs at the fellow parliamentarian Sumana Shrestha. Born in 1974, Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane belongs to the Mahendramala Generation that grew up in the ideological hegemony of ethnonational chauvinism in the 1980s and 1990s. Setting a world record of sorts in 2013 with his single-themed and longest-running talk show, he is the political manipulator of the television age. Lamichhane succeeded in fanning popular discontent against established parties through his Sidha Kura Janata Sanga and then decided to electorally encash the adulation before the audience could know much about his dual passport, possible involvement in cooperative frauds or the vacuity of his political antics. He is no longer the poster boy for alternative politics.Performative agitator The chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), Gyanendra Bahadur Shahi, is the new kid on the jingoistic block. He is wrestling to create a space for himself in the post-2015 order where the ruling ideology is that there is no distinct ideology in the political economy. Born in 1992 and a child of restored constitutional monarchy, Shahi came of age in yet another Gramscian interregnum between 2006 and 2016 when ethnonational majoritarianism triumphed over the inclusionary dreams of participatory democracy. Experiences of electoral democracies in Pakistan or Sri Lanka have shown that ethnonational majoritarianism inevitably brings authoritarian politics, nepotism, favouritism, crony capitalism and brazen corruption. In such polities, the risk of a rabble-rouser spouting rage against the ‘rotten elite’ is extremely high. Imran Khan rode the anti-establishment beast to get to the top, where the creature ate his political career raw. He is presently cooling his heels in jail. The movement of India Against Corruption (IAC) catapulted Arvind Kejriwal to the chair of Chief Minister of New Delhi, where, ironically, he is in custody on corruption charges. Shahi tried to ride a similar escalator of anti-corruption vigilantism through his combative politics captured live on camera and beamed through social media. He became viral through his Hamro Nepal Hami Nepali Abhiyan (Our Nepal, We Nepalis Campaign) by participating in protests against the Nepal Compact of Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC). It seems the adroit agitator has realised that his jingoistic image needs periodic polishing for him to thrive in the emotionally distressed republic. He recently joined the campaign for the social rehabilitation of Sandeep Lamichhane, a celebrity cricketer first convicted of raping a minor, sentenced to jail and then acquitted by a higher court. The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had included the former captain in its T20 World Cup team. Once the USA denied him a visa, the CAN could have let the prospective player hone his spin-bowling skills at home. But it decided to solicit the help of the government to make the consular services of the US Embassy rethink. They did some serious rethinking and once again denied Lamichhane a visa. The unfortunate story should have ended there, but the anti-MCC campaigner made a grand entry, heading a procession against the US Embassy!Shahi didn’t stop there: He later claimed in Parliament that the denial of a visa to Lamichhane was an affront to the entire country. Perhaps Shahi perceives that an anti-USA constituency still exists in the country that he can mobilise for his regressive politics. He may have been too young back then, but more prominent personalities of Nepal have been refused a visa in the past. No matter how high you are within the geography of one of the 50 poorest countries of the world with one of its lowest-ranking passports, resident diplomats of wealthier nations remain unimpressed with the “Buddha was born in Nepal” rhetoric.Herd mentalityIn his long public life, Abhi Subedi has worn many hats of different hues—discarding one for the other or donning one atop another depending upon his mood—with the ease of a bohemian. He is a professor, poet, playwright, critic, academic, commentator, researcher, creator, wanderer, writer, translator, bilingual columnist and voracious reader: An intellectual in one word.Back in 2006, Subedi was brusquely denied a visa to visit New York at the invitation of American writers. He was reportedly told: “You seem to have visited so many places. How come? Are you retired? Will you return?” And then dismissed with a gratuitous advice: “Try again.” When Subedi wrote about the incident with a touch of sadness in his column “Visa and empire of indifference”, the then US Ambassador to Nepal James Francis Moriarty expressed regret at the treatment meted out to “long a cultural contact of our American Center” but refused to publicly apologise.Khagendra Sangraula—a writer and translator so popular that he needs no introduction—with the British Embassy in 2005 had a no less disturbing experience. He was given a written note explaining that the visa denial was based on the possibility that he may not leave Britain after entering. Once again, Sangraula wrote about it in the form of a letter in one of his columns, but nothing was heard from the then British Ambassador Keith G Bloomfield.Subedi and Sangraula were wise enough to realise that denial of visa is the prerogative of the issuing country. Shahi wants to capitalise on this to strengthen his capability of benefiting from the herd mentality of cynical and discontented youths who consume incendiary social media posts and are looking for an easy outlet to vent their rage. Some populists can do good for their political benefit, but a rabble-rouser inevitably causes unmitigated disaster. Shahi isn’t just a person but a political model that can prove to be much more damaging than Sharma Oli’s ethnonational populism or Lamichhane’s downright demagoguery. \nFossil fuels are being rapidly displaced by decarbonised sources of energy but not everyone is yet onboard. The resolution adopted at the end of COP28 last December was described as the \"beginning of the end\" for the fossil fuel era. While such an announcement was met with much cynicism, maybe it was indeed the turning point.The past six months have provided even more evidence that fossil fuels are being rapidly overcome by the new technologies of decarbonisation: Wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. These are now growing at super exponential rates showing that businesses, governments and communities are learning how to implement them in cities and regions.All fossil fuels are either plateauing or showing negative growth. The peaks for coal, oil and gas show how rapid their decline will be. The responses from the fossil fuel lobby have been largely of derision and instead of showing that they are in decline and must diversify into these new technologies, they have opted for even bigger growth targets.Many oil and gas projects are showing growth targets beyond 2050 into 2070, in a bid to find finance from a world that is more and more backing the net zero-only finance option as demand for fossil fuels declines.Fossil fuel lobby sows confusionThis is causing political chaos as governments are caught between supporting climate action and supporting big fossil fuel companies promising massive investment. This confuses the public. Australia is an example.In the two years since its election, the federal Labor government has created many innovative programs and funds to enable the energy transition. But at the same time it is backing oil and gas project expansion that is seven times more climate-damaging than the gains in climate mitigation from the other programs.Chevron's carbon capture and storage project at the Gorgon gas field—the biggest demonstration of the technology in the world—has failed to meet its targets, casting doubt on the continued use of gas.Overviews of the technology are increasingly casting doubts on its commercial viability. Due to their impact on the global climate it is hard to see more than a small fraction of the fossil fuel projects ever getting their finance. It’s thus likely the fossil fuel lobby strategy to push ahead—as though COP28 never happened—will begin to collapse. It's expected that COP29 will confirm the support for a rapid decline in fossil fuels.Risk of COP29 backfiringLike COP28 it will be convened by an oil and gas-based nation. But the data are beginning to make the campaigns for more fossil fuels look like childish tantrums. And the natural world has been fighting back with the climate causing severe storms like the huge floods that hit Dubai in the months after COP28. No place is safe from global warming.Finance will have the major stake as they must invest in returns that last into the 2050s and these are increasingly threatened by the data trends and the climate itself.The Australian oil and gas company Woodside had 58 percent of its shareholders vote down the company's climate strategy, including its dependence on carbon capture and storage. COP29 will backfire unless more is agreed to accelerate the phase out of fossil fuels.Fossil fuel companies will increasingly find that unless they seriously join the diversification of their investments, they will disappear.The examples of Orsted in Denmark and Neste in Finland have demonstrated diversification to renewable-based fuels is commercially feasible by companies that previously worked on fossil fuels. Much more is needed and can be expected at COP29.UN climate chief Simon Stielle has put the world on notice: \"We've got two years left to save the planet. As we inch towards the point of no return, each year takes on more importance than the last.\" But the first steps were taken at COP28 by recognising that the era of fossil fuels is over. \nThe debate on the proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2024-25, beginning July 16, has begun in the federal Parliament. The debate, though, is a mere ritual. Neither is the debate likely to change the allocation of a single rupee nor is any resource available to upscale or add projects. However, the fiscal bill has somehow rightly diagnosed the maladies that hold back the growth of the Nepali economy. Economic activities could not expand due to a fall in consumer demand, low credit expansion, low capacity of the manufacturing sector and a decline in goods imports. Yet, the growth rate in the current fiscal year is expected to be 3.9 percent at producers’ prices as against only 3.1 percent estimated by the International Monetary Fund.Also, Finance Minister Barshaman Pun hoped to take the capital expenditure to Rs215.3 billion (71.3 percent of the capital allocation) and collect Rs1,253.5 billion (88.1 percent of the target) in around six weeks of the current fiscal year that remain. Even these substantially downsized targets are unlikely to be met. By June 2, the government had spent only Rs127.85 billion (42.32 percent of the allocation) towards capital expenditure and collected a revenue of Rs873.66 billion (61.42 percent of the target).Despite acknowledging these growth constraints, the proposed fiscal policy fails to prescribe credible means to restore the confidence of consumers and investors. It is only by restoring the confidence of consumers, investors, and the market that the economy can be reinvigorated. Ironically, the finance minister instead expects appreciation for being 'unambitious' and 'pragmatic' while setting a subdued revenue target of Rs1,260 billion and allocating a capital budget of Rs352.3 billion.Bulging deficitThe FY 2024-25 budget is a hugely deficit budget by Rs547.8 billion out of the total proposed outlay of Rs1,860.3 billion. The deficit alone is 29.44 percent of the allocation and 9.6 percent of the revised gross domestic product (GDP) value of Rs5,705 billion (USD 42.5 billion). In the coming fiscal year, Rs330 billion will be raised from domestic borrowings and Rs217.7 billion from external borrowings. Even if the revenue of Rs1,260 billion projected by the budget were to be collected, the government cannot escape the current expenditure of Rs1,140.6 billion and default on debt service obligation of Rs357.3 billion.This means that the sum of revenue and domestic debt will only be enough to cover the expenditures under these two headings, thus leaving an extremely thin scope for generating resources for the Rs352.3 billion allocated for capital expenditures. On the one hand, capital allocation is barely 19 percent of the total allocation, the lowest ratio in Nepal's budget history. On the other, Nepal faces a chronic problem of underspending the earmarked capital budget. An added risk is that due to declining consumption and imports, the revenue target seems unattainable. Raising loans from external lenders has always been challenging. For example, in the current fiscal year, only half of the expected Rs213 billion would be available for the government to mobilise. If all proposed debts are realised by the next fiscal year, the public debt will climb above 52 percent of GDP.Under such resource constraints, limited economic activities from the funds transferred by the federal government to the provincial and local levels might marginally contribute to growth and development. However, capital expenditure to implement the large and transformative projects of the federal government looks bleak. This essentially means that the country's economic growth will remain constricted for a few more years.'Transformative' prioritiesThe new budget has chosen five sectors as transformative: Agriculture, energy, information technology, tourism promotion, and entrepreneurship and industrial development. There is hardly any debate or novelty in these priorities and objectives. Some initiatives like added focus, at least in theory, on information technology are certainly timely and appropriate. But even in these chosen areas, the fiscal bill has remained short of removing key policy or structural bottlenecks that are proving daunting in realising the true potentials of these sectors. These missed opportunities could have been tapped mostly without draining the exchequer.Agricultural transformation without first arranging enough land for commercial agriculture is only a pipedream. Haphazard urbanisation has taken place on the most fertile land. The arable land is fragmented into generally tiny 30 million plots under the title of 13.5 million landowners. The average plot size is 0.3 hectares. The fault lies in the ad hoc and largely failed land use planning, which the government has failed to give due attention to.On energy, Nepal first needs to develop a comprehensive blueprint for the energy economy. On the one hand, the thrill of exporting electricity has swayed national emotion; on the other, industries are demanding to meet their demand for power before exporting it at much cheaper rates than they are charged. It is appropriate to develop an automatic system of providing tariff concessions to manufacturing industries proportionate to the value addition of their products. Lack of coordination among the government agencies overseeing land, forest, environment and infrastructure development remains the main impediment in the construction of both power projects and transmission lines.Despite bullish ambitions, the government has not been designating an appropriate location for an IT park and developing it with appropriate power, communication, and transport connectivity. Nepal also needs to think beyond adventure and backpacking tourism by developing unique-value products, destinations, and infrastructure to cater to high-value tourists.The most challenging of all has been to increase productivity and create employment opportunities. The contribution of manufacturing to GDP has fallen below the 4 percent mark. Chronic underinvestment has paralysed the industrial sector. Missing both backward and forward linkages has made the 'herding' model of industries unsustainable. In all these sectors, the budget has taken only a cosmetic approach rather than putting genuine efforts into transforming them. Some key sectors under pressure due to an economic downward spiral, like real estate and housing, cooperatives, microfinance and construction, are highly disappointed with the utter neglect of the budget to address their problems.Most importantly, the government has failed to realise that without a substantive stimulus package through bold fiscal and monetary policies, the economy has reached a stage of self-recovery on its own. Nepal is destined to reel under recession for some time to come. Growth is a further distant expectation. \nChiefs and deputy chiefs of over 150 local units from across the country have gathered in Kathmandu for a common agenda—to protest against the federal government’s decision to cut the budget already allocated to them. They picketed the finance ministry at Singha Durbar on Sunday to mount pressure on the federal government to release the money. According to them, the budget earmarked under the title of equalisation grants was not distributed as earlier promised. Local units get the equalisation grants in three tranches. They were entitled to 25 percent of the total grants in the third instalment, but they got only seven percent. According to elected local representatives, the federal administration’s act of cutting the allocated budget has caused them multiple problems as they had initiated several development projects and other activities with a plan to pay with the money from the equalisation grants. With the abrupt disruption of the source, they are now in a spot of bother. The finance ministry might have its own arguments behind stopping the budget, most likely a shortfall of resources as successive governments have failed to rejuvenate the country’s economy after the covid pandemic. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government has been a failure on the economic front as it couldn’t even meet the target of revenue collection set in the annual budget. Nepali authorities have failed to apply any innovative idea or explore new resources to fill the gap. The authorities in Kathmandu could have found other ways such as applying austerity measures at the centre so as to avoid budget cuts to the local units. For one, cutting local units’ budgets won’t help the government’s goal of increasing capital expenditures.There are several options to fund development and other activities at the district, constituency and local levels. Allocation of the budget through equalisation grants is one. It is a more scientific and rational way of resource distribution as it is done in line with clear working procedures of the National Natural Resources and Finance Commission. The latest status of human development indicators including the situation of education, health and drinking water of a particular local unit or province; the situation of balanced development there; that of disparity based on economic, social or any other discrimination; the condition of infrastructure in the province and local units; the existing status and prospect of revenue generation; and the need of expenditure for the sub-national units are the criteria considered while allocating funds.The commission also takes the population of a sub-national unit as a basis to allocate budget under this category. For instance, units with less than 10,000 people get Rs1.25 million while those with more than 10,000 and upto 2 million people get additional Rs125,000 for each 10,000 increment. This shows that distribution of money under equalisation grants is to an extent rational whereas several other programmes are infamous for doling out money based on recommendation and influence of powerful political leaders and top officials at Singha Durbar.By cutting resources to local units, the government is treading a regressive path by weakening sub-national administrations—at a time it needs to devolve more authorities and resources to strengthen them as per the spirit of the federal system. The local representatives, while speaking during the sit-in at the ministry, accused the authorities of shifting development and other responsibilities to the local units while centralising resources at Singha Durbar. They are right to say that such a tendency will neither strengthen the federal system nor does it sit well with the spirit of the new constitution.  \nIn a breathtaking display of callousness to public health, two weeks into a ban on Indian spice brands Everest and MDH, their products continue to be available in the market, including on various online stores. According to officials at the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, the public need not panic as the problematic batches of these products have been pulled from the market and their import stopped. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that most stores never stopped selling these spice brands. Another of the department’s laughable excuses for its failure to examine the collected spice samples is that it lacks necessary chemicals to test for traces of ethylene oxide, which is directly linked to multiple forms of cancer. It was because of the reported presence of this chemical in the products of the two brands—as discovered in food labs in Singapore and Hong Kong—that they had to be banned in Nepal. Because of poor demand following the ban, importers say, very little of these spices is entering Nepal. Yet, here again, there is no evidence to prove that claim. This episode of tainted spices raises some troubling questions. If the country does not have basic chemicals to test for such dangerous substances in food products, how can we be sure that similar products from domestic manufacturers are not poisonous? It’s common knowledge that most tests on food products available in Nepali markets are carried out during the festive time of Dashain and Tihar. Otherwise, at other times, we seldom hear of such tests. This suggests that even the few tests undertaken are for show, and there is no long-term state commitment to ensuring public health. Many urban centres of Nepal are now witnessing dangerous levels of air pollution. Water is scarce in much of the country. Most of the food we consume, from pesticide-laden fruits and vegetables to carcinogen-containing spices, will only worsen our health. Even in general, those with lesser means suffer more adverse health outcomes. Health and food products from around the world are now readily available in our supermarkets. Those with the means can access the more expensive and safer food products while the rest have to rely on the cheapest and often the most tainted food products. Couple this with the ever-increasing healthcare costs in Nepal, and you get a stark difference in the health outcomes between the rich and the poor. One American study found that the greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and premature death, and “Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own.” Another study showed that low income is associated with a poor quality dietary intake. Similar dynamics have been observed wherever such studies have been carried out. A country that cannot ensure a minimum level of standard on the food the masses rely on cannot be called an equitable state. Food security is not just about ensuring people have enough to eat, it is as much about making sure what they eat is safe.    \nAfter months of locking horns in Parliament over Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in cooperative fraud, the government and the opposition parties have finally agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. This would not have been possible without the persistent calls of opposition parties, led by the Nepali Congress, often at the cost of disrupting the House business. It wouldn’t have been possible either without the solid investigative reporting by the mainstream media, including Kantipur daily, for which the Kantipur Media Group chairperson Kailash Sirohiya had to spend nine days in police custody as a victim of vendetta politics. Now that the committee has been formed, the question is whether it will deliver. The seven-member body is led by Surya Thapa of the CPN-UML, the party that, for the longest period, stood firmly behind Lamichhane, dismissing all calls for the committee. Other committee members are Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. At a glance, the ruling majority has a clear upper hand in the committee.What is distressing is that the committee’s terms of reference do not include Lamichhane’s name, who is at the eye of the storm in the fraud case. We should not forget that the alleged involvement of a deputy prime minister and home minister in embezzling hundreds of million rupees of common people’s hard-earned savings led to the committee’s formation. The inclusion of Gorkha Media Network, the company where he was managing director and where he allegedly parked the fraudulently acquired money, was the second best option, and the opposition parties were compelled to compromise on this score. Thankfully, the names of a slew of other cooperatives that have come into the radar for fraudulent transactions have been mentioned in the committee’s ToR. The idea, ultimately, is to provide justice to all victims across the country and punish the culprits.The committee members should work earnestly to take the probe to a logical conclusion. Governments and coalitions come and go, in light of how Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has had to take the vote of confidence four times in less than a year and a half. Fair investigation will be vital for a credible parliamentary probe. Previous probe committees have had a poor record of either failing to investigate properly or sweeping the findings under the rug. The report of the parliamentary probe committee on the caste-killing of Ajit Mijar, for instance, is yet to be published even after eight, long years. The new committee to investigate cooperatives should look to change that image. The investigation should neither be inspired by vendetta against anyone, including Lamichhane, nor by a desire to cleanse his name or those of anyone else found guilty of misappropriating people’s hard-earned money. It is thus vital that the committee, right at the start, builds an environment of trust by committing to a free and fair investigation. This should include open discussions on the matter and clear and consistent communication on the committee’s working and findings. Only then will the hundreds of thousands of victims of cooperative frauds get the justice they seek. \nLawmaker Jivan Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International's Secretary General's visit to Nepal highlighted concerns about backsliding human rights globally, including shrinking civic space, excessive force during protests, impunity, and the erosion of media freedom, emphasizing that peace cannot be sustainable without justice.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), established in 2021 after a split from the CPN-UML, prepares for its first general convention, navigating challenges in policy implementation, internal division, and coalition stability.\nThe UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, highlights Nepal's development progress and discusses its challenges in LDC graduation, SDG achievement, resource mobilization, climate change impacts, peace consolidation, and Nepal's role in UN and international forums.\nThe budget session of Nepal's federal parliament kicks off amidst unresolved differences over a probe committee on cooperative fraud allegations against a key minister, raising uncertainties about the session's productivity and the endorsement of several bills.\nCloudy conditions prevail nationwide with light rain and possible snowfall in some areas, especially in eastern, central, western, and mid-western regions.\nLocal winds brought rainfall to Kathmandu Valley on Tuesday, providing relief from the heat; the monsoon is expected to arrive on June 13.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with chances of precipitation (rain, thunder, lightning, snowfall) in various regions of Nepal, including gusts of wind in some areas; Nepalgunj recorded the highest temperature (40.2°C) while Jumla recorded the lowest minimum temperature (10.8°C).\nPartly cloudy skies, scattered rainfall in hilly areas, potential thunderstorms, with varying temperatures across Nepal.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nMadhesh Chief Minister Saroj Kumar Yadav lost his position on Wednesday, 17 months into his appointment, after failing to secure a vote of confidence during a floor test in the provincial assembly.A meeting of the provincial assembly rejected the motion tabled by the chief minister seeking the assembly’s trust.Assembly Speaker Ramchandra Mandal announced that of the 103 members present, 50 members of the assembly voted in favour of his motion while 53 voted against. In the 107-strong Madhesh assembly, the support of 54 assembly members is required for a simple majority.The federal coalition of the Maoist Centre, the CPN-UML and the Janamat Party, among others, is set to stake claim to a new government in the province. CPN (Maoist Centre) leader Yuvaraj Bhattarai claimed that although 53 assembly members voted against Yadav on Wednesday, the new coalition has 55 votes in the assembly and its candidate will swiftly win the chief ministership.“Assembly members representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party were absent during the trust vote, but they are with us,” Bhattarai told the Post. The two parties each have an assembly member. With 25 members, the CPN-UML is the largest party in Madhesh provincial assembly, while the Congress is second-largest with 22 members. Likewise, the JSP-Nepal has 19, the Janamat Party 13, the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal 9, the CPN (Maoist Centre) 9, the CPN (Unified Socialist) 7 and the Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, the Nagarik Unmukti Party and the Rastriya Prajatantra Party one each.Earlier, leaders from the CPN-UML, the CPN (Maoist Centre), and the CPN (Unified Socialist) had reportedly agreed to form the provincial government in Madhesh under the leadership of CK Raut-led Janamat party’s provincial assembly leader. On May 30, Janamat Party chair Raut had announced that the federal coalition members including Mahantha Thakur-led Loktantrik Samajbadi Party Nepal would support his party to form the government in Madhesh. However, leaders from Thakur’s party and the Unified Socialist had said they have yet to make an official decision.Yadav, provincial assembly leader of the Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal, was appointed the chief minister on January 11, 2023.The Yadav-led provincial government lost the majority after the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre) withdrew their support on May 12.The chief minister went for the floor test as per the mandatory provision of the constitution. This provision requires a chief minister to undergo a floor test within 30 days if the party the chief minister represents splits or a coalition partner withdraws its support.Upendra Yadav’s parties, including the current JSP-Nepal, had been in power in Madhesh Province for nearly seven consecutive years. Yadav formed several parties over the past seven years through splits or mergers. The latest split of Yadav’s JSP-Nepal happened on May 5, when its federal chair Ashok Rai, backed by several senior leaders, launched a new Janata Samajbadi Party. The Election Commission recognised the new party on May 6, compelling Chief Minister Yadav to undergo a floor test as per Article 188 (2) of the Constitution. “If the political party which the Chief Minister represents is divided or a political party in coalition Government withdraws its support, the Chief Minister shall table a resolution in the State Assembly for a vote of confidence within thirty days,” reads the Article of the Constitution. Earlier, Chief Minister Yadav had planned to defer the trust vote. He had requested the assembly to reschedule the vote for Monday next week, citing his poor health. However, he later agreed to face the assembly due to fear of ‘automatically’ losing the position. Leaders from rival parties had claimed that Yadav would lose the position based on the date of the split of the JSP-Nepal if he refused to undergo a floor test. There were also legal questions over the requirement for floor test as the Supreme Court, acting on a petition by Upendra Yadav, has ordered the election body to freeze the registration of the Ashok Rai-led party, until a final verdict.On Wednesday evening, Province Head Sumitra Bhandari invited parties for government formation in accordance with Article 168(2) of the Constitution. The parties have until 10 am Friday to submit their claims. The provision states that in cases where no party has a clear majority in the assembly under clause(1), the Province Head shall appoint as the chief minister a member of the assembly who can command a majority with the support of two or more parties representing the provincial assembly.The new chief minister will be required to secure the confidence of the provincial assembly within 30 days of appointment. With Wednesday’s trust vote, Upendra Yadav’s party has been ousted from power six and a half years after the first provincial assembly elections. Previously, Yadav’s aide Lal Babu Raut served a full five-year term as chief minister of the province. \nOn February 7, the Supreme Court overturned the decision of the erstwhile KP Sharma Oli government to allow the Jhapa-based Giri Bandhu Tea Estate to swap land exceeding its legal ownership ceiling with plots in any other place within the Koshi Province.With the Supreme Court issuing its full text of the verdict on May 11, opposition party leaders have started questioning the CPN-UML about “policy corruption” committed in the process.The Nepali Congress leaders have demanded a probe into the Oli government’s decision. Even Kathmandu Mayor Balendra Shah has joined the chorus accusing Oli, who is also the UML chairman, of illegally swapping tea estate land, citing it as a clear case of policy corruption.The criticism from different quarters has put the UML on the defensive. And Oli is unable to hide his annoyance as questions come from all directions. His party is now defending the decision saying that the land swap was based on an amendment to the Land Act effected through a unanimous decision of the federal parliament.“No party opposed the Act’s amendment. The Nepali Congress also did not register any revision to the [amendment] bill. All the parties jointly passed the law,” said Yogesh Bhattarai, claiming it was wrong to accuse Oli and his party on the matter. He went on to say that the parties that helped revise that Act were now pointing fingers at the UML as the revision had been made without their notice.Against his claim, the Nepali Congress had registered amendments to the bill. Some of its lawmakers like Radheshyam Adhikari had criticised it strongly in the Upper House. However, it wasn't objected to by the Congress while endorsing it.Experts say this is an example of how laws are passed in Nepal. The executive includes provisions that allow for policy corruption, and these are endorsed as lawmakers do not care to engage in a thorough study and deliberations over the bill.“Policy corruption at the executive level can be checked if the lawmakers are vigilant and lawmaking is transparent,” Khimlal Devkota, a former National Assembly member who has closely studied Nepal’s law-making process, told the Post.Policy decisions in Nepal have become rather controversial. Cabinet decisions are deemed to be among such decisions. Even though the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority Act-1991 is silent on what constitutes a policy decision, the Supreme Court in 1996 sought to define it.As per the 1996 verdict issued by then-chief justice Surendra Prasad Singh and justices Keshav Prasad Upadhyaya, Laxman Prasad Aryal, Kedar Nath Upadhyay and Udayaraj Upadhyaya, decisions taken ‘collectively’ by the Cabinet to fulfil promises made in the election manifesto constitute ‘policy decisions’.Nepali politicians have long been spared from prosecution as decisions made in the Cabinet are termed policy decisions. The anti-graft body has directed the government and Parliament to define what constitutes a ‘policy decision’. Anti-corruption activists have also been seeking clarity on the concept for the same reason.The Oli government presented a bill to amend the Land Act in 2019. It was endorsed by both houses of the federal parliament in January 2020. Based on the new law, the Oli government on April 26, 2021 allowed the Giri Bandhu Tea Estate owners to swap 343.19 bighas (1 bigha equals 6,773 square metres) of land occupied by the tea estate. The decision was challenged in the Supreme Court. A constitutional bench of the court revoked the decision ruling it illegal.The opposition started lashing out at Oli and his party after the court verdict and its full text. This was not the first time that Parliament passed the bill unanimously and realised later that the executive had mala fide intent. On December 24, 2018, the government registered a bill in the federal parliament to amend a few laws. It included a proposal to revise the Nepal Trust Act. The bill revising 56 different laws was tabled for deliberations in the House of Representatives on January 1, 2019 and it was endorsed on February 15 unopposed. The National Assembly endorsed it on March 2 that year, before President Bidya Devi Bhandari authenticated it the very next day. However, the issue came to light only when the Oli government decided to lease out the land under the trust to the Yeti Group. Even the lawmakers who had voted for the revision criticised the law, having overlooked the issue during deliberations in the House.Legal experts say such incidents happen when the lawmaking process is not participatory and parliamentarians show little interest in study and deliberations. “The lawmaking process must be participatory right from its drafting process. It must be discussed widely in the House to make sure that it serves a right cause,” said advocate Mohan Acharya. Amid widespread criticism that law-making lacks broad participation, a bill is under consideration in the House to ensure that legislation becomes a more consultative process.“The bill, if passed, will ensure that bills are drafted after proper consultations with all stakeholders. They will be widely discussed before endorsement,” said Devkota. “In federal countries, central governments discuss bills with the provinces before tabling them in Parliament. Had this been done, there would not have been scams like Giri Bandhu.”Besides, the Pushpa Kamal Dahal government is creating a mechanism for turning legislation into a more consultative process. Talking to law students on Sunday, Minister for Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Padam Giri said the government was creating a Suggestion Bank to receive feedback on bills. “Such feedback and suggestions will be incorporated in the bills,” he said. \nWith the monsoon just around the corner, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has finally started repairing the Sisdole road that leads to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district. Officials said they started fixing potholes, concreting and other works on Wednesday.“We have allocated Rs30 million for the repairs, and the work started on Wednesday after completing the tender process,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC). “We have asked the contractor to complete the work at the earliest in view of the looming monsoon.”Every year, garbage disposal is affected during the monsoon season due to rain, landslides, and poor road conditions. Sometimes, garbage disposal is disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions result in a complete halt in door-to-door garbage collection for weeks, leading locals in the Valley to discard their trash on the streets and causing chaos in the city.“We are aware of the risks associated with obstructions in garbage disposal and their consequences,” said Shrestha. “We have been taking measures accordingly to lessen all possible risks.”The metropolis said that around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised.Meteorologists in Nepal anticipate the onset of monsoon by the end of next week, a few days ahead of the usual June 13 arrival of the weather system from the Bay of Bengal.KMC is also considering purchasing a high-pressure pump to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground. Recently, locals in the Sisdole area protested and stopped the trucks from disposing of garbage alleging the KMC’s negligence in leachate control.Municipal officials said that the Ministry of Urban Development took away a high-pressure pumpset from the landfill site's leachate pond some three months ago for maintenance, but has yet to return it. Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The city office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nOver a week after its formation, the parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives has started drafting its working procedure necessary to commence the probe.The first meeting of the parliamentary panel on Wednesday tasked the officials of the Parliament Secretariat deputed to the committee with drafting the working procedure by Thursday.“Our meeting on Friday will endorse the working procedure after reviewing the draft by the officials,” Ishwari Neupane, a member of the committee from the Nepali Congress, told the Post. “We will probably start the investigation from Sunday.”After weeks of negotiations between the ruling and opposition parties, a seven-member committee led by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa was constituted on May 28 to investigate the embezzlement of deposits in dozens of cooperatives around the country.Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party are the members of the committee.It took over a week since the committee was formed for its first meeting as Thapa was in his home district Pyuthan for some days. Talking to the journalists after the meeting, Thapa said they are committed to completing the investigation within the three-month deadline. “We will work day and night to complete our job within the deadline,” Thapa said.The officials will prepare the working procedure within the framework finalised by the task force led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs.The Giri-led panel had agreed on four terms of reference (ToR) for the probe committee.As per the ToR, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk.Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problematic cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network, which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and other companies and organisations.It will also investigate the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in the illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations for recovering the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations.Cooperatives that injected money into Gorkha Media Network are Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative.It took weeks for the parties to agree on the ToR for the committee as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after all the cooperatives linked with the Gorkha Media Network were subjected to probe. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal will witness the swearing-in of Narendra Modi as Indian prime minister on Saturday.Amrit Rai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, confirmed with the Post that Prime Minister Dahal will visit New Delhi to attend the oath-taking ceremony.Rai said the foreign ministry is finalising the delegates who will travel with the prime minister to the Indian capital city.Modi will assume office as prime minister for a historic third consecutive term after the Bharatiya Janata Party-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats in the recent elections. Modi is only the second leader to win a third term after founding Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru.In 2014, the then Prime Minister Sushila Koirala attended Modi’s oath-taking ceremony when he was elected prime minister for the first time.The Indian government has invited heads of government from other Saarc countries for the swearing-in ceremony.Prime Minister Dahal congratulated Modi on his election victory on Tuesday.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The prime minister also held a telephone conversation with Modi.“Happy to speak with PM @cmprachanda. Thanked him for his warm wishes,” Modi said in a post on X. “We reaffirmed our shared commitment to bolster the deep-rooted and multifaceted partnership between India and Nepal, and agreed to sustain the positive momentum in our relations.”Also, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli, among other leaders from Nepal, congratulated the Indian leader on his election.  \nIndustrialists on Wednesday said that the provision of advance income tax on food and pulses imposed by the government through the budget would increase prices by at least 30 percent, warning that the country’s inflation may balloon if immediate measures are not taken.Nepal Rice Oil Dal Industry Association, Nepal Flour Industry Association, and Livestock Feed Industry Association held a joint press meeting to criticise the government's move, which they say would not only increase the prices but may also put the food industry on the edge of bankruptcy.This is because the rise in prices in the domestic market will fuel smuggling from bordering towns in India where these products are cheaper, said Kumud Kumar Dugad, president of the Nepal Rice Oil and Dal Industry Association.Through the Financial Bill, the government has provisioned collecting 2.5 percent advance income tax on rice imports and 10 percent on pulse imports.“This is totally irrational. This shows that the government is not serious towards the consumers and sensitive industries like the food industry,” said Dugar. He questioned the rationale behind the advance tax imposed on food imports and the principle of taxation.He said that the price of a bag of rice (25 kg) has increased by Rs100 since the introduction of the advance tax, and the price of pulses has increased by Rs20 per kg.A study titled ‘Dynamics of informal cross-border trade in agricultural products between Nepal and India’, undertaken by the South Asia Watch on Trade, Economics and Environment (SAWTEE) in partnership with the International Food Policy Research Institute, lists rice as a key commodity ‘highly informally’ imported from India to Nepal.The paper said that only 40 percent of rice is imported to Nepal from India through the formal channel. The research shows that informal trade has thrived after the imposition of a 9 percent agriculture reform fee and a 2.5 percent advanced income tax, leading to a total duty of 11.5 percent on rice imports.India, on the other hand, often bans the export of rice and other food commodities.With this variation, prices in Nepal and India differ by 18-20 percent, or rice in India becomes cheaper by at least 18 percent.The paper said that India's ban on rice and other agricultural exports has led to massive smuggling of food through the 1,800 km porous border between Nepal and India.Hemraj Dhakal, vice president of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry, said that the government should withdraw such tax. “The taxation policy has harmed the domestic industry.” Various representatives from the Birgunj Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Siddharthnagar Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Nepal Chamber of Commerce, and the Confederation of Nepalese Industries have also demanded that the advance tax on food items be rolled back.Subodh Kumar Gupta, former president of the Association of Nepalese Rice, Oil and Pulses Industries, said that the government is losing revenue as illegal imports have thrived. “The new tax policy will not only make food items expensive, it will kill the domestic industry as well,\" he said. The private sector has also criticised the government's move to increase customs duty on sponge iron. The import duty on sponge iron has been raised from 1 percent to 2.5 percent. Both scrap and pig iron, which previously had zero import duty, are subjected to a 1 percent import duty. Nepal Iron Rod Producers’ Association also held a press conference in Kathmandu on Wednesday saying that the government’s new tax policy has put the Rs36 billion industry in jeopardy. The association expressed concerns that the government's decision will negatively impact industrialisation in the country in the long run.Meanwhile, Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun on Wednesday told Parliament that the domestic market would be protected by the advance income tax on imports of food commodities.He told lawmakers that the 10 percent advance income tax was levied for import substitution.\"This naturally will make imported goods more expensive. Our agricultural markets will be protected,\" he said, adding that he had taken a “correct” move. Pun said that VAT has been removed from potatoes, onions and fruits. \nThe National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party, has clinched a victory for the third consecutive term in the Indian parliamentary elections, paving the way for Prime Minister Narendra Modi to continue his hold on power. As the results poured in, Modi addressed the public in a televised speech in which he termed the NDA’s victory a “historic feat”. Modi also used the opportunity to list out what he called achievements of his 10-year stint as the prime minister—poverty alleviation, employment generation, economic growth, and so on. But his gait during the speech, and the spirit of the BJP leaders appearing on talk shows on television channels close to the BJP, suggested something was amiss. After months of pompously claiming that the NDA would cross the 400-seat mark in the 543-strong parliament, Modi was finally coming back to reality with a humble 293 seats, while the BJP’s own tally was 240, well below the 272 mark for a majority. Even more distressing for Modi was that the opposition alliance, INDIA, secured 230 seats, a feat even the opposition parties themselves had not expected considering the BJP’s hubris in the run-up to the elections. This was certainly a humbling moment for Modi. An important message the Indian electorate has given Modi, the BJP and the NDA is that there is only so much you can gain from the politics of religion. Coming on the heels of a massive campaign to “reinstate” Lord Ram in Ayodhya, the election was seen as a referendum on Modi’s Hindutva politics. The results have shown that the Indian citizens are not as excited as Modi and his partyfolk about the idea of establishing a “Ram Rajya”. Anti-incumbency aside, the falling numbers—the BJP got 303 seats, and the NDA 353 seats in the 2019 parliamentary elections—are a tell-tale sign of the voters’ dissatisfaction with where India is headed as the living conditions of most people remained largely unchanged amid growing economic disparities. Another humbling prospect for Modi is having to share the stage with N Chandrababu Naidu of Andhra Pradesh and Nitish Kumar of Bihar. The fact that the opposition alliance is now strong enough to lure Naidu and Nitish into their camp—especially with Nitish earning the nickname “Paltu Babu” owing to his history of changing alliances—must have come as a hard truth for Modi, who has wielded a strong hand over governance during his two terms. This could mean that India is headed back to the days of coalition raj, much like in the nineties when small political parties that had emerged from the fringes came to the mainstream and played kingmakers, thus destabilising governments much like in present-day Nepal. How a humbled Modi will negotiate the terms of coalition politics will be for us to see in the coming days. But what the Indian electorate has proven, through the world’s largest electoral machinery, is that democracy is a daily plebiscite. No matter how fool-proof an image you build of yourself as an invincible leader on the back of a subservient media, there is a community of silent voters waiting for the right moment to make a course correction. That the Indian electorate has shattered the prospect of establishing a ‘one party state’ in the globe’s largest democracy will also give heart to those fighting for democratic rights everywhere in the world.  \nThe Indian election results have been announced, and the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) emerged as the winner despite the resurgence of the opposition conglomerate INDIA. It is expected that India’s foreign policy towards its neighbours will continue with its ‘neighbourhood first’ and ‘first responder’ policies. In the past 10 years of the Modi government, the focus has largely remained on infrastructure and connectivity with the neighbourhood to strengthen the region’s economic integration. Moreover, India’s foreign policy continues from the previous Congress-led United Progressive Alliance government, as there is a basic underlying consensus among the political parties on the contours of India’s neighbourhood policy. The primacy of this policy has been based on stability in the neighbourhood, which has a salutary effect on India’s stability and economic development in the border areas. This cannot be separated from economic development in neighbouring countries and the establishment of broader partnerships in a geo-economic sense.Manifestos and foreign policy Manifestos provide a glimpse into political parties’ thinking on foreign policy. However, policy decisions are made considering larger geopolitical developments, India’s security imperatives and geo-economic impulses in the context of other significant global players and their regional interests. In the recent election, the manifestos of all major political parties focused on domestic issues. Unlike in the past, the Bharatiya Janata Party’s (BJP) manifesto focused on ‘Bharat first’ foreign policy. Leading the global south has always been a priority of India’s foreign policy, evident in the Non-alignment policy, South-South cooperation, Group of 77 and Afro-Asian conference, where India played a leading role. Interestingly, the Modi government prioritised the global south when it took the G20 Presidency in 2023. Notably, the government’s policy on Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) is mentioned in the section on surakshit bharat.Humanitarian assistance and disaster relief are other areas that India has focused on in the past as its outreach has expanded through maritime collaboration and strengthening vision through the Security and Growth for All in the Region (SAGAR) policy. As India’s emphasis on infrastructure grows, the India-Middle East-Economic Corridor—the Modi government’s initiative—will get a boost along with the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC). Additionally, the development of Chabahar Port will provide an edge to India’s economic outreach. Developing strategic partnerships for mineral security would be a new initiative of the incoming NDA government. Digital public infrastructure has always been the Modi government’s priority. Perhaps considering the voters from the southern states of India, the BJP spoke of establishing Thiruvalluvar cultural centres worldwide in its manifesto. It is, however, unclear where this centre would be in addition to the Indian Cultural centres that India has established across the world. Energy security, green energy and border infrastructure would remain important, and this is where an attempt would be made to connect with neighbours. The master plan for Purvodaya integrated infrastructure development for the Eastern states of India would boost infrastructure development in the Eastern part of South Asia, as BBIN and BIMSTEC nations are contiguous to this region. Both the BJP and Indian National Congress (INC) are committed to opposing terrorism in all its forms and taking steps to counter state-sponsored terrorism. There has been a larger political consensus on this issue in the past. Dialogue with Pakistan will not be possible in the near future unless Islamabad commits to taking steps to ensure that its territory is not used for terrorism against India. One has seen the military government of Musharraf pledge in the past. Moreover, India’s stand on removing Article 370 is non-negotiable, and there is a broad political consensus.The Indian National Congress has emphasised free trade and a rule-based international order. It is important to note that the INC and its INDIA partner would ‘uphold continuity in India’s foreign policy’ as promised in its manifesto. Therefore, there will not be any divergence in India’s foreign policy in general and in its neighbourhood in particular. The INC’s manifesto also emphasises the global south and multilateral institutions. Neighbourhood policyThe BJP will continue its policies towards India’s neighbours, prioritising robust economic partnership through trade, infrastructure and energy connectivity, which will spur growth. Its manifesto touched on the government's broader foreign policy agenda, with an emphasis on ‘neighbourhood first’. The INC, however, has made special efforts to outline its approach towards India’s neighbourhood. It is important to note that the foreign policy approach of the opposition is crucial because they are members of the Parliamentary Committee on External Affairs, where issues of foreign policy are discussed threadbare in which the opposition participates. The INC has devoted a section to India’s neighbourhood, for example, prioritising India’s special relationship with Nepal and Bhutan to ensure a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s relationship with Nepal has been unstable over the territorial dispute, and both are currently discussing ways to resolve the issue. Both INC and BJP emphasise negotiation to resolve problems between India and Nepal. They are enhancing the economic and cultural relationship with Bangladesh, which is already on track, especially the economic relationship with Bangladesh where bilateral trade is touching almost $18 billion. It needs to be underlined that during Manmohan Singh’s government, India had extended zero tariffs on 61 products—out of which 48 products were related to Bangladesh’s garment industries, which is a major contributor to the nation’s GDP. The INC also speaks of enhancing the political and economic relationship with Sri Lanka. On both economic and political counts, ECTA is still under negotiation, even though the Tamil ethnic issue remains a problem. India has emphasised addressing the grievances of Tamils in Sri Lanka, which also has implications for India as it continues to host Tamil refugees who fled Sri Lanka due to the ethnic conflict there. Sri Lanka is poised for the presidential election, followed by the parliamentary election this year. These issues would remain hotly debated in Sri Lanka’s domestic politics. In this context, regional parties in Tamil Nadu would be essential in shaping India’s policy towards Sri Lanka. The INC has promised to repair the relationship with the Maldives. However, the Modi government has taken steps to engage with the Muizzu government in the Maldives to ensure that the relationship does not suffer from the nationalist electoral rhetoric that was a part of Muizzu’s election campaign. Though INC is candid about human rights violations in Myanmar, it is unlikely that India would adopt any stringent measures against Myanmar’s military regime especially when India’s vital security interests are at stake. It is equally concerned about the cross-border implications of the conflict in Myanmar on its population in the ethnically volatile North East region.Wither foreign policyBoth the incumbent BJP’s manifesto and that of the INC, which would be in opposition, suggest that there will be no drastic changes in foreign policy. The manifestos are not divergent, and the sum and substance remain the same. Both parties have similar views on resuming dialogue with Pakistan. There is an emphasis on infrastructure development that has now become an integral part of trade and economic integration. A stable neighbourhood is entwined with India’s security, given the porosity of the border and ethnocultural cross-border linkages. The political parties in India know that a stakeholder’s approach to each other’s prosperity and security would shape a mutually beneficial relationship. India’s global outreach and place in the emerging global order would shape its foreign policy. \nIn the 2024 Indian elections, the ruling BJP lost its grip on Faizabad due to public backlash against its hate-filled politics, signifying a setback for Modi's divisive rhetoric and the rise of opposition.\nNepalese dairy farmers face ongoing financial hardship due to unpaid dues from private companies despite previous agreements, highlighting the government's neglect of the agricultural sector, leading to reduced income for farmers and higher prices for consumers.\nIsrael targeted a Gaza school on Thursday that it said contained a Hamas compound, killing fighters involved in the Oct. 7 attack that sparked the eight-month war, but Gaza media said the strike killed at least 27 people seeking shelter.Ismail Al-Thawabta, the director of the Hamas-run government media office, rejected Israel's claims that the UN school in Nuseirat, in central Gaza, had hidden a Hamas command post.“The occupation uses lying to the public opinion through false fabricated stories to justify the brutal crime it conducted against dozens of displaced people,” Thawabta told Reuters.Israel's military said that before the strike by Israeli fighter jets, the military took steps to reduce the risk of harm to civilians.The attack happened after Israel announced a new military campaign in central Gaza as it battles a group of fighters relying on hit-and-run insurgency tactics. Israel has said there will be no halt to fighting during ceasefire talks.In an apparent blow to a truce proposal touted last week by US President Joe Biden, the leader of Hamas on Wednesday said the group would demand a permanent end to the war in Gaza and Israeli withdrawal as part of a ceasefire plan.The remarks by Ismail Haniyeh appeared to deliver the Palestinian militant group’s reply to the proposal that Biden unveiled last week. Washington had said it was waiting to hear an answer from Hamas to what Biden described as an Israeli initiative.“The movement and factions of the resistance will deal seriously and positively with any agreement that is based on a comprehensive ending of the aggression and the complete withdrawal and prisoners swap,” Haniyeh said.Asked whether Haniyeh's remarks amounted to the group’s reply to Biden, a senior Hamas official replied to a text message from Reuters with a “thumbs up” emoji.Since a brief week-long truce in November, all attempts to arrange a ceasefire have failed, with Hamas insisting on its demand for a permanent end to the conflict, while Israel says it is prepared to discuss only temporary pauses until the militant group is defeated.Washington is still pressing hard to reach an agreement. CIA director William Burns met senior officials from mediators Qatar and Egypt on Wednesday in Doha to discuss the ceasefire proposal.Biden has repeatedly declared that ceasefires were close over the past several months, only for no truce to materialise.Last week’s announcement came with far greater fanfare from the White House, and at a time when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is under mounting domestic political pressure to chart a path to end the eight-month-old war and negotiate the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas.Hamas, which rules Gaza, precipitated the war by attacking Israeli territory on Oct 7, killing around 1,200 people and capturing more than 250 hostages, according to Israeli tallies. Around half of the hostages were freed in the war’s only truce so far, which lasted a week in November.Israel’s military assault on Gaza has killed more than 36,000 people, according to health officials in the territory, who say thousands more dead are feared buried under the rubble.Meanwhile, a conflict between Israel and the Lebanon-based Hezbollah is threatening to escalate, with the U.S. State Department warning against a full-blown war.ISRAEL LUKEWARMAlthough Biden described the ceasefire proposal as an Israeli offer, Israel's government has been lukewarm in public. A top Netanyahu aide confirmed on Sunday that Israel had made the proposal even though it was \"not a good deal\".Far-right members of Netanyahu’s government have pledged to quit if he agrees to a peace deal that leaves Hamas in place, a move that could force a new election and end the political career of Israel’s longest-serving leader.Centrist opponents who joined Netanyahu’s war cabinet in a show of unity at the outset of the conflict have also threatened to quit, saying his government has no plan.Meanwhile, Defence Minister Yoav Gallant said there would be no let-up in Israel’s offensive while negotiations over the ceasefire proposal were under way.“Any negotiations with Hamas would be conducted only under fire,” Gallant said in remarks carried by Israeli media after he flew aboard a warplane to inspect the Gaza front.The armed wings of Hamas and Islamic Jihad said they had fought gun battles with Israeli forces on Wednesday in areas throughout the enclave and fired anti-tank rockets and shells.Two children were among the dead laid out on Wednesday in the city’s Al Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, one of the last hospitals functioning in Gaza. Mourners said the children had been killed along with their mother, who had been unable to leave when others in the neighbourhood did.“This is not war, it is destruction that words are unable to express” said their father Abu Mohammed Abu Saif. \nRussian President Vladimir Putin said on Wednesday he could deploy conventional missiles within striking distance of the United States and its European allies if they allowed Ukraine to strike deeper into Russia with long-range Western weapons.Putin, in his first face-to-face meeting with senior editors of international news agencies since the war in Ukraine began, said the West was wrong to assume Russia would never use nuclear weapons, and said the Kremlin’s nuclear doctrine should not be taken lightly.When asked about NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg’s calls to allow Ukraine to use Western weapons to strike Russian territory, Putin differentiated between different missiles but warned allowing Kyiv to strike Russia with ever more powerful weapons was a serious escalation that was drawing the West towards a war with Russia.Russia’s response, the 71-year-old Kremlin chief said, would be to shoot down the Western missiles, and specifically mentioned US ATACMS, and British and French missile systems.c“If we see that these countries are being drawn into a war against the Russian Federation, then we reserve the right to act in the same way. In general, this is a path to very serious problems,” Putin said.Putin did not give specifics of where he was considering delivering such missiles.President Joe Biden authorized Kyiv to launch some US-supplied weapons at military targets inside Russia. Washington still prohibits Kyiv from striking Russia with ATACMS, which have a range of up to 186 miles (300 km), and other long-range US-supplied weapons.British Foreign Secretary David Cameron, during a visit to Kyiv on May 3, told Reuters Ukraine had a right to use the weapons provided by Britain to strike targets inside Russia, and it was up to Kyiv whether to do so.NUCLEAR RISKSpeaking to journalists for more than three hours at the newly built 81-floor Gazprom tower ahead of the annual St. Petersburg International Economic Forum, Putin touched on subjects from the war in Gaza to the upcoming US election.“No one in the United States is interested in Ukraine, they are interested in the greatness of the United States, which is fighting not for Ukraine and the Ukrainian people, but for its own greatness.”Putin said Russia did not care who the next US president was but said the US court system was clearly being used in a political battle against Republican nominee Donald Trump.“They are burning themselves from the inside, their state, their political system ... It is obvious all over the world that the prosecution of Trump, especially in court on charges that were formed on the basis of events that happened years ago, without direct proof, is simply using the judicial system in an internal political struggle,” said Putin.More than two years into the deadliest land war in Europe since World War Two, Putin is increasingly talking of the risk of a global conflict as the West grapples with what to do about the advance of Russian troops in Ukraine.When asked about the risk of nuclear war, Putin said Russia’s nuclear doctrine allowed the use of such weapons.“For some reason, the West believes that Russia will never use it,” Putin said when asked by Reuters about the risk of nuclear escalation over Ukraine during more than three hours of questioning.“We have a nuclear doctrine, look what it says. If someone’s actions threaten our sovereignty and territorial integrity, we consider it possible for us to use all means at our disposal. This should not be taken lightly, superficially.”Russia’s published 2020 nuclear doctrine sets out the conditions under which a Russian president would consider using a nuclear weapon: broadly as a response to an attack using nuclear or other weapons of mass destruction, or to the use of conventional weapons against Russia “when the very existence of the state is put under threat.”NATO ATTACK?Putin casts the conflict in Ukraine as part of an existential battle with a declining and decadent West which he says humiliated Russia after the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 by encroaching on what he considers Moscow’s sphere of influence, including Ukraine.Putin said the West refused to speak about the causes of the war - which he said started in 2014 after a pro-Russian president was toppled in Ukraine’s Maidan Revolution. Putin cast it as a U.S.-backed coup.The West describes the invasion as an imperial-style land grab and has vowed to help Ukraine defeat Russian forces.Ukraine says it will not rest until every last Russian soldier is ejected from the areas of Ukraine they control and which Moscow now considers to be parts of Russia.Western leaders and Ukraine have played down Russia’s warnings about the risk of a broader war involving Russia but have repeatedly warned Putin might attack a member of NATO, the world’s most powerful military alliance.Both Putin and Biden have said that a direct conflict between Russia, the world’s biggest nuclear power, and U.S.-led NATO would be a step towards World War Three.“You should not make Russia out to be the enemy. You’re only hurting yourself with this, you know?” Putin said.“They thought that Russia wanted to attack NATO. Have you gone completely crazy? That is as thick as this table. Who came up with this? It is just complete nonsense, you know? Total rubbish.” \nA passenger train crashed into a freight train in Pardubice, Czech Republic late Wednesday, killing four and injuring over 20.\nPartly to generally cloudy skies with light rain and snowfall in parts of Nepal, with temperatures ranging from 11.5°C to 40.2°C.\nHima Bista, director of Women LEAD Nepal, uses her passion for reading to enhance leadership sessions by citing credible sources and promoting a reading culture among young women.\nA man attempted self-immolation in Kathmandu after allegedly setting his own family on fire on Tuesday.According to Deputy Superintendent of Police Keshav Thebe, 55-year-old Chanchal Bahadur Singh, who was in an inebriated state, sprinkled kerosene over his wife Bindu, and their three daughters, aged 24, 16 and eight, and set them on fire in Saraswatinagar of Chabahil.Singh then attempted self-immolation, police said.All of them have been admitted to the Kirtipur Hospital for treatment.The 24-year-old and the teenager have been admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) as they have sustained 55 percent and 80 percent burns to their bodies, respectively.The others have sustained eight to 10 percent burn wounds, the hospital said. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli have congratulated Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi for his party’s victory in the 2024 elections.Dahal took to X to ‘note the successful completion of the world’s largest democratic exercise with the enthusiastic participation of the people of India’ as Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party won 240 seats in the 543-member lower house.The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) secured 293 seats, 21 more than the 272 needed to form a government.“Congratulations to PM @narendramodi on the electoral success of BJP and NDA in the Loksabha elections for the third consecutive term,” reads the prime minister’s post.Congress President Deuba, who is also the leader of the main opposition, also took to social media X to congratulate the Indian prime minister.“Congratulations to @narendramodi ji, a great friend of Nepal, on securing a third consecutive term as Prime Minister of India following the BJP and NDA's victory,” former prime minister Deuba wrote on Wednesday. “Your leadership, dedication, and vision continue to inspire and shape a bright future for India.”Likewise, CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli joined the leaders to congratulate the Indian leader.“I congratulate the Indian people for their great democratic exercise,” former prime minister Oli said on X. “I wish for your continued success in driving India’s progress and prosperity.” \nIsraeli shelling and airstrikes killed at least 19 people in central and south Gaza on Tuesday including two policemen who were helping protect humanitarian aid deliveries in the southern city of Rafah, Palestinian medics said.Seventeen of the deaths, they said, occurred in separate Israeli airstrikes on the al-Bureij and al-Maghazi refugee camps and the city of Deir-al-Balah in central Gaza, and by late Tuesday tanks were shelling an area just east of the al-Nusseirat camp, residents said.Some told Reuters via chat app that the renewed Israeli military push was sowing panic, with some families living in al-Maghazi starting to flee under tank fire, with four shells crashing near a clinic in the camp.In a brief statement issued earlier in the day, the Israeli military said jets were hitting Hamas militant targets in central Gaza while ground forces were operating “in a focused manner with guidance from intelligence” in the al-Bureij area.It gave no update on activity in Rafah, into which Israeli forces swept last month in what the military calls a limited operation to root out Hamas’ last intact combat units after almost eight months of devastating war in the Gaza Strip.The small city fringing Gaza’s southern border with Egypt had been sheltering about one million Palestinians who fled Israeli assaults in other parts of the enclave, but most have fled again in the face of Israel's tank-led advance.Israel launched an air and ground offensive in Gaza last October vowing to destroy Hamas after militants stormed across the border into southern Israel on October 7, killing around 1,200 people and taking more than 250 people hostage, according to Israeli tallies. About 120 hostages remain in Gaza.The Israeli military campaign has killed more than 36,000 people in densely populated Gaza, according to its health authorities, who say thousands more bodies are buried under rubble.Qatar said on Tuesday it had delivered an Israeli ceasefire proposal to Hamas that reflected a three-phase proposal presented on Friday by US President Joe Biden, and that the paper was now much closer to the positions of both sides.Qatar, which has been mediating on Gaza between Israel and Hamas, also stressed that there should be a clear position from both parties to clinch a deal, its foreign ministry spokesperson said in a press briefing.“The ceasefire deal should immediately end the long suffering of all people in Gaza and the hostages and their families and provide a roadmap for a permanent ceasefire and an end to the (humanitarian) crisis”, Majed al-Ansari said.However, a spokesman for Hamas, the Islamist militant group that has ruled Gaza since 2007, reiterated on Tuesday it could not agree to any deal unless Israel makes a “clear” commitment to a permanent truce and complete withdrawal from Gaza.For his part, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu repeated that there can be no permanent peace unless Hamas is eradicated, as he struggles with profound political divisions at home over the US-backed truce proposal.An aide to Netanyahu said on Sunday Israel had accepted the framework advanced by Biden, though he described it as flawed and in need of much more work.On Tuesday, his biggest coalition partner said it would support such a deal even if it entails an overhaul of the war strategy. But Netanyahu’s far-right allies in the government threatened to bolt and bring it down if he wound down the Gaza war without having annihilated Hamas.Biden’s framework proposal involves in its first stage a six-week ceasefire when Israeli forces would withdraw from “all populated areas” of Gaza and some hostages - including the elderly and women - would be freed by Hamas in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.Under that plan, Hamas and Israel would negotiate in the same phase a permanent ceasefire that Biden said would last “as long as Hamas lives up to its commitments.”In the second phase, Biden said there would be an exchange for all remaining living hostages, including male soldiers, Israeli forces would withdraw from Gaza and the permanent ceasefire would begin. The last stage of the plan would include the reconstruction of the shattered coastal enclave.Biden’s Middle East envoy, Brett McGurk, will travel to the region this week to push for a hostage deal and ceasefire, a US official told Reuters on Tuesday. \nThe collective indignity bestowed on political women, from Shailaja Acharya to Sumana Shrestha, by political patriarchs needs immediate redress. In today’s time, when power has ceased to be a zero-sum game and good leadership is synonymous with collaboration, the traditionally inclined old men clumsily spewing patriarchal narratives make civilised citizens extremely uncomfortable. Political women with independent political personhood have always been problematic to traditional men. Sahana’s grit, Shailaja’s impatience, Binda’s blatant feminism and Sumana’s formidability seem to have threatened those with the traditional bent of mind. At least two generations of strong, opinionated women have been sidelined or ousted because they did not fit into the mould of patriarchal party politics. It almost seems like the traditional men view them as political “shrews” who, like in the famous Shakespearean play The Taming of the Shrew, need to be “tamed”, cut to a size that is desirable to political patriarchy.Until not long ago, the concept of a “good woman” stemmed from feminine subservience and obedience. Women’s personhood was stunted through intense psychological conditioning that can be traced back to the origins of the state and society. A woman was told how her family’s honour rested on her good character. She was introduced to a heavy burden of feminine morality at an early age. With stories being fed about good women versus bad, patriarchy was very successful in grooming girls to grow up to be good women and obedient keepers of their family’s honour. Subservience was the prerequisite to being a good woman. A good woman was anything but defiant, and if by chance she did get tempted to disobey and defy the norms, she paid a hefty price. This “truth” was continuously fed into the feminine psyche, mostly through religious texts and scriptures. These women were duly punished in the ancient scriptures and medieval texts crafted and propagated by men.Vyaas wrote the story of how Draupadi was dragged by her hair and abused publicly because she had made fun of Duryodhana, leading to the great war between the Pandava and Kaurava brothers. Mother Mary was glorified as a virgin, while Mary Magdalene was vilified as a “loose” woman and had to be rescued. Sita’s disobedience tempted Ravana and caused much grief to Lord Ram. Eve disobeyed the Lord and ate the apple only to be the cause of Adam’s banishment. Khadija was a strong woman and a successful merchant before she married the Prophet, but she submitted herself to him and became his first disciple. In addition, the annual celebration of Swasthani Vrata Katha revered the ideal woman in the form of Goma Brahmani, who never protested, tolerated every injustice inflicted against her personhood. The idea of feminine morality has been strongly correlated with women’s socio-cultural subservience, religious conformity, psychological and economic fragility and physical docility. Even in politics, the men in charge prefer women who embody traditional femininity. However, here lies the problem: The idea of moral, subservient women clashes with the essence of equality and freedom propounded by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Women who have learned the freedoms cannot unlearn them. Today, several women in politics are highly qualified, independent, articulate and honest. They live the most painful existence because the unlearning of patriarchal values has already taken place within them, and they have a fully developed sense of personhood, which, however, is repeatedly obliterated by their party men or other political men who still operate by the patriarchal rules. Strong, independent, ethical women are repeatedly denied space in the party’s leadership. Educated, dignified, honest, resolute, independent and opinionated, Shailja Acharya was often ridiculed for her “short temper” and “moods”. In UML’s case, Sahana’s leadership in the inter-party women’s caucus irked her party men. An economist by training, she was more qualified than most men in her party, but her commitment to the larger political sorority was perceived as defiance; therefore, a covert “cutting to size” was practised against her as well. Narratives are created to invalidate women as viable leaders. These days, the “tamings” have become more overt. Binda Pandey, one of the handful of qualified women inside UML, was denied an election ticket, and the insider quickly pointed out that her “attitude” killed her prospects. The same has been the case with Shiva Maya Tumbahamphe, Kamala Panta, Shashi Shrestha, and others. Women’s recruitment, retention and promotions in parties seek obedient, subservient “yes-women” who do not have to be “tamed”. The latest “taming” attempt, however, appears much more menacing than the past. A woman with an ivy-league education, who speaks the global language, wears gender-neutral clothing, questions the old guards about procedural gaps, carries her own bags, drives her own car and has managed to keep herself out of the clout-centric politics so far, must irk the political retainers quite intensely to receive such blatant, overt attacks regarding her personal choices: From her clothing to her life partner. KP Oli has tried dismantling Sumana Shrestha’s political legitimacy and citizenship by calling Nepal her maita. The chauvinism that drips from Oli’s statement is disgustingly archaic, feudal and regressive for a leader of his stature.Bringing Shrestha into the helm of political give-and-take does not seem to have worked; if it had, Oli would not have had to start “taming” her. If she was unapologetically vocal as a member of the opposition, she seems adamant as a minister to fix the portfolio given to her. Maybe it is her “audacity” to fix the system at the ministry that has somehow miffed the old guard like Oli. His recent rants, aimed to paint her as a frivolous, westernised young woman whose political journey is a mere fluke, scream his intense insecurities. If that is indeed the case, then maybe Sumana Shrestha is doing something right, and we need more “shrew” muckrakers like her.  \nThe Upendra Yadav-led Janata Samajbadi Party-Nepal has continuously led the Madhesh government since the provincial governments were first set up following the 2017 elections.Over the past seven years, Yadav has always been on the governing side despite the many mergers and splits among Madhesh-based parties.The party’s Lalbabu Raut is the only chief minister (among the seven) who completed a full five-year term after 2017. After the general elections in November 2022, Saroj Kumar Yadav of the same party has been leading the Madhesh government. Though the Madhesh administration introduced a few good programmes, experts say, it failed to lead the government on many fronts. “As leaders and people from Madhesh were at the forefront of advocating for the federal system, they should have done more to strengthen the system,” Sohan Shah, a Madhesh expert, told the Post. “The party not only failed to strengthen federalism but also in good governance and other parameters.”He accused the Madheshi leaders of wasting more time bargaining with the centre instead of working to strengthen the federal system.Shah adds a fresh anecdote to explain why the JSP-Nepal-led government can be termed a failure in Madhesh.The federal government allocates the budget for provinces and the local level every year under the equalisation and special grants headers. As per the rule, the provincial Cabinet, in the case of the province, and local units, submit proposals to the National Planning Commission (NPC) with a demand for grants for projects. While all local units of Madhesh submitted their proposals, the provincial government failed to do so, Shah claimed.Except for the Madhesh Province, the NPC received over 3,600 proposals from across the country for fiscal equalisation and special grants for the upcoming fiscal year, to be incorporated in the national budget.“That was sheer negligence on the part of the Madhesh government,” an NPC official told the Post on the condition of anonymity. “We did not have such an experience where a provincial government did not apply for a significant amount of the national budget.”After leading Madhesh politics for more than a decade and a half, Upendra Yadav lost the 2022 general election to CK Raut in Saptari-2. It was a severe blow to the veteran leader to lose the race to a newbie. With the slogan of good and efficient governance and an anti-corruption campaign, Raut’s party won popular support in Madhesh. The new party secured 13 seats in the provincial assembly, becoming the fourth-largest party in Madhesh. Despite this the province's government was again led by JSP-Nepal, the third-largest party with 19 seats in the assembly. However, the JSP-Nepal’s strength further diminished after the Ashok Rai faction split the party on May 5 and launched the Janata Samata Party. Upendra Yadav has challenged the split, and the case is sub judice.Of the party’s total 12 members in the federal parliament, seven have joined the Rai-led party. The assembly members in Madhesh, however, didn’t join the new party as the party formation process was immediately challenged in the court.A newcomer in provincial and national politics, Janamat has been joining and quitting governments.“Janamat Party was prepared to remain in the opposition because the party wanted nothing less than government leadership. While the UML and the Maoist Centre have decided to form a new government in Madhesh, they cannot do it without Janamat’s support, and are left with no option but to accept Janamat's candidate for new chief minister,” said Shah.The CPN-UML is the largest party in the provincial assembly, with 25 seats, and the Congress, with 22 seats, is the second-largest. However, Upendra Yadav’s party has always led the provincial government.Experts say that major issues of Madhesh cannot be addressed in a true sense until the big political parties ignore them.Chandra Kishore, a Madhesh expert, also claims that the province got nothing substantive in the seven years of federal exercise. If the political parties other than JSP-Nepal lead the province, it could be in favour of the Madheshi people in many ways, Kishor said. “Madhesh does not belong to just one Madheshi party; it belongs to the other parties as well,” Chandra Kishore told the Post. “Parties other than JSP-Nepal vying to lead the Madhesh government means they also should own the agenda of Madhesh, which is a good thing.” Chandra Kishore added that if the new political parties lead the Madhesh Province, it could bring plurality in governance. As per the agreement reached between the three parties–CPN-UML, CPN (Maoist Centre), and Janamat Party—Raut’s Janamat is most likely to lead the next government in the province. “Raut’s party could challenge Yadav’s dominance in the province with an effective governance to establish him as a key political figure of Madhesh,” said Chandra Kishore. Incumbent chief minister, Saroj Kumar Yadav, lost the majority in the assembly after the UML and the Maoist Centre withdrew their support for the government. This has set the stage for a floor test on Wednesday.To claim the position in the 107-strong assembly, the chief minister needs the support of 54 members. Though the ruling partners claim that the Unified Socialist and the Loktantrik Samajbadi Party (LSP), in addition to Nagarik Unmukti and Nepal Sanghiya Samajbadi Party, will also support the government, the Unified Socialist and the LSP remain non-committal so far.On May 30, the UML, the Maoist Centre, and the Janamat Party agreed to support Mahesh Prasad Yadav, the Janamat parliamentary party leader, as the chief minister of the Province in a meeting held in Janakpur. On May 29, Congress chief Sher Bahadur Deuba invited Upendra Yadav, chair of Janata Samajbadi Nepal, Mahantha Thakur, chair of LSP, and Madhav Nepal, chair of the CPN (Unified Socialist), to his residence to discuss the political equation in Madhesh. During the meeting, three opposition parties including the Unified Socialist, a federal ruling partner, had agreed to uphold the JSP-Nepal’s leadership in Madhesh Province. However, Ratneshwar Goit of the Unified Socialist talking to the Post said, “Our party is discussing whom we should support to form the provincial government.”  \nThese days, I watch Nepali television news more frequently and read broadsheet papers and online news to observe the clash of dreams and reality, particularly in political events. The uncanny political developments in the country have propelled the speed of these events. Little worried by the indications of the erosion of the hard-earned democratic values and practices seen in political coalitions and the assault on media freedom, I briefly review the history of political leaders' dreams and failures in this column. I want to show that we, the people, bear the brunt of history’s tragic and farcical turns. An important shift has occurred in Nepali history from the tragic to the ludicrous. Karl Marx, in his famous work The Eighteenth Brumaire Of Louis Bonaparte, said, \"All the great events and characters of history occur twice, firstly as tragedy, secondly as farce.\" No communist leaders of Nepal appear to have referred to this book and Marx's prophetic statement except Baburam Bhattarai, the erstwhile Maoist leader and comrade of the current Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who has recently got the vote of confidence for the fourth time in 17 months. This is an interesting episode of political farce. Political parties and the cronies who are always proactive are reducing the democratic system established by people's sacrifice and dedication to a farce. That becomes clear if we watch the drama that happens in Parliament.There is a serious part to this historical shift. Marx also says, \"The social revolution of the nineteenth century cannot create its poetry from the past but only from the future”. This means that to draw strength and meaning from the past, you should create its poetry from the future. This is a little academic point. Repetition of historyThe Nepali democracy and those who have been given the responsibility to protect and use it precisely lack that vision of futurity; they do not perceive the poetry of the future. Their actions in parliament, narrow partisan behaviours, the reckless language they use, inadequate knowledge about the political dynamics of social change and the important time they squander away by acting irresponsibly all show that they lack the vision to create poetry from the future. I have begun to wonder whether the Nepali political parties will fully utilise the democratic political system to ameliorate the condition of the people of this land.The Nepali media fraternity says the sudden arrest of Kantipur Media Group Chairman Kailash Sirohiya on May 21, 2024, is unfair and \"motivated by personal vendetta.\" The agency in question is the coalition government led by Dahal and the Home Ministry. A certain revelation occurred to me after watching an interview with Bhattarai on Kantipur television on the same night. Bhattarai recalled one article he published in Kantipur in August 2001 about the royal massacre. I was mourning my mother's death in my village, Sabala of Terathum. I read that article to my elder brother and Nepali Congress district leader, Laya Prasad Subedi, who totally agreed with Bhattarai's analysis. The underground Maoist leader Bhattarai has said in that article the murders were the result of a \"political conspiracy\". Kailash Sirohiya and his co-publisher, Binod Raj Gyawali, and the editor-in-chief of Kantipur, Yubaraj Ghimire, were arrested for publishing that. Bhattarai said in the interview that he was stunned by the drama of Sirohiya's arrest, which shows an uncanny repetition of history. This time, he said, “Prachanda is in the position of the king, and the same media person is arrested, as the common opinion says, for publishing news stories about Prachanda's government.” Bhattarai also revealed that in a prime ministerial system like ours, no such decision is taken without the prime minister's consent. It is not the minister but the prime minister who can make such decisions, he explained.Whatever the position of parties and the leaders at the current moment of history, those who have followed the political history know that Bhattarai has always made decisions according to his understanding, conscience and interpretation of history. Bhattarai had declared that he was leaving the Maoist party because, metaphorically, it was not safe to live in the red-labelled house, which was a category of the badly damaged buildings after the earthquakes of 2015. I am dismayed by the performances of Pushpa Kamal Dahal. I am getting more and more disillusioned by his actions and those of the other communist leaders of different groups who are all in the coalition now. They include communist stalwarts like Dahal, KP Sharma Oli and Madhav Kumar Nepal. There is no point in talking about the behaviour of the individual ministers, whose sense of history and the missions often don't come to the fore. The coalition’s leader and a major actor Dahal is at the centre of the decisions in this system if we believe the interpretation of the former prime minister Bhattarai.It is challenging for all political leaders to maintain a history of their choice and to live up to the expectations of the people. Dahal is no exception. I want to recall one event here. Dahal had attended the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi in the third week of November 2006. Some people told me about him when I attended a literary conference in Delhi after that event. One professor, impressed with Dahal’s metamorphosis, gave me the news published in the paper. It cites Dahal saying, \"I have lived my life in jungle, now I will lead my life in light.\" Another report said, ''Nepal's firebrand Maoist leader Prachanda on Saturday said the political battle in the 21st century will be fought over democracy, which at present is in deep crisis.\" A euphoric Dahal, by his transformation, said while addressing the second session on the second day of the fourth Hindustan Times Leadership Summit in Delhi, \"Democracy will rule the world\". The report also said, \"The former Indian prime minister and admirer of Prachanda I. K. Gujaral says he had read about many epic stories about revolution and Prachanda has shown it by accomplishing an epic battle in Nepal.\"History says Dahal and other leaders have clearly failed to deliver. His and his various coalitions’ actions show that staying in power is their only goal. What has begun to worry nonpartisan academics and writers like us is that the power coalitions and groups only work with what Bertrand Russell calls the “lust for power.” The time has come for the free media, legal activists and civil society to be vigilant about protecting democracy.  \nEducation in Every Home’s report titled ‘Diversity, Equity and Inclusion in Nepal’s Textbooks’ highlights the lack of diversity, inclusivity, and inaccuracies in these textbooks.  The findings include egregious mistakes in textbooks like the inclusion of a letter Abraham Lincloln supposedly wrote—dating to a time 17 years after his assassination, to assertions like Brazil has tigers, elephants and rhinos while Germany has tigers and monkeys. The books display a clear bias in favour of Brahmin Chhetri males, while women make up just 18 percent of all people profiled. While 80 percent of all bylines are male, the presence of marginalised communities, especially Dalits, is nearly non-existent.  \n\nThe Araniko Project, which is also a popular blog, aims to uncover the past and present of the Nepal-China relations by using primary sources in Mandarin. A fluent Mandarin speaker, Rajbhandari, who has lived in Beijing for six years, has a master’s degree in Chinese politics from Renmin University of China.  In this conversation, she talks about Chinese historiography on Nepal, the nuances of Mandarin-to-English translation, Nepal-China ties and the importance of understanding Chinese language in order to understand the country. \nNeupane was one of the conveners of ‘Project Sambad’, “a collaborative platform hosted by a group of Nepali institutions, designed to promote in-depth conversations that critically examine Nepali society and its policy-making space.” The first edition of the event happened in Kathmandu on March 14 and 15.  In this interview, the two discuss the state of Nepali public debates and ways to foster better discussions on vital issues. \nPrime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal is gearing up for a Cabinet reshuffle, but the big question is whether he will replace the entire set of ministers from each coalition partner or just add a few new faces.To reorganise his Cabinet, the prime minister has already started consulting his alliance partners, specifically the CPN-UML Chairman KP Oli, the CPN (Unified Socialist) Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal, and others.According to Maoist Centre leaders, as soon as the process of forming a new government in Madhes province concludes, the prime minister will start the process of Cabinet reshuffle. Over the last couple of days, Dahal, Oli and Nepal have held several rounds of talks in order to give full shape to the provincial government in Sudurpaschim, to form a new government in Madhesh, and bring new parties like the Nagarik Unmukti and Janamat Party into the federal government.Once a new government is formed in Madhesh, the prime minister is likely to add some ministers from the Nagarik Unmukti Party and Janamat Party, said Mahesh Bartaula, chief whip of the UML. This has been the topic of discussion among the top leaders in the past few days, he said. “I don’t think the entire Cabinet will change,” he said.However, according to one Maoist Centre leader, the prime minister is in a difficult situation after the chairman of the CPN (Unified Socialist) Nepal sought a package deal on power-sharing.Jagannath Khatiwada, spokesperson of the Unified Socialist said his party has communicated its demands clearly to both Dahal and Oli.“During recent meetings with the prime minister and the UML chief, our chairman made it clear that we need an additional minister in the federal government, a fair share in Koshi, Madhesh and Karnali governments, and participation of the UML and Maoist Centre in the Sudurpaschim government before the formation of the government in Koshi,” he said.Dirgha Bahadur Sodari of the Unified Socialist is the chief minister in Sudurpaschim, but the delay by the UML and Maoist Centre in joining the government has caused frustration within the Unified Socialist.In order to extend support for forming a new government in the Madhesh province, which will probably be led by the Janamat Party, the Unified Socialist party has withdrawn its two ministers from the current Saroj Kumar Yadav government. Yadav is the chief minister of the Madhesh province and represents the Janata Samajbadi Party Nepal.A section of the Maoist Centre has been calling for the replacement of the entire set of ministers in the Dahal Cabinet. But the UML, the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Unified Socialist are against doing so. “Some of our ministers have been serving since December 2022, so some leaders in the party want to replace them with new faces,” a central committee member of the Maoist Centre said. With the exception of Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun, there is a call within the party to replace all the ministers, the leader said, adding that “this agenda will likely be discussed during the upcoming meeting of the party.” Besides the prime minister, the CPN (Maoist Centre) has one deputy prime minister, and four ministers in the Cabinet.“There are several issues, but nothing has been discussed,” said Govinda Acharya, press adviser to the Prime Minister Dahal. “First, ministers from the Janamat Party and the Nagarik Unmukti Party are likely to join the Cabinet as per the understanding among party leaders.”“Our position is clear,” said Khatiwada, the Unified Socialist spokesperson. “We want a package deal, which we have clearly communicated both to prime minister Dahal and UML chair Oli.”“From the centre to the provincial level as well as in other major political appointments, we need a fair share,” said Khatiwada. He complained that the prime minister and the UML chief assured several times in the past to address the grievances of the Unified Socialist, but the promise has not been kept. To show his frustration, party chief Nepal participated in a meeting of the opposition parties a few days ago.“We have decided to help the federal coalition install a new government in the Madhesh province. So we need a fair share in provincial governments in Madhesh, Koshi, Karnali and Sudurpaschim. Cabinet reshuffle is solely the prime minister’s prerogative and he might be feeling pressure from within his own party. He may replace his party’s ministers, but this has not been discussed in the meetings of alliance members,” Khatiwada told the Post. \nKP Sharma Oli, the chairman of the major ruling partner CPN-UML, has accused Finance Minister Barsha Man Pun of failing to orient the government’s annual budget towards socialism as per the spirit of the constitution.Addressing a UML parliamentary party meeting on Saturday, Oli pointed out the shortcomings in the budget preparation process and criticised the finance minister for not consulting the UML during its preparation.The remarks by the chief of the largest party in the ruling coalition come as Parliament prepares to start deliberations on the budget, which Pun presented on May 28.“What is the theoretical orientation of the budget, and where do we intend to go?” Oli asked the government led by CPN (Maoist Centre) Chairman Pushpa Kamal Dahal at the party meeting. “All these things should be discussed during deliberations in Parliament,” Oli said, instructing the party’s lawmakers as the parliamentary party leader. The government did not increase allocation for social security schemes in the budget presented last week, and it did not introduce any new programmes for social security. “If Oli read the inability to spend more on social security as the government’s failure to orient the budget along the constitutional goal of socialism, he is mistaken,” said a finance ministry official on condition of anonymity. “We are facing resource constraints to set aside more funds for such distributive programmes.”“Socialism is a buzzword among communist parties. To be pragmatic, however, the funds available are not enough to introduce a socialism-oriented budget,” the officer told the Post.Nepal’s new constitution, promulgated in 2015, envisions Nepal as a socialism-oriented country. Nonetheless, the private sector has been given control over all important facets of the public and economic spheres.The Nepali Congress champions liberalisation and privatisation, but the party's guiding principle is democratic socialism. Other political parties, including the UML and other communist forces, follow a similar path. Though the constitution mentions Nepal as a socialism-oriented democracy, the charter does not define socialism. Even Parliament has not considered the matter a topic of discussion. “There is a lot of confusion over what socialism actually means in our context,” Surendra Pandey, a former finance minister and vice-chair of the UML, told the Post.Nepal’s political parties should compete in a production-oriented economy rather than a distributive one, Pandey suggested. “If we only focus on distribution-oriented fiscal policies, our economy will eventually stagnate.”A look at world history shows that revolution and evolution are the two bases to achieve socialism, Pandey said. “After their revolutions, countries like France and China nationalised the properties of the erstwhile rulers and distributed them to the public apart from enacting other reforms in order to achieve socialism.”In Nepal, “we need to abide by evolution-based reforms to attain socialism,” Pandey said. Many European countries follow this model. Incomes and properties of the rich are taxed to raise funds for social-security programmes, he added. “However, if we are looking for a distribution-oriented scheme for political gains, then it won’t yield significant results in the long run.”Economists also believe that a socialism-oriented budget is unrealistic during a time of economic hardship. They say the budgets presented even by the erstwhile Oli-led governments were far from socialism-oriented.Oli became prime minister two times: once after the promulgation of the constitution in 2015 and again after the first election held under the same constitution in 2017. The governments he led presented at least three budgets. “Apart from running some fair-price shops or selling some goats and sheep on the occasion of Dashain-Tihar, no government in Nepal has taken any concrete steps to build a socialist-oriented community as mentioned in the constitution,” Dipendra Bahadur Chhetri, a former governor of the Nepal Rastra Bank, told the Post. “This was also true of the previous Oli-led governments.” Chhetri said that the budget for the next fiscal year is conservative. “The communist-led government is always criticised for its distribution-oriented budget, which comes to galvanise its populist agenda,” added Chhetri. “But it’s an illusion to believe that a distribution-oriented budget with a focus on social security schemes is the way towards socialism.”Oli on Saturday instructed his party’s lawmakers to freely criticise the government if they find any instances of budget allocation in breach of the principle. “As a ruling party, we support this budget and will help with its implementation,” Oli said. “However, this does not mean that we should not point out deficiencies in the budget.”Addressing the parliamentary party meeting, Oli expressed his displeasure at lack of consultations among the ruling partners. He also raised the question of whether the budget was prepared by the finance minister himself or by the Maoist party he represents.“The budget could have been much better if the finance minister had engaged in more extensive consultation with the coalition partners,” Oli said.President Ramchandra Paudel presented the government’s policies and programmes in Parliament on May 14. In principle, the finance minister prepares the annual budget based on the policies and programmes and the feedback given by lawmakers during the deliberations on the policies and programmes.However, the policies and programmes could not be discussed in Parliament this time owing to its prolonged obstruction by the main opposition Congress demanding a parliamentary probe in the cooperatives fraud. \nIt took several House obstructions and rounds of negotiations and meetings to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the misuse of public funds by various cooperatives.Not only were the parliamentary proceedings paralysed, but the entire national politics was focussed on the dispute over the formation of the probe committee until it was constituted on Tuesday. But now that the committee is in place, when it will start the investigation is still unsure. And no parties, including those on whose demand the panel was formed, have shown any urgency to start the probe.Following an agreement among the major parties, the House of Representatives on Tuesday formed a seven-member committee headed by CPN-UML lawmaker Surya Thapa.Its other members are Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Nepali Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party.The committee members say they are not sure when the investigation will begin. Neupane said the committee has not even held its first meeting.It is the chairperson’s responsibility to call the meeting, Neupane said. “We may have to remind him to call the meeting if he continues to delay it.”Thapa said he has requested the Speaker and the Parliament Secretariat to arrange the office and personnel for the committee. “I am currently in my constituency in Pyuthan. We will get down to business once we get our office and staff,\" he told the Post.Other members of the committee, however, say that though the office setup is necessary to start the investigation, holding a meeting and carrying out preparatory work was possible without it. The panel must prepare its working procedure within the framework finalised by the committee led by Padam Giri, minister for law, justice and parliamentary affairs.The Giri-led panel had agreed on four terms of reference (ToR) for the probe committee.As per the ToR, the committee will investigate cooperatives facing crisis, their legal and institutional purposes, financial systems, regulations, supervision, and transparency, and make recommendations to the government.Another task is to recommend measures for the immediate return of savings to the depositors of the crisis-ridden cooperatives identified by the Department of Cooperatives and the Crisis-ridden Cooperatives Management Committee. The parliamentary panel has also been mandated to study and analyse the progress of the savings protection and return by the crisis-ridden cooperatives.The Department of Cooperatives has listed 20 cooperatives as crisis-ridden, with billions of depositors’ money at risk.Another task the Thapa-led committee needs to accomplish is tracking the condition of funds from problematic cooperatives. The funds include those allegedly transferred to the Gorkha Media Network which operated the now-shuttered Galaxy 4K television once managed by Rabi Lamichhane, who is the deputy prime minister and home minister in the coalition government, and other companies and organisations. It will also probe the legality of such transfers, investigate anyone involved in the illegal transfer of funds, and make recommendations to recover the funds.According to police investigations, billions of rupees from several cooperatives were transferred to the GB Rai-led Gorkha Media Network. He has fled the country, and Interpol has issued a diffusion notice against him.The committee is tasked with investigating credit cooperatives whose deposits were transferred to run the Gorkha Media Network and other organisations. Ideal Yamuna Multipurpose Cooperative, Image Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sahara Saving and Cooperative, Samanata Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sano Paila Saving and Credit Cooperative, Supreme Saving and Credit Cooperative, Suryadarshan Saving and Credit Cooperative, Sumeru Saving and Credit Cooperative, and Swarnalaxmi Saving and Credit Cooperative are the ones that injected money into the Gorkha Media Network. It took weeks for the parties to agree on the ToR as they were sharply divided on whether to name Lamichhane, who has been accused of illegally channelling money from three cooperatives to the media company he jointly led with Rai. The Congress agreed not to name Lamichhane after all the cooperatives linked with the Gorkha Media Network were subjected to probe.“Our committee has big tasks to accomplish, but the chairperson is not showing any urgency,” said a committee member. The Thapa-led panel has three months to complete its job. \nA standoff between Road Division, Kathmandu, and Kathmandu Metropolitan City at New Road ended without any untoward incident on Monday after the federal government deployed a massive police force.The city police, deployed in huge numbers to stop the division’s workers from repairing the road section between New Road gate and Juddha Salik destroyed by the metropolis, were backed off after federal police intervened.“We are committed to executing an order of the metropolis to expand pedestrian lanes in the New Road area,” said Raju Nath Pandey, chief of City Police. “We backed off, as we cannot scuffle with the federal police force. Everybody knows who deployed the federal police and what their intention is. There are hundreds of places in Kathmandu where road conditions are not good, but the Road Division has hurried to fix the parts we cut for expansion of the sidewalks.”The dispute between the two agencies—Road Division and Kathmandu metropolis—over expanding pedestrian lanes and not letting cutting road sections spiraled into Monday’s standoff.Some ten days ago, the metropolis cut 1.5 metres on both sides of roads in New Road to expand footpaths.The division intervened and stopped the metropolis workers from cutting the roads, saying that the road section comes under its jurisdiction and that the city office has not taken approval for the footpath expansion.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed officials to dump truckloads of dirt and trash in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office, blaming the agencies for delayed road expansion work from Kalanki to Maharajgunj which had caused problems for the public.Taking to social media, Kathmandu Mayor Shah blamed Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport Raghubir Mahaseth for not expediting the road expansion.“If your direct order can stop an ongoing project, it can also complete the work,” Shah said.“For the past 15 years, the citizens of Kathmandu have had to breathe in dusty air and face hardships in the name of Ring Road expansion,” reads Shah’s status posted on social media.Mayor Shah also sarcastically warned that the KMC would send a truckload of dust as a gift to Minister Mahaseth every day until the work along the Ring Road section is expedited.“It does not look good for only the public to suffer. I will continue to send a truckload of dust to you as a ‘gift’ every day until the work is resumed. Please accept it as love,” Shah wrote.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years.The Road Division, which picked up the dust and garbage dumped by the metropolis on its own, criticised the metropolis for its act.“The behaviour of the largest and responsible local government of the country mocks the rule of law, and this kind of behaviour in a violent and chaotic manner will never enhance the dignity of the metropolis,” reads the statement issued by the division.The division later issued an ultimatum to the KMC, asking it to fix the damaged parts of the roads within two days.When the metropolis ignored the ultimatum, the division itself repaired the damaged parts taking the help of federal police forces.“The metropolis dug up the roads without taking approval from our office. Instead of seeking approval, it gave us notice about its decision,” said Pramod Khatiwada, information officer at the division. “As the monsoon is about to start and the New Road area is one of the busiest road sections, it was our responsibility to repair it.”When asked if metropolis officials are committed to expanding the pavements, Khatiwada said that he hoped concerned officials would “come to their senses” and sort out the disputes, obtaining approval from concerned agencies.“They should first hold discussions with officials and higher agencies and convince them why they need to expand the footpath and take over the road section from us,” said Khatiwada. “We hope that the city office will not repeat the same mistake again and again.”Metropolis officials said that footpaths in new road areas, which always remain busy and packed, should be widened enough so that pedestrians can move freely. Officials claimed that locals from the New Road area have also requested the city office for the expansion.“Locals have also complained about insecurity and sexual harassment in walking on the footpath,” said Sunita Maharjan, elected ward member of Ward 24 of the metropolis. “Locals from our ward have no objection to the expansion of the footpath. The metropolis has started expansion works in demand of the public.”Sobha Malakar, a local from the Indrachowk area, said that it is very difficult to walk on the narrow pavement in the New Road area. Most of the locals of Ward 24 demanded the expansion of the footpaths with the city office. “It is very difficult to walk freely on the footpath in the New Road area,” said Malakar. “Walking on the footpath is very suffocating in the area. Women and girls walk on the road risking collision with vehicles.”Some people supported the Road Division's moves to prevent the city office from expanding the footpath on Monday. Locals of Ward 24 said that those not seeking pavement expansion are from other wards who fear that the already narrowed roads in their area would be further narrowed.“Those who had protested for parking in New Road have been protesting against the expansion of the footpath,” reads Mayor Shah’s status posted on social media.He asked the public to consider how the road will be narrowed for driving when a sidewalk is made only of parts that were used for parking in the past. \nThe Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority on Monday filed a graft case at the Special Court against 14 individuals, including Gajendra Maharjan, the mayor of Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur.The case has been filed against them, charging them with causing a revenue loss of Rs1.04 billion to the state coffers while approving tenders for the extraction of sand and stones from the fiscal year 2018-19 to 2022-23.The CIAA has named Maharjan, the then administrative officer, along with other people’s representatives and contractors, as defendants in the case. Information Officer at the Special Court, Yagya Raj Regmi, said the CIAA had filed the case on the charge of causing revenue loss by awarding contracts at rates lower than those fixed by the government.Maharjan, who was elected mayor from the Nepali Congress, is serving his second term as the municipal chief. \nMany countries worldwide have started using smart systems, including artificial intelligence, to manage chaotic traffic. Nepal, however, has chosen to deploy traffic rule violators as traffic rule keepers.What concerns legal experts, former law enforcement officials, and the chair of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of House of Representatives is the individual whim and fantasy of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Home Affairs Ravi Lamichhane, who issued a direction under agencies concerned under his ministry to enforce the decision to deploy rule violators on the road for traffic management.“Stop ruling people at an individual whim. This is neither Rana nor Shah regime or military rule,” said Ramhari Khatiwada, chairman of the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of the House. “Home minister should stop humiliating people, and he too is not above the law.”Khatiwada said that he had sought time with Home Minister Lamichhane to discuss the issue on Friday but he did not give him time. He said that the government should formulate a law first and bring regulations if it thinks deploying rule violators for traffic management is necessary.The Metropolitan Traffic Police Division of Kathmandu said that it had deployed 1,302 people who were booked for traffic rules violations, including drunk driving, on Wednesday.“We are only implementing the instructions of the higher agency,” said Jeevan Kumar Shrestha, the division’s spokesperson. “We provided basic instructions to the rule violators and deployed them on streets for traffic management.”When asked if rules violators would help traffic police manage Kathmandu’s traffic, Shrestha said that even the traffic police, who received one to one-and-a-half years of training, sometimes could not handle the traffic chaos.Former senior officials at Nepal Police also questioned the intention of the home minister to force traffic rule violators to stay on the roads. They say that existing law doesn't support the home minister’s decision, and it also jeopardises the safety of those being deployed on the streets.“The decision to deploy rule violators is against the will of the people, which is against the provision that the state will not force anyone to serve against their will,” said Hemanta Malla, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police. “This decision can be challenged in court.”Managing traffic is an expert’s job. Traffic police, who have worked for years in Valley's traffic management, also sometimes find the job challenging. Legal experts said that the home minister should bring law and regulation first if he thinks the valley's traffic would be better managed by forcing rule violators to stay on the roads.“The decision is against the principle of the rule of law. People cannot be forced to follow the home minister’s irrational directions,” said Raju Chapagain, a constitutional lawyer. “Respective committee of the House, National Human Rights Commission and other concerned agencies should take note of this decision and direct the concerned agencies to stop ruling people at individual whims.” \n\nPrime Minister Dahal triggered the breakthrough of the headrace tunnel of the 900 MW Arun III Hydroelectric Project in Nepal, marking a crucial step in the India-funded project aimed at boosting Nepal's energy capacity and facilitating electricity exports.\nVidushi Rana appointed Honorary Consul of Iceland in Nepal, inaugurating the new Consulate and fostering bilateral relations between the nations.\nDairy farmers face unpaid dues with protests planned due to dairy companies breaching an agreement with government to settle farmers' outstanding dues, despite rising liabilities caused by low dairy demand and state-owned dairies seeking a bailout fund.\nPolio vaccination campaigns in Nepal's Tarai region are disrupted by extreme heat, causing delays in immunizing over 1.46 million children against Type-2 polio while the country remains polio-free since 2010.\nThe 16th five-year periodic plan, proposed by the National Planning Commission, aims to reduce neonatal deaths to 13 from the existing 21 in every 1,000 live births. Public health experts, however, are sceptical of its success, as neonatal deaths have not declined since 2016, and the measures taken at present are not sufficient to lessen the ongoing death rates.“Both the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022 and the finance ministry’s recent report show neonatal deaths constantly high,” said Dr Shyam Raj Upreti, former director general at the Department of Health Services. “It will not be easy to pick high-hanging fruits. It requires a lot of investments and micro planning, which are currently lacking.”A recent report by the Ministry of Finance shows that 21 neonates die in every 1,000 live births, the same results shown by the Nepal Demographic and Health Survey-2022, carried out by the Ministry of Health and Population.The government’s target for Sustainable Development Goals is to reduce neonatal mortality to 12 deaths per every 1,000 live births by 2030.The SDGs, a follow-up on the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), aim to end poverty, hunger, and all forms of inequality in the world by 2030. Nepal has committed to meeting the goals.The 16th five-year plan, which starts next fiscal year and ends in 2029, is aligned with the SDG targets.Public health experts say meeting the goal is easier said than done. Most health facilities having birthing centres lack neonatal units, trained human resources, and quality services.“Without ensuring quality services, which require trained human resources and advanced facilities, among others, it is impossible to reduce neonatal deaths,” said Upreti. “The government has made various plans to reduce child deaths—including neonatal deaths—but does not pay much attention to their effective implementation.”The finance ministry’s recent report shows that the institutional delivery rate increased to 80 percent from 79 percent last year. The rise in institutional deliveries has contributed to lessening the maternal mortality rate, which is 151 in every 100,000 live births.“Fifty percent of the neonates die in the first 24 hours of birth,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division of the Department of Health Services. “Most of our health facilities, including birthing centres, lack proper infrastructures.”Study shows that 85 percent of all deaths among children under the age of five in Nepal take place before a child’s first birthday, with 64 percent occurring during the first month of life.Along with trained human resources, infrastructures and quality services, deaths of neonates are also linked to the antenatal care visit of pregnant women, access to health facilities, timely referral system and others, experts say. The government has been taking various measures to reduce neonatal deaths, including planning to set up a ‘special newborn care unit’ in all district hospitals throughout the country. For that, concerned agencies under the health ministry have imparted training to all doctors, nurses and paramedics serving in Nuwakot, Dhading, Sindhupalchok and Makawanpur district hospitals.Special newborn care units are general units designed to care for newborn children who fall ill shortly after birth. Doctors, nurses, and paramedics monitor ailing children admitted to the unit.The health ministry has installed an underfloor heating system at birthing centres in four mountain districts to curb postpartum and neonatal deaths there.Underfloor heating is a form of central heating that ensures indoor climate control for thermal comfort. It uses an electrical heating cable installed underneath the flooring.Hypothermia, infection, low birth weight, premature birth, and abnormal birth asphyxia are among the leading causes of neonatal deaths, doctors say.Some of the programmes being undertaken to lower child mortality include newborn care, kangaroo care, exclusive breastfeeding, infection prevention, chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care, and free neonatal care. “Whatever the achievements we made so far were achieved by the measures taken as of now,” said Upreti. “The ongoing programme may not achieve further progress. Government must implement the programmes and plans to prevent more deaths.” \nThe government has allocated Rs86.24 billion to the health sector for the upcoming fiscal year, around a 2.5 percent increase from the 83.99 billion allocated for the current fiscal year.The new allocation is only around 4.6 percent of the total budget.Funds have been allocated to give continuity to most of the ongoing programmes—safe motherhood programmes, free essential medicines, setting up basic health care centres in all wards throughout the country, and financial relief to people from difficult and expensive diseases—cardiovascular disease, cancer, renal failure, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, head and spinal injury, sickle cell anaemia, and stroke. The health budget also includes grants to Tribhuvan University Teaching Hospital, Nepal Police Hospital, Nepal Army Hospital, Civil Hospital, and others. The national budget has announced a few new programmes, including the establishment of the Sita Dahal Memorial College of Naturopathy and Yogic Science under Kathmandu University. Sita Dahal is the late wife of Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal, who died in July last year. Health experts said that the incumbent government neglected the health sector this year, too, as a slight increase in the annual budget does not help to continue the existing health programme.“How can we achieve the Sustainable Development Goals targets from the budget allocated to the health care sectors?” said Mahendra Prasad Shrestha, former chief specialist at the Ministry of Health and Population. “We need to bring qualitative change, and for that, huge investments are required.”Several healthcare programmes, including safe motherhood programmes, child health programmes, tuberculosis control, nutrition, vector control programmes, epidemic control, non-communicable diseases, and mental health programmes, have already been affected by the cut in the previous year’s budget.Likewise, the budget doesn't address the growing burden of non-communicable diseases.Non-communicable diseases—such as heart disease, stroke, cancer, diabetes, and chronic lung disease—have emerged as major public health problems of late, accounting for 71 percent of deaths in the country.A 2019 study by the Nepal Health Research Council on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases, which primarily focused on behavioural risk factors—tobacco and alcohol consumption, biological risk factors, raised blood pressure, overweight, obesity, abnormal lipid prevalence, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes—found non-communicable diseases have emerged as a major killer.Nepal has witnessed several outbreaks in recent years—dengue, cholera diarrheal diseases, and other vector-borne diseases. The country has failed to achieve the malaria elimination target.“Every hour, one person commits suicide, the burden of non-communicable diseases has increased alarmingly, and neonatal deaths have not declined in the past several years,” said Shrestha. “Several programmes of health, including a free screening of cervical cancer and renal problems in the state-run health facilities, could not be implemented due to various reasons. The budget allocated for health even does not support continuing the ongoing programmes.”Experts caution that budgetary cuts in crucial healthcare programmes would have a long-term impact and could affect the achievements made over the years.“The government has not allocated the health budget to strengthen the federal structures,” said Dr Padam Bahadur Chand, former chief of the Policy Planning and International Cooperation Division at the Ministry of Health. “Most of the health budget will be spent on the salaries of the staffers.” \nNepal confirms the spread of Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4, offshoots of the Omicron variant responsible for the recent surge.\nHealth authorities have failed to locate the whereabouts of over 1,500 girls who were jabbed with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine once but did not show up for a second dose.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population said that health agencies in all seven provinces have been making phone calls and requesting them to come for a second dose of the vaccine.“Hundreds of girls aged between 14 and 15 years did not show up for the second dose of HPV vaccine, as they were preparing for secondary education examinations (SEE),” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services. “After they completed the exam, some returned to their homes and others to cities for further studies.”The health ministry’s data shows 9,980 girls between 14 and 15 years of age from the seven provinces were jabbed with the first dose of the HPV vaccine in a pilot programme launched in September last year. Those who were administered the first dose were supposed to take the second dose of vaccine in six months.Health authorities first launched the second dose vaccination in federal hospitals in all the provinces, but due to a low uptake, they sent vaccinators to schools. The vaccination programme was suspended later after vaccinators failed to track the girls who were administered the first dose.Officials hoped that girls would seek a second dose of the vaccine after completing the SEE examination, but that too did not happen.Human papillomavirus is a viral infection that spreads through skin contact. The virus causes cervical cancer, which is the second most common cancer in the developing world and a major cause of death among Nepali women. Hundreds of women get diagnosed with cervical cancer every year in Nepal.According to the BP Koirala Memorial Cancer Hospital in Bharatpur, more than 700 women suffering from cervical cancer seek treatment at the hospital every year.Doctors say most cervical cancer cases are associated with HPV, a sexually transmitted infection and that widespread immunisation could reduce the impact of cervical and other cancers caused by the HPV worldwide.Countries like Bhutan, Sri Lanka, Thailand and the Maldives have introduced the HPV vaccine nationally, while India and Indonesia have introduced it in some districts.In 2016, Nepal piloted HPV vaccination in Chitwan and Kaski districts. All girls aged between 11 and 13 years were then given two doses of the vaccine.Experts say early treatment prevents up to 80 percent of cervical cancer.HPV vaccination was also included in the government’s policies and programmes for the next fiscal year 2024-25, which is a repetition of the past several years. Health ministry officials, who used to claim that HPV vaccination would be available to all eligible girls in 2022, said a nationwide HPV vaccination drive is likely in 2025 only.The ministry plans to inoculate around 1.7 million girls between 10 and 14 years with the HPV vaccine through nationwide drives and also make it part of regular immunisation.According to officials, the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI) has agreed to provide HPV vaccine doses. Once the campaign is completed, the vaccine will be included in the government’s routine immunisation programme.Nepal submitted a proposal to GAVI in July last year requesting free HPV doses so that the vaccine could be included on the regular immunisation list. Ministry officials say they have proposed a budget for nationwide HPV vaccination campaigns in 2025.Officials say that GAVI has already agreed to provide required vaccine doses, but the problem is their availability. The World Health Organisation says HPV vaccination is recommended as part of a coordinated strategy to prevent cervical cancer and other diseases caused by the virus.The UN health body says HPV is responsible for more than 70 percent of cervical cancer cases in women. Countries that have included the HPV vaccine in their regular immunisation list have successfully reduced cervical cancer cases in women, according to doctors. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nChicken eggs are a healthy, nutritious superfood, containing most of the minerals and vitamins a body needs. They are relatively cheap as well. They are a complete source of protein, credited with a reduction in malnutrition in children and pregnant women in recent years in Nepal.According to nutritionists, consuming eggs daily has multiple benefits including weight loss, reduced blood pressure and protection against infections.Sourcing of our eggs Nepal is self-reliant on chicken eggs. According to the Nepal Egg Producers Association, poultry farmers in the country produce 3.1 million eggs a day.“Our production is sufficient to meet domestic demand,” said Shiva Ram KC, chairman of the association.Sizes and types Eggs are mostly available in two sizes—big and medium. Big-sized eggs cost Rs450 a crate (30 eggs) while medium-sized ones cost Rs435 a crate. Pastured eggs or eggs from local chickens are also available but they cost more than double the price of eggs produced in poultry farms. These are called Omega-3-enriched eggs, which are more nutritious than those produced on farms. Nutritionists say such eggs contain higher amounts of Omega-3 fat and are high in vitamins A and E. Omega-3 fatty acids are also known to reduce blood levels of triglycerides, a well-known risk factor for heart disease. As pastured eggs are scarce, one has to directly contact farmers to buy them. Officials at the Department of Food Technology said that generally, pastured eggs are not produced in bulk, but they may be made available through some trusted suppliers. Why have them, and how many? As chicken eggs are rich in protein, most minerals and vitamins, there are multiple reasons to take them. A whole egg contains Vitamin A, Vitamin B9, Vitamin B5, Vitamin B 12, Vitamin B 2, Vitamin D, E, B6, minerals—phosphorus, selenium, calcium and zinc.“A healthy adult can eat 1–2 eggs a day without hesitation,” said Dr Atul Upadhyay, a nutritionist. “A whole egg contains almost all the nutrients a body needs.”What about the quality of eggs? No agency in the country is checking the quality of the eggs being sent to the market. The issue of excessive use of antibiotics in chicken is often raised but no one talks about the presence of antibiotic residue in eggs.Studies in other countries including India show high levels of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in chickens raised for meat and eggs.The Department of Food Technology and Quality Control examines the quality of processed foods containing eggs but does not check the quality of eggs per se. Experts say there is no mechanism in the country to ascertain the quality of eggs. It is also difficult to determine the quality of eggs by merely looking at them, for instance whether they have thick or thin shells.Other benefits Eggs help in weight loss and strengthening prenatal bone. They increase mental energy. The lutein in the eggs enhances skin’s moisture and the protein helps tighten the skin. Egg yolk boosts skin complexion, as they are high in fatty acids, nutritionists say.Daily consumption of eggs might lower the risk of stroke. Antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin contained in eggs help prevent eye diseases like cataracts and age-related muscle degeneration. Choline in eggs is important for pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers, as it helps with baby’s brain development. \nLocated in Bakhundole, Lalitpur, Piano Piano South stands as a serene oasis offering a delightful escape from the city’s hustle and bustle.

It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nThe gate leading inside the city of Lucknow proudly declares, “Muskuraiye aap Lucknow mein hain” (Smile because you are in Lucknow). During my brief stay, the city lived upto its promise. Known as the city of Nawabs, with a rich history going centuries back, the city is abuzz with autos, rickshaws, honks of public buses and the constant loud sounds of the metro going over your head, irritable honks of public buses and food that leaves you wanting more.In such a happening place stands Bara Imambara, built in 1784 by Asaf-ud-Daula. ‘Bara’ means big, and ‘Imambara’ is a building with a big hall where people assemble for mourning congregations. This building was originally built to provide employment for the public because, at that period, the country was going through a famine, and it was seen as a relief project. I walked through the grand entrance gate known as Rumi Darwaza (Turkish Gate), wiping my sweat and fighting the Lucknow heat, entering the vast complex. Echoing in all corners was a voice from the speaker that kept reminding the visitors of the many rules inside the historical place. I tried not to let the wonder overwhelm me as I walked through the complex. To my right stood the elegant Asafi Mosque, recently painted in cream-like white. Its design is visually pleasing and a testament to the Mughal era’s artistic finesse. Its walls are adorned with intricate calligraphy and elegant designs, reminiscent of a time when such aesthetics held great importance. I couldn’t help but admire the tremendous effort the craftsmen put into bringing the Nawab’s vision to life, meticulously crafting the elegant domes which seemed to touch the sky. The mosque’s serene atmosphere stands in stark contrast to the bustling city just beyond its walls.Upon stepping into the main hall—known as Asafi Hall—I was immediately struck by its sheer size. It is vast and impressive, appearing to stretch into eternity, and its massive arched roof seemed to defy gravity. What’s even more intriguing is that it stands without the support of pillars or beams. The interlocking system of bricks, a hidden secret, upholds this colossal structure, leaving one in awe of the brilliance of the builders of the past.This very hall houses a large vaulted central chamber with the tomb of Asaf-ud-Daula. Standing beside his tomb was a chilling moment, knowing that the remains of a great historical figure was resting just a few feet below. After scanning the large hall, the guide took me to my favourite part of the Imambara—the labyrinth or the Bhool Bhulaiyaa. This labyrinth sits right above the main hall, and because the hall is unsupported, the ceiling had to be lightweight, so the hollow labyrinth was born. It is quite impossible to figure out the Bhool Bhulaiyaa on your own, as it is a confusing network of corridors and staircases. So, it is necessary to have the company and guidance of a guide.As I moved with my guide through the maze, I thought I could feel the presence of the past inhabitants who had walked through these confusing passageways. What fascinated me most was the maze’s design: every sound, no matter how faint, echoed through the structure, enhancing its aura of mystery.The guide whispered from a distance, his head close to the wall, and the sound reached my ears, even though he was out of sight. It felt as if the walls carried the whispers. We exchanged astonished glances. When the guide reappeared, he smiled and remarked, “Now, you understand why they say that walls have ears.”Exiting the maze, I climbed to the roof, which offered a breathtaking view of Lucknow. The city spread out in front of me, its modern skyline contrasting the monument’s historic charm. It was a moment of reflection, contemplating how centuries had passed, and yet, Bara Imambara stood as a timeless witness to the changing tides of history. As I stood there, taking it all in, I felt recharged by the air coming in from all directions. After descending from the terrace, my brisk guide led me to the final stop in the Imambara, Shahi Baoli (Stepwell). Also referred to as the royal stepwell, it sits underground and is another example of architectural brilliance in the complex. This didn’t surprise me much since it was built at a time when architecture wasn’t just functional but also a work of art.The moment I descended the steps that led me underground, I noticed the sudden drop in temperature. The Shahi Baoli served as a cool refuge during the blistering summer day. The well-planned architecture of the Baoli allowed it to naturally regulate its temperature. The way to the main well is locked, but visitors can throw coins through jail-like doors into the well in order to try out their luck, much like we do in Davis Falls in Pokhara.Entering the underground corridors, I felt a slight chill because it was cold and dimly lit. I turned on my phone’s flashlight and saw the walls adorned with intricate Mughal carvings. Upon reaching a spot where we could see the well, the guide informed us that the well acted as a CCTV camera at the time. He explained that individuals inside the structure could discreetly observe those entering, as their reflections would be visible on the well’s water, but the people entering could not see the people inside the building.I waited to see that happen, and when a group entered through the gate, I was stunned; their faces were perfectly mirrored on the water’s surface, showcasing the ingenuity behind the well’s design, serving both as a water source and a security measure.My experience at Bara Imambara was a delightful one. I had never seen such a remarkable work of architecture before—it is beautiful, interesting and ahead of its time. \nSerene, snow-capped mountains set against the bluest skies. It’s a heavenly sight in pictures but mighty hard to climb in real life. Climbing Everest, Annapurna, or Manaslu means enduring freezing cold, biting air, and days of physical and mental strain until you reach the summit. The journey is a slippery path of rocks, rivers, and bridges, navigated skillfully by experienced trekkers, locals, and guides. In 2022, Nepal welcomed 15,781 trekkers, highlighting the importance of climbing and trekking guides for the country's economy.For new trekkers, understanding the trek can be confusing. If you’re anxious about missing something in your backpack or need motivation to start a trek, here are tips from two seasoned guides to help you grasp the essentials.Meet Luckme Syangden, a 25-year-old climbing guide with extensive experience in the treacherous heights of Everest. According to Syangden, maintaining a positive mindset is the first step towards a successful climb, both before and throughout the entire process.Preparation for the journeyTrekking is undeniably demanding, both physically and mentally. However, maintaining a ‘can-do’ attitude can go a long way in pushing people to their destination, says Syangden. “We never force the people to push through if we think they’ve reached their limits, but we do try to use ourselves as an example to show that they can,” says Syangden. According to Syangden, when you’re guiding so many people through the process of climbing, you realise that everybody is different; their bodies have different needs and limitations. So it’s important to move forward while assessing their physical and mental well-being. “We always maintain a strong, positive mindset ourselves and strive to inspire our trekkers with the same optimism. Rushing them when they’re unwell isn’t our approach,” says Syangden.Manu Rai, 32, has been a trekking guide for three years. Her passion for physical activities and exploring the vast landscapes of her village led her to this profession. Rai, an avid walker and traveller, found her calling when she met fellow adventure enthusiasts who shared her love for hiking and trekking. According to Rai, engaging in physical activities and regular workouts can significantly enhance the strength needed for embarking confidently on a trek.For novice trekkers, it’s advisable to begin preparing at least a month prior to the trek. Joining a gym or engaging in physical activities like walking can make a significant difference. Start with a 20-minute walk on the first day and gradually extend the duration as the trek approaches. This gradual increase helps in building strength, endurance, and confidence. Additionally, regular stretching is essential to loosen the muscles, reducing the risk of injuries while navigating challenging terrains. Personally, I've found going to the gym and incorporating squats into my routine immensely beneficial in strengthening my leg muscles. Backpacking essentialsWhen backpacking, packing wisely is key. Rai advises opting for light yet warm clothing instead of bulky jackets to reduce the load. She recommends essentials like down jackets, caps, goggles, sunglasses, sunscreen, a stick, warmer, gloves, socks, and sturdy boots. Syangden, who also carries the same essentials, stresses the importance of carrying a safety knife and period supplies for female trekkers.Managing periods during treksManaging periods during treks can be challenging, as Syangden points out. “I carry all of the supplies that I need, but as you can imagine, handling period cramps and all the other symptoms while trekking through gruelling mountains is no easy task. I just do my best to power through it all,” says Syangden.Handling altitude sickness and injuriesRai advises trekkers to rest and wait if altitude sickness strikes. Carrying painkillers and paracetamol is essential. If conditions worsen, trekkers can choose to halt their trip. In such cases, communication with fellow travellers and guides is key. Guides can also arrange transportation for the trekker’s return if needed. Effective communication with trekkers and guidesSyangden highlights the importance of communication and building positive relationships with fellow trekkers. Over her journey from being a beginner to a seasoned guide, she has learned that talking and fostering a friendly rapport with clients significantly smoothens the trek.“In my initial guiding days, communication was tough, but now I can confidently lead trekking groups,” Syangden states.Challenges faced by a female trekkersBoth Syangden and Rai acknowledge the challenges faced by female trekkers. They often encounter underestimation and demeaning comments questioning their trekking abilities. Syangden has personally dealt with such remarks, reflecting a wider issue where being a woman is wrongly linked to an inability to handle the physical demands of trekking. Becoming a trekking guideTrekkers and adventure-seekers may come to the realisation that their love for the mountains and hills can translate itself to a profession that not only supports their own passion but also that of those enthusiastic about the secrets of the mountains. According to both Syangden and Rai, the first step is to connect with a trekking association and enrol in a trekking guide course. Rai explains that this course covers essential skills like map reading, navigation, guiding techniques, geography, safety measures, and environmental knowledge.Additionally, Syangden, who is currently undergoing a climbing course, mentions that colleges now offer bachelor’s programmes in mountaineering, providing a comprehensive education for aspiring guides. \nFive young female travellers, Binita Jirel, Menuka Gurung, Juliana Shrestha, Rejina Tamang, and Shanti Rai, noticed a gap in the outdoor industry for a women-specific platform. So, they set out to build a platform that would encourage and empower women to travel the world and launched Duluwa Outdoors in 2021.The organisation’s social media posts generate much interest from women who want to travel alone but haven’t yet. The platform has become a hub for women to connect and share experiences. Shrestha discussed the possibilities of solo travelling for women in Nepal and her tips to individuals who are just starting their journey with the Post.Is travelling alone safe in Nepal? Since it has long been a well-liked vacation spot (for international tourists), Nepal has seen a lot of solo travellers. Besides the large number of foreigners exploring the Himalayas during their gap years, many Nepalis also travel the country solo. Most of them finish their journeys safely. So yes, Nepal is pretty safe for solo travelling.An example many overlook while talking about females travelling solo in Nepal is women travelling from their house to their parent’s house alone. This has been happening for decades and is a common thing most married women do multiple times in their lives. I say everyone should try travelling by themselves at least once in their life. I’m happy to see that many young people are travelling solo these days.What are some good solo travel destinations in Nepal?It’s tough to pick out just ten, as preferences vary from person to person. If you’re new to travelling alone, consider starting small with activities like going to the movies or having dinner alone. You could also begin hiking to places like Shivapuri, Namo Buddha, or Champadevi in Kathmandu.As you become more comfortable with solo travel, you can take short trips, like a long weekend in Pokhara-Bandipur. Make sure you consider nearby resources and the availability of transportation before you start your trips. When you return, I encourage you to reflect on your journey and see what you’ve learned—about yourself and the world. Then challenge yourself a little bit more. Nepal has so much to offer from trekking in the mountains. The Annapurna area is a great place to start. The trails are accessible and well-maintained, with plenty of facilities. You’ll also find other trekkers to connect with along the way. For those interested in exploring the valleys and towns along the hills, try places like Illam, Dharan-Dhankuta, and Palpa.Finally, for those looking to experience Nepal’s rich wildlife, destinations like Chitwan, Bardiya, and Shuklaphanta are all great choices.What are your tips for people who are just starting to travel alone?Plan at all times! Do your research on the fundamentals of travel, including transportation, lodging, connectivity, risk assessment, and activities.It’s also crucial to understand the type of trail or journey you’re taking so that you can dress appropriately and prepare for any potential risks, such as altitude sickness or accidents.Remember to budget appropriately and always have an emergency fund and research prices of essentials to avoid getting ripped off.What are some travel safety tips you swear by?Safety is a personal and situational concern that frequently arises when women travel alone.If you are just starting out, I’d advise you to get to a settlement before it gets dark—by 4:30-5:00 pm—when you are on long treks. Stay there overnight and continue on your journey the next morning.Be wary of wild animal attacks or possible natural disasters when you’re out in the wilderness. I would also suggest you consider taking a wilderness first aid course.Most importantly, be wary of other people. Trust your gut. If you think someone is suspect, keep your distance. Keep your loved ones, friends, or anyone else in your support network informed of your whereabouts, especially if you’re going to be in a place without service. Let them know when you might get service again so they won’t worry. \nNepal made a disastrous start to their 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World campaign on their return to the cricket’s biggest stage after a decade as they lost their opening match of the Group D to the Netherlands by six wickets in Dallas, Texas on Tuesday.Nepal, who were invited to bat first after losing the toss, posted a paltry 106 all out from 19.2 overs at the Grand Prairie Stadium after the batters struggled against a disciplined Dutch bowling.The Rhinos repeated the same mistakes with the bat as openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh failed to give their team a good start again after the play was slightly delayed due to wet outfield.Netherlands spinner Tim Pringle (3-20) and pacer Logan van Beek (3-18) were the biggest thorns in Nepal’s flesh as their three-wicket hauls put Nepal inside the pressure cooker in an overcast condition throughout the innings.In between, Paul van Meekeren and Bas de Leede also bowled excellently in the bowling-friendly surface, finishing 2-19 and 2-22, respectively.Nepal found themselves in big trouble early on at 15-2 in 3.1 overs when they lost Shiekh to Pringle for four in the second over and Bhurtel to van Beek for seven.Anil Sah departed next for 11 after Pringle had him caught by van Beek, leaving Nepal at 40-3.Skipper Rohit Paudel was the only batter who looked comfortable against the Dutch bowling attack that struck regularly. Paudel played a brisk 35 runs off 37 balls to revive Nepal innings, but he never found support in the middle order as Kushal Malla (9), Dipendra Singh Airee (1) and Sompal Kami (0) all fell in quick succession.Paudel’s resistance also ended in the 16th over when Pringle had him caught by Max O’Dowd for his third wicket.Karan KC scored 12-ball 17 and Gulsan Jha played 15-ball 14 to take Nepal to 106 from 84-7, but the final three wickets tumbled swiftly and without adding a run after van Beek struck twice in successive balls in the 20th over.Paudel conceded they could have stretched their total a little further.“The conditions while batting were really challenging,” the Nepal skipper said. “Netherlands bowled really well. We could have stretched it a little more and had more partnerships through the middle.”The Netherlands captain Scott Edwards credited the bowlers for their match-winning show.\"Our bowlers were awesome,” he said. “We got two or three wickets in the powerplay. All five of our bowlers were brilliant.”In response, Nepal bowled tightly, but could not stop O’Dowd to take the Dutch past the 107-run target with eight balls to spare. The Netherlands lost their opener Michael Levitt for a cheap one after Sompal Kami had him caught by Airee in 1.2 overs.But O’Dowd scored an unbeaten half-century to guide his side to 109-4 in 18.4 overs.O’Dowd smashed a patient knock of 48-ball 54 that featured four boundaries and one six.Despite a tenacious bowling attack, Nepal gave the Dutch the edge in the game after Sheikh, Kami and Paudel all dropped catches, which otherwise would have put their opponents under extra pressure.\"We did very well as a bowling unit,” Paudel said after the loss. “The last catch that I dropped was not well…and we didn't catch well.”Levitt and Singh, who played 22 runs off 28 balls, added 40 runs for the second wicket to steady the ship, before Sybrand Engelbrecht played 16-ball 14 to take the Dutch closer to the target.O’Dowd then smacked Abinash Bohara with two fours and six off the 19th over to wrap things up for the Dutch.“Ideally, we would have got the runs a little quicker, but it was great the way Max batted, and Bassie finished it off well,” Edwards said.Nepal next play against Sri Lanka on June 11. \nNepal will aim to impress at the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies when they launch their campaign against the Netherlands at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Dallas on Tuesday.Drawn in Group D, the Rhinos will play their next group matches against Sri Lanka in Florida on June 12, followed by clashes against South Africa on June 15 and against Bangladesh on June 17 in the Caribbean. Nepal, ranked 17th in the men’s T20I, are one of the top four highest-placed associated nations in the tournament. The young guns, led by 21-year-old captain Rohit Paudel, have the potential to cause an upset at the cricket tournament’s biggest stage and will aim to make history by progressing from the group stage.The top two teams from each of the four groups will reach the Super Eight stage. But their recent form—and a group including three full member nations and surprise elements the Netherlands—suggests that making it into the Super Eight will be difficult.Nepal will be making their first appearance at the World Cup since the World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. They have never qualified for the 50-over Cricket World Cup and are the least experienced side in the group.They are heading into the World Cup following a series of disappointing results, including the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup debacle and a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada.Inconsistencies with the bat have been one of their biggest headaches so far.Openers Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh have failed to live up to the billing lately, resulting in a failure to give the team a good start. Three years ago, on April 17, 2021, when the duo fearlessly put on a record-breaking 116-run opening stand against the Netherlands in their T20I debut in Kirtipur during the Nepal Tri-Nation T20I Series, the impression was that Nepal had finally found the missing piece of their top batting order.However, questions have been raised over their form as the opening duo has failed to build any impressive partnership recently, especially this year.Bhurtel—despite being one of the three Nepali batters alongside Paudel and Dipendra Singh Airee to have crossed 1,000 T20I runs—is experiencing the worst year of his career and is showing no signs of improvement. In his last four T20I innings, he was dismissed for three ducks in a row during the Premier Cup, and for 10 runs against Canada during the World Cup warm-up. In between, he played knocks of 16, 2, 1 and 13 against West Indies A.Shiekh has also been unsteady with the bat. He scored a fifty against West Indies A and 22 against Canada in the World Cup warm-up but failed to cross double-digit figures in his previous four outings.Nepal’s batting display will heavily rely on skipper Paudel, who usually bats at number three, and big-hitter finisher Airee.Paudel is the most consistent batter in the Nepal squad. He is at his prime and entering the World Cup having scored 265 runs in his four innings that included a century and two half-centuries against West Indies A.Allrounder Airee holds the record for fastest T20I fifty. More recently, he entered the elite club when he smashed six sixes in an over against Qatar during the T20I Premier Cup, becoming the only third man to do so after Yuvraj Singh in 2007 and Keiron Pollard in 2021.Airee will certainly be the trump card of Nepal’s batting order at the World Cup.Kushal Malla, whose 34-ball hundred against Mongolia is the second fastest T20I century, is also expected to kindle fireworks.Nepal’s bowling unit will be another key strength at the World Cup, as they demonstrated in the warm-up game against Canada. They proved effective in the middle overs and struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries to limit Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over.All-rounder Sompal Kami—the only player from Nepal’s 2014 World Cup squad to feature in the 2024 edition—will bring hordes of experience in the bowling department and will lead the fast bowling alongside cult hero Karan KC, who is the highest wicket-taker in Nepal’s squad with 90 wickets from 68 innings.Lalit Rajbanshi will lead the spin threat alongside Sagar Dhakal, who is proving his worth by taking seven wickets in his last four matches.However, all eyes will be on Abinash Bohara, who will be crucial for Nepal at the back end of the innings as the majority of his wickets have come in the death overs. Since making his debut in 2019, Bohara has taken 74 wickets from 56 innings, which is the third highest for Nepal.Nepal will still be the heavy underdogs in the group, especially against 2014 world champions Sri Lanka and 2009 and 2014 semi-finalists South Africa. This will be the first time Nepal will face Sri Lanka and South Africa. Paudel, who is the youngest captain in the United States and the West Indies among the 20 participating nations, believes Nepal can do well at the World Cup. “I have faith in my team. They will give their best, be it in opening batting or other departments,” said Paudel, who added that the role of openers would be important. “It is upon the opening batters to get the team off to a good start,” he added.“In T20 cricket, no team is really a favourite. The Netherlands defeated Sri Lanka in the warm-up game. The United States beat Bangladesh twice for a historic 2-1 series victory. That’s why I believe we can and we will [compete].”If Nepal are to build momentum for the Super Eight stage, they will need to overcome their first hurdle against familiar foes Netherlands, who are making their fifth appearance at the T20 World Cup. But it will not be an easy task against the tricky Dutch, who are on the verge of completing a hat-trick of wins against the Proteas after defeating them in the 2022 T20 World Cup and the 2023 Cricket World Cup.“Our team is focused on the Netherlands match because it is very important for us to win that game and carry the thrust to the following matches. Our players are also well aware of their respective roles,” Paudel added.Nepal can also present a thrilling challenge to a Bangladesh team, who are reeling after hitting a new low after losing a series against inexperienced and tournament debutants, the US. The Tigers also lost to Zimbabwe by eight wickets in a T20I series earlier this month.This will be the second meeting between Nepal and Bangladesh. In fact, Bangladesh defeated Nepal by eight wickets in the group stage of the 2014 World Cup and progressed into the second round. The Bangladeshis have never made it to the knockout stages across eight editions of the tournament. \nNepal’s leg spinner Sandeep Lamichhane’s hopes to participate in the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup in the United States and the West Indies all but ended after the US Embassy in Kathmandu rejected him a visa for a second time in ten days.The embassy had called Lamichhane for an interview for a second time on Thursday afternoon following a diplomatic note sent by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had requested the government and other stakeholders to take initiatives after Lamichhane was initially denied a visa last week.CAN confirmed Lamichhane’s visa denial in a press release on Thursday.“Despite taking necessary initiatives, along with the diplomatic note, from the government of Nepal, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Youth and Sports, National Sports Council, CAN and International Cricket Council (ICC) for cricketer Sandeep Lamichhane’s visit to participate in the 2024 ICC Men's T20 World Cup in the United States and West Indies, the US Embassy has expressed its inability to give travel permission (visa) to national player Lamichhane to play the World Cup,” CAN stated. After initially denying visa to Lamichhane, the embassy had said it could not comment on individual visa cases ‘as visa records are confidential under US law.’“The US Embassy in Kathmandu and other US consular posts around the world have made a concerted effort to ensure that members of national cricket teams who qualify for the appropriate visa class are able to travel in time to compete in the World Cup,” the embassy said last week.“We cannot comment on individual visa cases as visa records are confidential under US law.”Lamichhane’s supporters had taken to streets on Wednesday to express their disappointment over visa denial to the cricketer.The country’s cricket governing body had submitted a list of only 14 players to the ICC on the May 25 deadline, leaving one slot for Lamichhane in hope that the cricketer would get a visa.The former national cricket team captain was not included in the provisional squad because the Kathmandu District Court had convicted him of raping a girl in a hotel in Kathmandu in August 2022 and had sentenced him to eight years in jail in January this year.CAN had lifted suspension on Lamichhane clearing his path to participate in the national and international cricket after Patan High Court acquited him of rape on appeal earlier this month.The cricket body had immediately started preparation to send Lamichhane to the US after lifting his ban.CAN had also talked to the ICC and secured approval from the world cricket governing body to include Lamichhane in the World Cup squad if he received a visa.Before the rape trial, Lamichhane had enjoyed a glittering career. He is the first and the only Nepali cricketer to play in the Indian Premier League. He was also sought after by T20 leagues around the globe. However, Lamichhane’s success came to a sudden fall when ‘Gaushala 26’—the name police gave to the victim—filed a rape complaint against him.Lamichhane was in Trinidad & Tobago to play in the Caribbean Premier League from Jamaica Tallawahs when the rape complaint was filed.Following the rape charge and subsequent arrest warrant issued by the Kathmandu District Court, CAN had dismissed Lamichhane as national captain and suspended him from cricket.He returned to the national team in February last year and participated in the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 home tri-series against Namibia and Scotland, after he was freed on bail.He also travelled to Zimbabwe in June last year to participate in the ICC Cricket World Cup Qualifier and to India to play the 2023 Asia Cup three months later.Lamichhane was part of the squad that reached the semi finals of the ICC Men’s T20 World Cup Asia Qualifier in October last year to book their ticket to the T20 World Cup after a decade. Nepal made their World Cup debut in World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014.He was again suspended from cricketing activities after Kathmandu District Court convicted him in the rape charge.Lamichhane’s visa rejections means the current 15-member team, who are already in the United States, will likely play the T20 World Cup.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.The US will host 16 group games in three venues—Florida, Texas and New York—while the rest of the tournament including the Super Eight stage, semi-finals and the final will be held in the West Indies. \nNepal will take on the United States on Thursday in their final warmup match in Dallas ahead of the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup. The Rhinos are scheduled to begin their World Cup campaign by playing against the Netherlands on June 4.On Wednesday, the Nepali squad, including nine players who attended the training session, exerted themselves at the Mustangs Cricket Academy in Dallas. The team was notably relieved by the return of Dipendra Singh Airee, whose presence is expected to significantly bolster the squad’s performance. Airee had sustained an ankle injury in St. Vincent, West Indies. His absence extended to the practice match in Houston, US, where he was unable to participate.“Airee has returned to training today and looked in good form. So he will play against the United States,” said skipper Rohit Paudel after the training.Nepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm-up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday. “We are ready for the match against the United States. We have struggled in the batting in power plays,” said Paudel. “I am confident that we will also do well in the World Cup with these two warm up games.”Paudel stressed Nepal’s unique advantage in these warm up matches, particularly since they are taking place on the same ground where Nepal will face the Netherlands on June 4. According to him, this provides the team with a valuable opportunity to familiarise themselves with the conditions and make strategies accordingly.This will mark the United States’ first warm up game ahead of the World Cup. Their previous warm up match against Bangladesh was washed out by rain, with no single ball bowled. The United States will begin their World Cup campaign against Canada in the inaugural match of the tournament on June 1.Photos: Hemanta Shrestha \nNepal began their preparations for the 2024 ICC Men’s T20 World Cup with a heavy 63-run warm up defeat against Canada at the Grand Prairie Stadium in Texas on Monday, thanks to their batting consistencies that have come back to haunt them since the turn of the year.Last year, Nepal’s batting won the hearts of many when they pulled off a sensational comeback to win 11 out of 12 matches of the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup League 2 and qualified for the ICC Men’s Cricket World Cup Qualifier. The Rhinos also qualified for their maiden Asia Cup and ended the year by securing their ticket to the T20 World Cup for the first time since 2014.But all that steel and resilience now seem to have suddenly vanished into the thin air.The year 2024 has been a rollercoaster ride for Rohit Paudel’s Rhinos, even in their roaring and perfect hunting ground—TU Cricket Ground, Kirtipur. They opened the League 2 with a loss against Namibia which ended their 15-match winning streak at home and won only one of their four matches of the home tri-series.They also failed to qualify for the 2025 Asia Cup last month and a four-wicket defeat to less fancied side Hong Kong in the third-place playoff of the ACC Men’s T20 Premier Cup also banished them out of the 2024 ACC Emerging Teams Asia Cup.One of their memorable moments came when they swept the three-match bilateral series against Canada in Kirtipur in their opening event of the year.However, their batting has been characterised by unsteadiness since and it was out in the open again against Canada in their first warm-up match of the T20 World Cup.Nepal’s bowling unit has been their strength always and proved key in the middle overs on Monday as well when they struck five times in the space of 27 deliveries limiting Canada from 111-2 in the 14th over to 135-7 in the 18th over, with Abinash Bohara taking 2-27, and Karan KC, Sompal Kami, Gulsan Jha, Lalit Rajbanshi and Sagar Dhakal all picking up one wicket each.Nicholas Kriton’s 50 runs off 39 balls and opener Navneet Dhaliwal’s 32 runs off 27 balls had driven Canada past 100 to give them a great start.Despite a tight bowling from Nepal, Ravinderpal Singh’s explosive 17-ball 41 guided Canada to 183-7.Nepal could never stay in the chase of an 184-run target.Opener Kushal Bhurtel and Aasif Sheikh struggled again and departed making 10 (16) and 22 (22), respectively.Skipper Paudel has been the most consistent batter for Nepal. He was Nepal’s leading run-scorer last year with 403 T20I runs from 13 innings and was facing Canada having scored 265 runs from four innings that included a century and two half-centuries—all of which came during the five-match T20 series West Indies A.He was out for a duck in his last outing—the fifth T20 against West Indies A—and failed to make a mark again after being dismissed for one.Sundeep Jora (6), Jha (0), Kami (4), Dhakal (5) and Bohara (0) all handled the bat poorly and returned to the pavilion with single digit scores, as Nepal could not only manage 120 runs.Canada’s Dilon Heyliger returned the match figures of 4-20 in this 2.3 over spell. Jeremy Gordon and Saad Bin Zafar took two wickets each while Kaleem Sana and Pragat Singh pocketed one wicket apiece.Malla and Dipendra Singh Airee also had a golden year in 2023.During the Asian Games, Malla scored a century off just 34 balls against Mongolia. The score stands as the second fastest T20I century. Malla scored 402 runs in his 12 innings last year. After struggling with the bat most of this year, he is regaining his shape gradually at a perfect time. He top-scored against Canada with 37 runs off 30 balls, carrying his form from this last match against West Indies A where he scored a valiant 37 not out off 18 balls.Airee is Nepal’s highest run-scorer in the T20Is with 1626 runs from 56 innings. He scored a 50 off just nine balls against Mongolia last year to break the record for fastest fifty in T20s. A month ago, the big-hitting finisher smashed six sixes in an over during the Premier Cup against Qatar, joining the ranks of Yuvraj Singh and Kieron Pollard in achieving the rare feat in men’s T20I. Airee did not bat against Canada.Anil Sah’s batting does not look like a bigger concern. He was outstanding again and comfortably scored 24 runs off 16 balls. He returned to the national team for Nepal’s home series against Canada in February and immediately made an impact with a fifty and an unbeaten century. Although he lost his form following the Canada series win, he has refound his confidence lately. He scored a half-century against West Indies A in what was his last inning before the Canada warm up.Nepal will face co-hosts United States in their second warm-up game on Thursday.Nepal, drawn in Group D, begin their T20 World Cup against the Netherlands on June 4 in Dallas, followed by group matches against Sri Lanka on June 12, South Africa on June 15 and Bangladesh on June 17.Nepal are making only their second appearance at a cricket World Cup—their first since World T20 in Bangladesh in 2014. \nExit polls could not accurately capture discontent among the social and economic castes that are ranked lower in India in key states, resulting in an overestimation of electoral support for Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s ruling party, two pollsters said.The findings led to turmoil in Indian stock markets on Tuesday, after rosier projections for Modi in the general election earlier boosted markets.Three of five polls initially projected Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party would win more than the 303 electoral seats it won in 2019, while the opposition “INDIA” alliance led by Rahul Gandhi’s Congress party would win 125 to 182 seats.The predictions boosted financial markets ahead of the release of elections results on Tuesday.However, vote counts showed much lower numbers - around 240 for the BJP and 293 for Modi’s alliance that includes regional parties. That caused the worst intraday fall in stocks since March 2020 on concerns over challenges for implementing economic reforms due to Modi’s dependence on allies.Pradeep Gupta, head of Axis My India poll agency, said the survey failed to capture a shift among voters in the less privileged sections of society in Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Maharashtra states, where 170 seats in total were up for grabs, and where BJP lost a whopping 45 seats, compared to 2019.“This is our mistake,” Gupta said.He noted many voters in those sections of society didn’t disclose their voting decisions for fear of being attacked by electoral workers who did not share their political views.“We could not predict as accurately as we are known for,” he said, referring to challenges in capturing how voters had swung in favour of the opposition from other regional parties.Over 900 people were deployed for face-to-face post-ballot interviews with a sample of 582,000 voters, with the response rate varying from 40-50% in urban areas and 70-80% in rural areas, Gupta said.Many women voters asked males in their families to respond on their behalf, resulting in wrong estimations of their voting decisions, he said.“We are wrong in 2024,” said Yashwant Deshmukh, head of CVoter polling agency, whose numbers were overestimated by about 50 seats in favour of Modi’s party amid incorrect projections for Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan.“I wish I could stop giving seat numbers but that’s a professional hazard” as the media keeps asking for those estimates, Deshmukh said. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nGyanumaya BK had been suffering from severe backaches for a while. The resident of Pokhara-15, BK visited the Metrocity Hospital in Srijanachowk seeking treatment five months ago. The 69-year-old, who works as a labourer, has already spent over Rs50,000 on follow-up checkups and medications.BK spent eight days in the hospital in January and has been paying off loans she had taken to pay her bills and for follow-up visits to the hospital. Had BK been aware of the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020, which private hospitals must adhere to, she wouldn’t have had to borrow money to pay her medical bills. As per the regulations, hospitals must set aside 10 percent of their total beds to the underprivileged and needy.“I didn’t know hospitals were required to provide free treatment to those who can’t afford hospital stays,” BK said. “But even if I did, I would have to fight to get the service as the hospital won’t willingly offer me the service.”The Pokhara-based 50-bed hospital’s Chief Executive Officer Gyan Prasad Aryal admits that his hospital does not adhere to the mandate. “We don’t have explicit information from the health ministry on the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020,” said Aryal. “Moving forward, we will follow the instructions.” The hospital authorities say they give a 10-15 percent discount on the final hospital bill as opposed to dedicating 10 percent of their beds and free treatment and medications to the less privileged. Hospitals with 15 beds come under the jurisdiction of the local units while those with up to 50 beds fall under the ambit of the Provincial Health Directorate. Likewise, the Provincial Health Ministry oversees health facilities with over 50 beds.However, no regulatory body has data on whether health facilities are following government rules, especially Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. But it is an open secret that most private hospitals in Pokhara are not following the regulations.Pokhara Municipality Health Department Officer Yadunath Baral, Kaski District Health Officer Bhim Prasad Poudel, and Province Health Director Khim Bahadur Khadka all admit that local hospitals disregard the regulations. “Our monitoring and inspection is also lax, that’s why most hospitals ignore the rules,” he said. He says lack of manpower hampers effective inspection. “Our manpower is enough to conduct inspections in other districts, but not in Kaski, which has many private hospitals,” he said. “We need more people for that”. According to Baral, although the hospitals claim to offer a certain discount on final bills to the needy, they are unable to show the record of the discounts provided. “The hospitals claim they give discounts, but most hospitals have not even been able to show us the proof,” said Khadka. “Legal actions should be taken against the hospitals that fail to submit a monthly report on the free services for the poor. More importantly, they must be liable for flouting government standards that aim to benefit the poor.” The Provincial Health Directorate also does not have any data on the directive’s implementation at hospitals with more than 50 beds.The department’s chief of health services Dr Ramesh KC says that they have been working on updating information of health services in the Gandaki region. “Hospitals have failed to submit their mandatory monthly reports. We will seek that information when they come for new permits or permit renewal,” KC said. There are 27 privately-owned hospitals within the Pokhara Metropolitan City and 39 in the Gandaki region. Bharatpur Metropolitan City in Chitwan in Bagmati Province is also called the ‘medical city’  as it is home to 23 private hospitals with a total of 1,200 beds. Additionally, there are multiple large-scale government hospitals and two medical colleges—Chitwan Medical College and College of Medical Sciences—that also provide medical services. Had the Health Facility Operation Standards-2020 been followed by the 23 private hospitals, 120 patients would have received free health services every year, according to Durgadutta Chapagain, chief of the Chitwan Health Office.“Although the hospitals claim they provide the services, none have been able to provide convincing proof. Instead, we found them giving such discounts to patients who are close to hospital operators,” said Chapagain. “Our department validates the permits for new health facilities and re-registrations for hospitals with a 25-bed capacity. We have asked such public health service providers to put up posters or stickers reading ‘Discounts for the needy’ on the hospital premises so that patients know what services they can get on discount.”Meanwhile, Bikram Adhikari, Secretary of the Private Hospitals Coordination Committee in Chitwan, claims that the regulations are impractical. “There are a few services that hospitals can provide free of cost. You cannot expect hospitals to provide all services for free. That’s why there is a need to amend the existing regulations,” said Adhikari.The monitoring bodies’ inaction and lackadaisical approach to ensuring that public health services are accessible and affordable to all makes private hospitals blatantly ignore government mandates.Bharatpur Metropolitan City’s Deputy Mayor Chitrasen Adhikari says that although the metropolis is aware that private hospitals must allocate 10 percent of their beds for free treatment of poor people, the metropolis administration has yet to devise a monitoring mechanism. “We have not taken any steps towards that end, but we will soon,” he said.Just like Pokhara and Chitwan, Biratnagar is also plagued with the same problem. There are 32 private hospitals currently in operation in the metropolis. Deepak Bhattarai, statistical officer at the municipality’s health office, asserts that none of the health facilities met the set requirements. A monthly report submitted by the Biratnagar-based Nobel Medical College and Teaching Hospital, which has 750 beds, stated that the hospital had provided the said concession to more than 400 patients. “However, the report did not clarify how many of the 400 patients were provided free hospital beds and the services that come along with the beds, and how many were given discounts on their hospital bills,” Bhattarai said. “We found that hospital reports also include concessions provided to patients who sought outpatient, emergency, and X-ray services.”The hospital’s director Narayan Dahal claims to be following all government instructions. He says 10 percent hospital beds are set aside for needy patients who are not charged any treatment fees, while 10 percent of service seekers also get discounts.Although the Biratnagar Metropolis has directed all health facilities under its jurisdiction to allocate free beds and provide free services to the needy, inform service seekers about the government-provided services, and submit a list of all patients who have received the services, the directive is ignored more often than followed. According to Bhattarai, medical establishments must get a letter from the local unit before making any upgrades or purchasing any equipment. “But the hospitals have been found presenting fake documents in order to acquire such permits,” he said. “The metropolis has refused such permits to 12 private hospitals in the current fiscal year.”Butwal Sub-Metropolitan City in the Lumbini Province has also taken no concrete step to ensure private hospitals adhere to Health Facility Operation Standards-2020. Despite having the authority to carry out inspections, the sub-metropolis’ apathy has deprived hundreds of needy patients of various government services. The sub-metropolis with 17 wards has more than two dozen big hospitals in the Butwal bazaar area itself. Not one of them adheres to the government’s health regulations. But the sub-metropolis is yet to monitor these hospitals. Yubraj Pandey, chief of Butwal Sub Metropolitan’s health department, says they have been unable to inspect medical institutes due to a lack of a proper set of rules.“I have just been transferred here. Discussions are underway to prepare legal requirements,” he said. Private hospitals in Butwal only began filing their reports two months ago after a joint meeting, informs Chief of the Sub Metropolitan’s Education and Health Department Mitramani Khanal. Twenty-year-old Suraj BK of Sarawal Rural Municipality-2 in West Nawalparasi got into a motorcycle accident on April 26. He suffered injuries on both his legs and was taken to Zenus Hospital and Research Centre in Butwal. Suraj was handed a bill of Rs 70,000 for treatment but he did not have the money to clear the bill and sought the hospital’s help. “The hospital refused to provide any discount. They in fact refused to discharge me. I got my discharge papers only four days later after I paid almost Rs 100,000,” he said. “I had to get a loan to pay the hospital bills as my father, who is a farmer, did not have that kind of money.”Dr Sharda Singh, the hospital director, said Suraj did not qualify for a discount as he did not have a recommendation letter from the local unit. “Patients have to get a recommendation to avail of free services at private hospitals but Suraj could not bring one,” she said. “I was in the hospital bed for four days. I could not have secured a recommendation from the local unit in that state,” said Suraj. Ishwari Prasad Chapagain, a civil society leader of Rupandehi and a member of the Consumer Interest Protection Forum, says private hospitals in Butwal are more interested in making money than helping those in need. “They do not follow government mandates. They act as if they have to bear the expenses of providing free service to the poor when in fact they get tax rebates and such for such services,” he said. “The sub-metropolis also does not do the needful. Everyone is corrupt including the city officials.”  \nAmong the three most populist parliamentarians of these times, Khadga Prasad Sharma Oli is the sharpest as well as the seniormost. He was born in the interregnum between the fall of the Ranarchy in 1951 and the rise of the absolutist Shah regime in 1960, when the Gramscian prognosis of “a great variety of morbid symptoms” was apparent throughout the country.Sharma Oli perhaps realised early on that the criteria for fitness for survival in the politics of Nepal differed from those of other newly decolonised countries. Freedom fighters of independence movements had to paint the picture of a brighter future to persuade the masses. Here, King Mahendra had convinced his loyal subjects that they should long for the greatness of the “unifier”, the creations of the “versifier”, and the valour of “mercenaries” instead. Even though he is the unchallenged supremo of a supposedly Marxist-Leninist party, Sharma Oli prefers to talk about culture, religion and language rather than the plight of the poor and the downtrodden. A rhetorician par excellence, he can make his audience consume irrelevant claims about Ayodhya being in Thori and Yoga having originated in Nepal.A relic of the print and audio era, Sharma Oli refuses to accept that historical fabrications and jingoistic stories look somewhat dubious on small screens of handheld devices. The sell-by date of Sharma Oli’s alt-right populism seems to be losing its mass appeal. It must be in desperation that he had to aim cheap and chauvinistic barbs at the fellow parliamentarian Sumana Shrestha. Born in 1974, Home Minister and Deputy Prime Minister Rabi Lamichhane belongs to the Mahendramala Generation that grew up in the ideological hegemony of ethnonational chauvinism in the 1980s and 1990s. Setting a world record of sorts in 2013 with his single-themed and longest-running talk show, he is the political manipulator of the television age. Lamichhane succeeded in fanning popular discontent against established parties through his Sidha Kura Janata Sanga and then decided to electorally encash the adulation before the audience could know much about his dual passport, possible involvement in cooperative frauds or the vacuity of his political antics. He is no longer the poster boy for alternative politics.Performative agitator The chief whip of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party (RPP), Gyanendra Bahadur Shahi, is the new kid on the jingoistic block. He is wrestling to create a space for himself in the post-2015 order where the ruling ideology is that there is no distinct ideology in the political economy. Born in 1992 and a child of restored constitutional monarchy, Shahi came of age in yet another Gramscian interregnum between 2006 and 2016 when ethnonational majoritarianism triumphed over the inclusionary dreams of participatory democracy. Experiences of electoral democracies in Pakistan or Sri Lanka have shown that ethnonational majoritarianism inevitably brings authoritarian politics, nepotism, favouritism, crony capitalism and brazen corruption. In such polities, the risk of a rabble-rouser spouting rage against the ‘rotten elite’ is extremely high. Imran Khan rode the anti-establishment beast to get to the top, where the creature ate his political career raw. He is presently cooling his heels in jail. The movement of India Against Corruption (IAC) catapulted Arvind Kejriwal to the chair of Chief Minister of New Delhi, where, ironically, he is in custody on corruption charges. Shahi tried to ride a similar escalator of anti-corruption vigilantism through his combative politics captured live on camera and beamed through social media. He became viral through his Hamro Nepal Hami Nepali Abhiyan (Our Nepal, We Nepalis Campaign) by participating in protests against the Nepal Compact of Millenium Challenge Corporation (MCC). It seems the adroit agitator has realised that his jingoistic image needs periodic polishing for him to thrive in the emotionally distressed republic. He recently joined the campaign for the social rehabilitation of Sandeep Lamichhane, a celebrity cricketer first convicted of raping a minor, sentenced to jail and then acquitted by a higher court. The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) had included the former captain in its T20 World Cup team. Once the USA denied him a visa, the CAN could have let the prospective player hone his spin-bowling skills at home. But it decided to solicit the help of the government to make the consular services of the US Embassy rethink. They did some serious rethinking and once again denied Lamichhane a visa. The unfortunate story should have ended there, but the anti-MCC campaigner made a grand entry, heading a procession against the US Embassy!Shahi didn’t stop there: He later claimed in Parliament that the denial of a visa to Lamichhane was an affront to the entire country. Perhaps Shahi perceives that an anti-USA constituency still exists in the country that he can mobilise for his regressive politics. He may have been too young back then, but more prominent personalities of Nepal have been refused a visa in the past. No matter how high you are within the geography of one of the 50 poorest countries of the world with one of its lowest-ranking passports, resident diplomats of wealthier nations remain unimpressed with the “Buddha was born in Nepal” rhetoric.Herd mentalityIn his long public life, Abhi Subedi has worn many hats of different hues—discarding one for the other or donning one atop another depending upon his mood—with the ease of a bohemian. He is a professor, poet, playwright, critic, academic, commentator, researcher, creator, wanderer, writer, translator, bilingual columnist and voracious reader: An intellectual in one word.Back in 2006, Subedi was brusquely denied a visa to visit New York at the invitation of American writers. He was reportedly told: “You seem to have visited so many places. How come? Are you retired? Will you return?” And then dismissed with a gratuitous advice: “Try again.” When Subedi wrote about the incident with a touch of sadness in his column “Visa and empire of indifference”, the then US Ambassador to Nepal James Francis Moriarty expressed regret at the treatment meted out to “long a cultural contact of our American Center” but refused to publicly apologise.Khagendra Sangraula—a writer and translator so popular that he needs no introduction—with the British Embassy in 2005 had a no less disturbing experience. He was given a written note explaining that the visa denial was based on the possibility that he may not leave Britain after entering. Once again, Sangraula wrote about it in the form of a letter in one of his columns, but nothing was heard from the then British Ambassador Keith G Bloomfield.Subedi and Sangraula were wise enough to realise that denial of visa is the prerogative of the issuing country. Shahi wants to capitalise on this to strengthen his capability of benefiting from the herd mentality of cynical and discontented youths who consume incendiary social media posts and are looking for an easy outlet to vent their rage. Some populists can do good for their political benefit, but a rabble-rouser inevitably causes unmitigated disaster. Shahi isn’t just a person but a political model that can prove to be much more damaging than Sharma Oli’s ethnonational populism or Lamichhane’s downright demagoguery. \nFossil fuels are being rapidly displaced by decarbonised sources of energy but not everyone is yet onboard. The resolution adopted at the end of COP28 last December was described as the \"beginning of the end\" for the fossil fuel era. While such an announcement was met with much cynicism, maybe it was indeed the turning point.The past six months have provided even more evidence that fossil fuels are being rapidly overcome by the new technologies of decarbonisation: Wind, solar, batteries and electric vehicles. These are now growing at super exponential rates showing that businesses, governments and communities are learning how to implement them in cities and regions.All fossil fuels are either plateauing or showing negative growth. The peaks for coal, oil and gas show how rapid their decline will be. The responses from the fossil fuel lobby have been largely of derision and instead of showing that they are in decline and must diversify into these new technologies, they have opted for even bigger growth targets.Many oil and gas projects are showing growth targets beyond 2050 into 2070, in a bid to find finance from a world that is more and more backing the net zero-only finance option as demand for fossil fuels declines.Fossil fuel lobby sows confusionThis is causing political chaos as governments are caught between supporting climate action and supporting big fossil fuel companies promising massive investment. This confuses the public. Australia is an example.In the two years since its election, the federal Labor government has created many innovative programs and funds to enable the energy transition. But at the same time it is backing oil and gas project expansion that is seven times more climate-damaging than the gains in climate mitigation from the other programs.Chevron's carbon capture and storage project at the Gorgon gas field—the biggest demonstration of the technology in the world—has failed to meet its targets, casting doubt on the continued use of gas.Overviews of the technology are increasingly casting doubts on its commercial viability. Due to their impact on the global climate it is hard to see more than a small fraction of the fossil fuel projects ever getting their finance. It’s thus likely the fossil fuel lobby strategy to push ahead—as though COP28 never happened—will begin to collapse. It's expected that COP29 will confirm the support for a rapid decline in fossil fuels.Risk of COP29 backfiringLike COP28 it will be convened by an oil and gas-based nation. But the data are beginning to make the campaigns for more fossil fuels look like childish tantrums. And the natural world has been fighting back with the climate causing severe storms like the huge floods that hit Dubai in the months after COP28. No place is safe from global warming.Finance will have the major stake as they must invest in returns that last into the 2050s and these are increasingly threatened by the data trends and the climate itself.The Australian oil and gas company Woodside had 58 percent of its shareholders vote down the company's climate strategy, including its dependence on carbon capture and storage. COP29 will backfire unless more is agreed to accelerate the phase out of fossil fuels.Fossil fuel companies will increasingly find that unless they seriously join the diversification of their investments, they will disappear.The examples of Orsted in Denmark and Neste in Finland have demonstrated diversification to renewable-based fuels is commercially feasible by companies that previously worked on fossil fuels. Much more is needed and can be expected at COP29.UN climate chief Simon Stielle has put the world on notice: \"We've got two years left to save the planet. As we inch towards the point of no return, each year takes on more importance than the last.\" But the first steps were taken at COP28 by recognising that the era of fossil fuels is over. \nThe debate on the proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2024-25, beginning July 16, has begun in the federal Parliament. The debate, though, is a mere ritual. Neither is the debate likely to change the allocation of a single rupee nor is any resource available to upscale or add projects. However, the fiscal bill has somehow rightly diagnosed the maladies that hold back the growth of the Nepali economy. Economic activities could not expand due to a fall in consumer demand, low credit expansion, low capacity of the manufacturing sector and a decline in goods imports. Yet, the growth rate in the current fiscal year is expected to be 3.9 percent at producers’ prices as against only 3.1 percent estimated by the International Monetary Fund.Also, Finance Minister Barshaman Pun hoped to take the capital expenditure to Rs215.3 billion (71.3 percent of the capital allocation) and collect Rs1,253.5 billion (88.1 percent of the target) in around six weeks of the current fiscal year that remain. Even these substantially downsized targets are unlikely to be met. By June 2, the government had spent only Rs127.85 billion (42.32 percent of the allocation) towards capital expenditure and collected a revenue of Rs873.66 billion (61.42 percent of the target).Despite acknowledging these growth constraints, the proposed fiscal policy fails to prescribe credible means to restore the confidence of consumers and investors. It is only by restoring the confidence of consumers, investors, and the market that the economy can be reinvigorated. Ironically, the finance minister instead expects appreciation for being 'unambitious' and 'pragmatic' while setting a subdued revenue target of Rs1,260 billion and allocating a capital budget of Rs352.3 billion.Bulging deficitThe FY 2024-25 budget is a hugely deficit budget by Rs547.8 billion out of the total proposed outlay of Rs1,860.3 billion. The deficit alone is 29.44 percent of the allocation and 9.6 percent of the revised gross domestic product (GDP) value of Rs5,705 billion (USD 42.5 billion). In the coming fiscal year, Rs330 billion will be raised from domestic borrowings and Rs217.7 billion from external borrowings. Even if the revenue of Rs1,260 billion projected by the budget were to be collected, the government cannot escape the current expenditure of Rs1,140.6 billion and default on debt service obligation of Rs357.3 billion.This means that the sum of revenue and domestic debt will only be enough to cover the expenditures under these two headings, thus leaving an extremely thin scope for generating resources for the Rs352.3 billion allocated for capital expenditures. On the one hand, capital allocation is barely 19 percent of the total allocation, the lowest ratio in Nepal's budget history. On the other, Nepal faces a chronic problem of underspending the earmarked capital budget. An added risk is that due to declining consumption and imports, the revenue target seems unattainable. Raising loans from external lenders has always been challenging. For example, in the current fiscal year, only half of the expected Rs213 billion would be available for the government to mobilise. If all proposed debts are realised by the next fiscal year, the public debt will climb above 52 percent of GDP.Under such resource constraints, limited economic activities from the funds transferred by the federal government to the provincial and local levels might marginally contribute to growth and development. However, capital expenditure to implement the large and transformative projects of the federal government looks bleak. This essentially means that the country's economic growth will remain constricted for a few more years.'Transformative' prioritiesThe new budget has chosen five sectors as transformative: Agriculture, energy, information technology, tourism promotion, and entrepreneurship and industrial development. There is hardly any debate or novelty in these priorities and objectives. Some initiatives like added focus, at least in theory, on information technology are certainly timely and appropriate. But even in these chosen areas, the fiscal bill has remained short of removing key policy or structural bottlenecks that are proving daunting in realising the true potentials of these sectors. These missed opportunities could have been tapped mostly without draining the exchequer.Agricultural transformation without first arranging enough land for commercial agriculture is only a pipedream. Haphazard urbanisation has taken place on the most fertile land. The arable land is fragmented into generally tiny 30 million plots under the title of 13.5 million landowners. The average plot size is 0.3 hectares. The fault lies in the ad hoc and largely failed land use planning, which the government has failed to give due attention to.On energy, Nepal first needs to develop a comprehensive blueprint for the energy economy. On the one hand, the thrill of exporting electricity has swayed national emotion; on the other, industries are demanding to meet their demand for power before exporting it at much cheaper rates than they are charged. It is appropriate to develop an automatic system of providing tariff concessions to manufacturing industries proportionate to the value addition of their products. Lack of coordination among the government agencies overseeing land, forest, environment and infrastructure development remains the main impediment in the construction of both power projects and transmission lines.Despite bullish ambitions, the government has not been designating an appropriate location for an IT park and developing it with appropriate power, communication, and transport connectivity. Nepal also needs to think beyond adventure and backpacking tourism by developing unique-value products, destinations, and infrastructure to cater to high-value tourists.The most challenging of all has been to increase productivity and create employment opportunities. The contribution of manufacturing to GDP has fallen below the 4 percent mark. Chronic underinvestment has paralysed the industrial sector. Missing both backward and forward linkages has made the 'herding' model of industries unsustainable. In all these sectors, the budget has taken only a cosmetic approach rather than putting genuine efforts into transforming them. Some key sectors under pressure due to an economic downward spiral, like real estate and housing, cooperatives, microfinance and construction, are highly disappointed with the utter neglect of the budget to address their problems.Most importantly, the government has failed to realise that without a substantive stimulus package through bold fiscal and monetary policies, the economy has reached a stage of self-recovery on its own. Nepal is destined to reel under recession for some time to come. Growth is a further distant expectation. \nChiefs and deputy chiefs of over 150 local units from across the country have gathered in Kathmandu for a common agenda—to protest against the federal government’s decision to cut the budget already allocated to them. They picketed the finance ministry at Singha Durbar on Sunday to mount pressure on the federal government to release the money. According to them, the budget earmarked under the title of equalisation grants was not distributed as earlier promised. Local units get the equalisation grants in three tranches. They were entitled to 25 percent of the total grants in the third instalment, but they got only seven percent. According to elected local representatives, the federal administration’s act of cutting the allocated budget has caused them multiple problems as they had initiated several development projects and other activities with a plan to pay with the money from the equalisation grants. With the abrupt disruption of the source, they are now in a spot of bother. The finance ministry might have its own arguments behind stopping the budget, most likely a shortfall of resources as successive governments have failed to rejuvenate the country’s economy after the covid pandemic. The Pushpa Kamal Dahal government has been a failure on the economic front as it couldn’t even meet the target of revenue collection set in the annual budget. Nepali authorities have failed to apply any innovative idea or explore new resources to fill the gap. The authorities in Kathmandu could have found other ways such as applying austerity measures at the centre so as to avoid budget cuts to the local units. For one, cutting local units’ budgets won’t help the government’s goal of increasing capital expenditures.There are several options to fund development and other activities at the district, constituency and local levels. Allocation of the budget through equalisation grants is one. It is a more scientific and rational way of resource distribution as it is done in line with clear working procedures of the National Natural Resources and Finance Commission. The latest status of human development indicators including the situation of education, health and drinking water of a particular local unit or province; the situation of balanced development there; that of disparity based on economic, social or any other discrimination; the condition of infrastructure in the province and local units; the existing status and prospect of revenue generation; and the need of expenditure for the sub-national units are the criteria considered while allocating funds.The commission also takes the population of a sub-national unit as a basis to allocate budget under this category. For instance, units with less than 10,000 people get Rs1.25 million while those with more than 10,000 and upto 2 million people get additional Rs125,000 for each 10,000 increment. This shows that distribution of money under equalisation grants is to an extent rational whereas several other programmes are infamous for doling out money based on recommendation and influence of powerful political leaders and top officials at Singha Durbar.By cutting resources to local units, the government is treading a regressive path by weakening sub-national administrations—at a time it needs to devolve more authorities and resources to strengthen them as per the spirit of the federal system. The local representatives, while speaking during the sit-in at the ministry, accused the authorities of shifting development and other responsibilities to the local units while centralising resources at Singha Durbar. They are right to say that such a tendency will neither strengthen the federal system nor does it sit well with the spirit of the new constitution.  \nIn a breathtaking display of callousness to public health, two weeks into a ban on Indian spice brands Everest and MDH, their products continue to be available in the market, including on various online stores. According to officials at the Department of Food Technology and Quality Control, the public need not panic as the problematic batches of these products have been pulled from the market and their import stopped. Yet anecdotal evidence suggests that most stores never stopped selling these spice brands. Another of the department’s laughable excuses for its failure to examine the collected spice samples is that it lacks necessary chemicals to test for traces of ethylene oxide, which is directly linked to multiple forms of cancer. It was because of the reported presence of this chemical in the products of the two brands—as discovered in food labs in Singapore and Hong Kong—that they had to be banned in Nepal. Because of poor demand following the ban, importers say, very little of these spices is entering Nepal. Yet, here again, there is no evidence to prove that claim. This episode of tainted spices raises some troubling questions. If the country does not have basic chemicals to test for such dangerous substances in food products, how can we be sure that similar products from domestic manufacturers are not poisonous? It’s common knowledge that most tests on food products available in Nepali markets are carried out during the festive time of Dashain and Tihar. Otherwise, at other times, we seldom hear of such tests. This suggests that even the few tests undertaken are for show, and there is no long-term state commitment to ensuring public health. Many urban centres of Nepal are now witnessing dangerous levels of air pollution. Water is scarce in much of the country. Most of the food we consume, from pesticide-laden fruits and vegetables to carcinogen-containing spices, will only worsen our health. Even in general, those with lesser means suffer more adverse health outcomes. Health and food products from around the world are now readily available in our supermarkets. Those with the means can access the more expensive and safer food products while the rest have to rely on the cheapest and often the most tainted food products. Couple this with the ever-increasing healthcare costs in Nepal, and you get a stark difference in the health outcomes between the rich and the poor. One American study found that the greater one’s income, the lower one’s likelihood of disease and premature death, and “Americans at all income levels are less healthy than those with incomes higher than their own.” Another study showed that low income is associated with a poor quality dietary intake. Similar dynamics have been observed wherever such studies have been carried out. A country that cannot ensure a minimum level of standard on the food the masses rely on cannot be called an equitable state. Food security is not just about ensuring people have enough to eat, it is as much about making sure what they eat is safe.    \nAfter months of locking horns in Parliament over Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s alleged involvement in cooperative fraud, the government and the opposition parties have finally agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. This would not have been possible without the persistent calls of opposition parties, led by the Nepali Congress, often at the cost of disrupting the House business. It wouldn’t have been possible either without the solid investigative reporting by the mainstream media, including Kantipur daily, for which the Kantipur Media Group chairperson Kailash Sirohiya had to spend nine days in police custody as a victim of vendetta politics. Now that the committee has been formed, the question is whether it will deliver. The seven-member body is led by Surya Thapa of the CPN-UML, the party that, for the longest period, stood firmly behind Lamichhane, dismissing all calls for the committee. Other committee members are Sarita Bhusal of the UML, Ishwari Neupane and Badri Pandey of the Congress, Lekhnath Dahal of the CPN (Maoist Centre), Shishir Khanal of the Rastriya Swatantra Party and Dhruba Bahadur Pradhan of the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. At a glance, the ruling majority has a clear upper hand in the committee.What is distressing is that the committee’s terms of reference do not include Lamichhane’s name, who is at the eye of the storm in the fraud case. We should not forget that the alleged involvement of a deputy prime minister and home minister in embezzling hundreds of million rupees of common people’s hard-earned savings led to the committee’s formation. The inclusion of Gorkha Media Network, the company where he was managing director and where he allegedly parked the fraudulently acquired money, was the second best option, and the opposition parties were compelled to compromise on this score. Thankfully, the names of a slew of other cooperatives that have come into the radar for fraudulent transactions have been mentioned in the committee’s ToR. The idea, ultimately, is to provide justice to all victims across the country and punish the culprits.The committee members should work earnestly to take the probe to a logical conclusion. Governments and coalitions come and go, in light of how Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal has had to take the vote of confidence four times in less than a year and a half. Fair investigation will be vital for a credible parliamentary probe. Previous probe committees have had a poor record of either failing to investigate properly or sweeping the findings under the rug. The report of the parliamentary probe committee on the caste-killing of Ajit Mijar, for instance, is yet to be published even after eight, long years. The new committee to investigate cooperatives should look to change that image. The investigation should neither be inspired by vendetta against anyone, including Lamichhane, nor by a desire to cleanse his name or those of anyone else found guilty of misappropriating people’s hard-earned money. It is thus vital that the committee, right at the start, builds an environment of trust by committing to a free and fair investigation. This should include open discussions on the matter and clear and consistent communication on the committee’s working and findings. Only then will the hundreds of thousands of victims of cooperative frauds get the justice they seek. \nLawmaker Jivan Pariyar, a joint general secretary of the Nepali Congress, the main opposition, was a member of the four-member taskforce that prepared the terms of reference (ToR) of the parliamentary committee to probe the cooperative scam. The taskforce finalised it after a prolonged dispute over whether to categorically mention Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane’s name while defining the committee’s jurisdiction. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal talked to him about the ToR finalisation process and other aspects of the probe. It took weeks to finalise the ToR and jurisdiction of the parliamentary committee formed to probe the cooperative scam. How did you finally reach an agreement? I will give a brief context first. Cases of cooperative frauds had been made public even in the past. But this time, some groups and gangs were seen to be working in an organised way to embezzle billions of rupees deposited by common people. Some established people, including those active in politics, were found to be misusing the people’s hard-earned money. This issue was thus urgent and our party Nepali Congress raised it strongly in Parliament. We had raised this issue even when we were in the government [before March 4]. We had raised it with erstwhile home minister Narayankaji Shrestha in parliamentary committees and other platforms. We had talked to him about the involvement of lawmakers and other politicians in such scams.But the Congress raised this issue more strongly after the party quit the government.This is true, and for a good reason. We demanded a parliamentary committee to probe this issue after our party’s exit from the government because Rabi Lamichhane, someone linked with some big cooperative scams, became home minister. We raised this issue after he was allowed to lead the same ministry and police agencies that were supposed to be investigating the scams. Earlier, various agencies within Nepal Police and other government bodies were looking into the matter. Erstwhile home minister Shrestha had assured us of an independent and fair investigation. Lamichhane transferred police officials who were investigating the scams, and tried to protect cooperative operators involved in wrongdoing. Based on all these activities, we concluded that a parliamentary probe committee is a must and we firmly stood for the same. Initially, we raised this issue in Parliament without obstructing House proceedings but the government compelled us to disrupt the meetings after it refused to address our concerns. The prime minister tried to give Lamichhane a clean chit by saying that he was not involved in the cooperative scams. Also, the Nepal Police chief at a parliamentary committee meeting said that the home minister wasn’t under investigation as he had done nothing wrong. In the meantime, the attorney general issued a letter stating that no cooperative-related case was registered against Lamichhane. It became clear that the government agencies wouldn’t investigate the issue independently. Then, we raised the issue strongly and we even had to obstruct Parliament meetings. After the pressure, top leaders from the ruling as well as opposition parties agreed to form a parliamentary committee to investigate the matter. The leaders formed a task force led by Law, Justice and Parliamentary Affairs Minister Padam Giri and entrusted us with preparing the committee’s ToR and defining its jurisdiction.But at the task force meetings, members from the ruling parties lobbied to define the committee’s jurisdiction in a way that only allowed for investigation into the wrongdoings of cooperatives and their operators but not those involved in syphoning money from there through illegal means. They argued that only those who issued the loans should be made liable, not those who obtained it. Their intent was to protect Rabi Lamichhane. But I insisted that our duty is to find where the common people’s money has been spent or misused and then to return the money to the depositors. I insisted on investigating Lamichhane as various studies have shown his involvement in the misuse of depositors’ money.Then, we started exchanging written proposals. We exchanged and discussed many such proposals in writing. We insisted on mentioning the names of Lamichhane and the Gorkha Media Network—where Lamichhane and GB Rai invested tens of millions of cooperatives’ money—and ensuring that the depositors get their money back. After a long negotiation, members from the UML became a bit flexible. But the Rastriya Swatantra Party of Lamichhane continued to be rigid. Then, we finally agreed to mention the names of the cooperatives from where Lamichhane and his former colleagues had obtained money and to name Gorkha Media Network but not Lamichhane.But won’t keeping out the name of the sitting home minister create more confusion and disputes?There is no need to be confused. The ToR has stated the name of Gorkha Media Network, where Lamichhane and his team invested the money they got from the cooperatives, and the ToR’s Annex-2 has a list of cooperatives from where they obtained the money. It has also stated that “responsible officials of the company” involved in such transactions would also be investigated. Even other firms and individuals linked to the transactions will be probed. So there is no chance of keeping Lamichhane away from investigation. The committee’s jurisdiction defined in the ToR is clear on this.Will your party ask for Lamichhane’s resignation after the committee starts investigating him?Our party is yet to formally demand the home minister’s resignation. But questions have been raised about him in Parliament, in various public platforms and in the media. Also, the general public has raised this issue. He knows the committee will summon him for interrogation. A few months ago, when a minister [from Congress] was summoned by the Commission for Investigation of Abuse of Authority, Lamichhane was the one who strongly demanded the minister’s resignation in Parliament. He will soon face the parliamentary inquiry committee. Let’s see how he faces it. Leaders from ruling parties including the prime minister have accused the Congress of personally targeting Lamichhane after he refused to join a Congress-led coalition in which he was offered the prime ministerial position.Leaders from new parties should understand that political leaders engage in dialogue with all political forces. Some meetings are convened in a strategic way. This is natural in a democracy. Also, Lamichhane met with our party president. But they spread a rumour that our party president offered him the prime ministerial position. That’s not true. The argument that we targeted him after he refused to join our coalition is baseless. The Congress has officially decided that the probe committee can investigate any of our members suspected of wrongdoings. Has any other party made such a decision officially? We have also officially challenged the home minister to prove the allegations he labelled at our party leaders from Parliament’s rostrum. We have also challenged him to investigate and prove the charges.When the names of head and members of the parliamentary probe committee became public, many thought that the parties didn’t give due importance to the panel as they nominated relatively low-profile lawmakers. Why didn’t the parties choose powerful leaders to investigate a national crisis of this magnitude?This is a wrong perception. All members are federal parliamentarians. They shouldn’t be judged based on their personalities and profiles. The committee is powerful because it has a mandate from the House, and its jurisdiction and the ToR give it power. What we should carefully follow is their work. They can invite experts and specialists—such as chartered accountants, bankers, account specialists—if they require technical expertise during the investigation.Lamichhane himself is chair of the fourth-largest party, which has a decisive role in the ruling coalition. Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli had initially ruled out any need of investigation into the home minister. In this context, can the committee members freely conduct the investigation?I am confident that even the committee member from the RSP can’t defend his leader when the documents and facts show that the money was illegally released. How can other members protect him? I believe they will conduct the investigation independently and come up with a consensus report. Documents, facts and figures guide investigation. This isn’t like leaders giving statements on public platforms. We are not saying he must be proven guilty as the Congress has blamed him. He may prove to be innocent after investigation. We should accept if the evidence proves Lamichhane innocent. The bottom line is that the investigation should be fair. Many Congress leaders are also involved in cooperative scams and other corruption cases. So people suspect that leaders will eventually trade off and the probe panel will be only an eyewash.This investigation cannot be weakened under any pretext. I am saying this based on the documents and evidence I have studied. Also, the media and other stakeholders such as the study report of Pokhara Metropolitan City and the investigation report of Rupandehi District Police, among others, have already made ample evidence public. It’s not easy to acquit the guilty.What will Congress’ approach be if the committee, where ruling parties have a majority, fails to decide by consensus and members take decisions on a majority basis?In the seven-member panel, there are two members from our party and one from the Rastriya Prajatantra Party. If those from the ruling parties pushed for a wrong decision based on their majority, members from opposition parties will counter that and register their differing views. If such a situation arises they will be free to make the reality public and they can even bring out a different report.Was Congress under pressure to reach an agreement as there were reports that the government was preparing to unveil the budget through ordinance citing opposition’s House obstruction?We weren’t worried about that. In fact, the prime minister’s initiatives and his seriousness to end the House deadlock played a crucial role in helping us reach this agreement. \nAmnesty International's Secretary General's visit to Nepal highlighted concerns about backsliding human rights globally, including shrinking civic space, excessive force during protests, impunity, and the erosion of media freedom, emphasizing that peace cannot be sustainable without justice.\nThe CPN (Unified Socialist), established in 2021 after a split from the CPN-UML, prepares for its first general convention, navigating challenges in policy implementation, internal division, and coalition stability.\nThe UN Resident Coordinator in Nepal, Hanaa Singer-Hamdy, highlights Nepal's development progress and discusses its challenges in LDC graduation, SDG achievement, resource mobilization, climate change impacts, peace consolidation, and Nepal's role in UN and international forums.\nThe budget session of Nepal's federal parliament kicks off amidst unresolved differences over a probe committee on cooperative fraud allegations against a key minister, raising uncertainties about the session's productivity and the endorsement of several bills.\nCloudy conditions prevail nationwide with light rain and possible snowfall in some areas, especially in eastern, central, western, and mid-western regions.\nLocal winds brought rainfall to Kathmandu Valley on Tuesday, providing relief from the heat; the monsoon is expected to arrive on June 13.\nPartly to generally cloudy weather with chances of precipitation (rain, thunder, lightning, snowfall) in various regions of Nepal, including gusts of wind in some areas; Nepalgunj recorded the highest temperature (40.2°C) while Jumla recorded the lowest minimum temperature (10.8°C).\nPartly cloudy skies, scattered rainfall in hilly areas, potential thunderstorms, with varying temperatures across Nepal.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
