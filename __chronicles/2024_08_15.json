Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter a decade, the House of Representatives amended the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, allowing non-amnesty for serious human rights violations and ensuring victim-centric transitional justice.\nBechan Jha, a suspect in the Bhutanese refugee scam, faces charges of state fraud, forgery, and cheating as a hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the Kathmandu District Court after his arrest on June 28 and subsequent refusal to take a polygraph test.\nAmidst a surge in COVID cases, Nepal plans to roll out a monovalent vaccine for vulnerable groups, including elderly, immunocompromised, and children, as the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 drives infections with a positivity rate of 13.68%.\nNepal plans to hold a SAARC Council of Ministers meeting on September 26th on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, aiming to revitalize the South Asian regional organization that has been stalled due to India-Pakistan tensions.\nWriter-director Manoj Pandit utilizes literature's insights into human nature and emotions in his films, broadening his perspectives on social and political issues through reading nonfiction and books that blur fiction and reality.\nFollowing a deadly bus accident, the Ministry of Home Affairs recommends GPS tracking, regular inspections, and other measures to improve road safety.\nIt has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.An emergency committee met earlier on Wednesday to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the disease outbreak constitutes a “public health emergency of international concern,” or PHEIC.PHEIC status is WHO’s highest level of alert and aims to accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and cooperation to contain a disease.“It’s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,” said Tedros.Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.“The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighbouring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying,” Tedros added.Tedros said on Wednesday that WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and plans to release more in the coming days. WHO’s response plan would require an initial $15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding.Earlier this week, Africa’s top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths this year, mainly among children in Congo.Professor Dimie Ogoina, chair of WHO’s mpox emergency committee, said all members unanimously agreed that the current upsurge of cases is an “extraordinary event,” with a record number of cases in Congo.Vaccines and behaviour change helped stop the spread when a different strain of mpox spread globally, primarily among men who have sex with men, and WHO declared an emergency in 2022.In Congo, the transmission routes need further study, WHO said. No vaccines are yet available, although efforts are underway to change that and work out who best to target. The agency also appealed to countries with stockpiles to donate shots. \nNepal Oil Corporation has reduced the price of petroleum products, effective from Friday midnight.The corporation has slashed the price of petrol by Rs5 per litre and that of diesel and kerosene by Re3 per litre.As per the new adjusted price, petrol will cost Rs165/litre and diesel and kerosene will cost Rs155/litre in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.In Surkhet and Dang, consumers will have to pay Rs164 for a litre of petrol, while the price of diesel and kerosene will be Rs154 per litre.Likewise, petrol will cost Rs162.5 for a litre in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj while diesel will be 152.5 per litre.In Nepal, under the automatic fuel price mechanism, the corporation sets prices based on the tariff it receives from its sole supplier, the Indian Oil Corporation.The oil monopoly announced that the price of petrol has decreased by Rs5.00 per litre, while diesel and kerosene prices have decreased by Rs3.00 per litre, as per the tariff from the IOC.The price of LP gas and aviation fuel have remained unchanged. \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nSri Lanka’s presidential election, scheduled for September 21, is taking an interesting turn. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP), which initially planned to nominate Ranil Wickramasinghe as the presidential candidate, has now nominated Namal Rajapakse, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapakse. Wickremesinghe was delaying his candidature announcement, giving rise to speculation that he was not interested in becoming the official nominee of SLPP, which would undermine the future of the United National Party (UNP) he heads. SLPP demanded that if Wickremesinghe wants to contest the position, he must resign from the UNP. The problem started after some of his supporters from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) proposed to sideline the Rajapakses. Moreover, Namal Rajapakse opposed Wickremesinghe’s contest from SLPP, forcing the party to reconsider its decision.Yet, Wickremesinghe has garnered support from many SLPP and Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) parliamentarians for his candidature. He has decided to contest as an independent candidate, stating that a non-party, common candidate is the need of the hour. He expects people to vote based on his performance in the last two years. The Freedom People’s Congress (FPC), a breakaway faction of SLPP, has decided to join the SJB, while another faction joined the UNP headed by Wickremesinghe. One is witnessing several permutations and combinations. At the first Ekwa Jayagamu (Victory through Unity) rally in Matara, the President called on other parties to put their personal agendas aside and work for the country. The presidential frayApart from the sitting president Wickremesinghe, who the SLPP supports at present, and Namal, the party’s official candidate in this election, Sajith Premadasa—son of former President of Sri Lanka Ranasinghe Premadasa of SJB—and Anura Kamara Dissanayake, also known as AKD of National People’s Power (NPP)—the new avatar of JVP with its notorious violent past—are also contesting. Both had contested the last presidential election and lost to Gotabaya Rajapakse. Sajith had broken away from the UNP and formed the SJB with others after having serious differences with Ranil Wickremesinghe. But Wickremesinghe benefited from the 2022 Jana Aragalaya (people’s movement). Wickremesinghe, who was the prime minister, took over as President after Gotabaya was forced to quit. Other actorsThe Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) established by the Bandaranaike family is faction-ridden, with three leaders claiming party presidency, and one faction has extended support to Sajith Premadasa. P Ariyanethiran is a Tamil candidate representing the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchchi (ITAK), part of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). After the death of the TNA supremo, it is ridden with factionalism. The Tamils have previously voted for major political parties in the presidential election. They form a crucial vote bank that can determine the outcome of the September election, as seen in the past. Many attribute the LTTE’s boycott of the 2004 election contributed to the victory of Mahinda Rajapakse.Campaign strategiesWickramasinghe’s campaigning strategy is based on Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. According to the World Bank, it is on the road to recovery, even though it considers debt restructuring inadequate and emphasises structural reforms. He wants to capitalise on this. In May, the Sri Lankan government introduced three Bills—the Economic Transformation Bill, the Public Debt Management Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill, which faced significant opposition from the SJB and the NPP. The government’s effort has been debt restructuring to utilise valuable foreign currency for economic development and attract investment. Wickramasinghe has asked all the political forces to join and, interestingly, has offered Sajith restoration of his UNP membership if he cooperates. Wickremesinghe is going to address his second rally on August 17 in Anuradhapura. His supporters, drawn from several political parties, want to form a new front to support his election. A main advantage for him is that he came to lead the country at a time when others, especially SJB’s Sajith—who came second in the 2019 Presidential election—were not prepared to take responsibility. Wickramasinghe, in his first Anuradhapura rally in July, also said that Sri Lanka’s GDP is $85 million, which should be increased to $350 million by 2028. Whether he will receive the support of the minorities is yet to be seen.Sajith Premadasa had lost the election to Gotabaya in 2019. Yet, unlike R Premadasa, he is not a charismatic leader who keeps ears to the ground. The SJB, which has formed a coalition of seven parties, will fight the election under the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) platform. Sajith has promised to continue with the IMF reforms to bring the economy back on track. The party has prioritised anti-corruption as its main plank. It is looking for the support of the minorities and has been able to enlist the support of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) headed by Mano Ganesan, who represents Malaiyaha Tamils spread across the Central, Southern and Western provinces and that of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.The left-leaning NPP (formerly JVP) is a strong contender in this presidential election. Its leader, Anura Kumara Bandaranaike, has visited India and other Western countries to ally the fear of these countries, given JVP’s violent past and its anti-India and anti-Western stances in the past. JVP’s leader Bandaranaike is leading in various opinion polls. In recent rallies, he has drawn massive crowds with his slogan of ushering in a ‘new renaissance’. His promises include political and economic reforms.Among all these candidates, Namal Rajapakse bears the burden of everything that has gone wrong with Sri Lanka recently. Namal has previously been a sports minister and thus has political experience. The removal of his uncle Gotabaya Rajapakse and the alleged corruption his family was involved in are still etched in people’s minds. Namal may not find an easy way, and the opinion poll puts him in a distant third.Difficult choiceWith political fragmentation across all the political parties except for the NPP, it would be difficult for voters to choose. Wickremesinghe stood a good chance and perhaps could have pulled through with the support of the SLPP and his performance in the last two years. But the NPP appears stronger and more focussed, and has a clear vision for the country. Unlike other political parties, it is not tried and tested. Its violent past and radical left ideology perhaps would not help the IMF reform plans on which Sri Lanka depends. Holding a position of power may help Anura Kamara Dissanayake to moderate his stance on economic recovery and the unemployment problem and to secure the rights of the working class. \nMahpara's decision to put her career before raising a child was strongly disapproved by her in-laws, relatives, and maternal family. On the other hand, Shanaya, who wanted to devote herself to her home responsibilities, endured ridicule from her friends and acquaintances, who said she was wasting her years of education. Both did not receive the support they needed, though they wanted to take charge of their own life by coming to their own conclusions. From these two scenarios, the question that comes to my mind is: do we really practice empowering women? Or is it only a catchphrase used in corporate-sponsored social events?Research and surveys indicate that gender parity in Bangladesh has improved in all areas due to women's increased participation in socio-economic and political activities. In recent years, Bangladesh has witnessed significant advancements in women's empowerment, resulting in noteworthy societal transformations. Unfortunately, the concept of women's empowerment is often construed narrowly in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world, linking it mainly to women's employment outside the home or in official workplaces. A limited perspective cannot do justice to the diversity of women's experiences and the multitude of ways that empowerment can manifest itself.Despite enormous progress toward gender equality and women's rights, common misconceptions often associate women's empowerment with working for a living. On the other hand, those who opt to devote themselves to household responsibilities, receive less respect. However, there are five distinct categories of women's empowerment: social, educational, political, economic, and psychological. Unfortunately, the general perspective overlooks the essential contributions made by women in a wide range of sectors, including but not limited to childcare and house management. The realisation that women's empowerment entails more than merely engaging only in external workplaces emphasises the need for a clear and established definition of empowerment.True empowerment is built on empowering women to make life decisions free from outside pressures like discrimination, constraints, or societal standards. Women should have the freedom to pursue their interests and ambitions, regardless of whether that coincide with conventional gender stereotypes. Regardless of the route women choose, empowering them requires acknowledging and appreciating their efforts. This can involve dedicating oneself to domestic duties and family obligations or pursuing a career or engaging in both. Women will gain personally from having the autonomy to make their own decisions, as will their families and society at large. Therefore, we must acknowledge that while it is common for women to choose to work outside, it is also acceptable for other women not to make that decision. No one should have to cope with negative societal reactions from people making critical comments about them.Bangladeshi women face a range of challenges as they balance the complex interactions between work and home responsibilities. The strain to balance work and home responsibilities to live up to the social expectations of women's empowerment frequently hurts women's welfare and exacerbates gender inequity. According to studies, women who juggle two or more roles have higher levels of stress, burnout, and mental health issues. All of these take place in the name of women's empowerment, which is mostly promoted on social media. The slogans \"perfect women can balance both career and home\" and \"mothers are humans with supernatural powers\" have unexpectedly gained popularity. Why is possessing superhuman abilities a prerequisite for being a good mother?We really should try to reframe the idea of women's empowerment. To enhance it, we need activism, education, and information that questions established social norms and fosters an inclusive society that honours women's choices. An effort should be made to create supportive settings that enable women to make informed and autonomous decisions about their lives, rather than unjustifiably pressuring them to go above and beyond what is expected of them at home and at work. This means challenging ingrained social conventions that uphold the notion of \"having it all\" and promoting policies and legislation that encourage fair distribution of caregiving duties, accommodating work hours, and a positive work-life balance. Research-based mediation can play a significant role in reducing barriers that obstruct the real relevance of women's empowerment. In addition, it is critical that individuals, groups, and communities actively support women in their pursuit of self-determination and autonomy.In Bangladesh, redefining women's empowerment will require a comprehensive plan and a fundamental shift in public perception. One that acknowledges the complexity of women's lives. One that goes beyond restrictive categories and acknowledges the diversity of women's experiences and aspirations. In order to build a more equitable and inclusive society where all women can thrive and contribute positively, women's choices should be prioritised.Women's empowerment should be more than just a buzzword; it needs to be a reality demonstrated by freedom, dignity, and true choice.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nBrands and Beyond 2024, an event to bring together marketing and branding professionals to discuss the latest industry trends and innovations, kicked off in Kathmandu, Nepal on Thursday.The event will feature a distinguished lineup of speakers from Nepal and abroad, the organisers said.Among the speakers are Karpat Polat, creative chairman at K A R P A T, Guan Hin Tay, creative chairman at BBDO Singapore, Cristiano Tonnarelli, a creative powerhouse with 14 Cannes Lions, Rajeev R Menon, chief executive creative officer at Ogilvy, Shubho Sengupta, digital marketer and head of communications at Karmayogi Bharat, Prathap Suthan, chief creative officer at Bang in the Middle, known for the iconic 'India Shining' and 'Incredible India' campaigns.The event taking place at the Yak and Yeti Hotel in Kathmandu is partnered by Kantipur TV, Kantipur Publications, Kantipur Radio, and The Kathmandu Post. The Brandguff has organised this two-day programme.The event will feature masterclasses, interactive sessions, and networking opportunities, aiming to foster innovation and excellence in marketing practices, the organisers said. \nThailand's governing alliance agreed on Thursday to back 37-year-old political newcomer Paetongtarn Shinawatra as its candidate for prime minister, a day ahead of a pivotal vote in parliament.The deal follows a flurry of behind-the-scenes talks in the 24 hours since a court dismissed Srettha Thavisin as premier, as his Pheu Thai Party rushed to secure backing from its 11-party alliance in a bid to form the next government.Paetongtarn is the daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra, and a niece of Yingluck Shinawatra, both former premiers who fled into exile after military coups against their governments.Wednesday's dismissal of Srettha by the Constitutional Court was the latest hammer blow for Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family that has locked horns for two decades with Thailand's influential establishment and royalist military.If successful in Friday's vote, Paetongtarn would be Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to hold the top post.\"We were confident that under her leadership, we will all support her and be ready to carry out her policies from the day she assumes office,\" Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, told a press conference to announce Paetongtarn as candidate.Srettha was the movement's fourth premier to be removed by a court ruling and his downfall could indicate the end of an uneasy detente between Thaksin and his enemies in the conservative elite and military old guard, which had enabled the tycoon's return from self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.The 11-party alliance holds 314 seats in the house, of which 141 belong to Pheu Thai, and should have no difficulty electing a prime minister on Friday, providing it remains intact.To become premier a candidate needs the approval of more than half of the current 493 lawmakers. \nThousands of women marched across several Indian cities overnight and Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for strict punishment for crimes against women, as outrage and protests against the gruesome rape and murder of a doctor escalated.Holding candles and posters that said “reclaim the night”, women held marches across cities, including the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, where the rape and murder of a trainee doctor last week has triggered protests by fellow medics, demanding better and safer working conditions.Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice for the victim.The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.“As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage,” Modi said in an address to the nation on its 78th Independence Day on Thursday.The rape has revived memories of a similar case in New Delhi in 2012, when a gang of men raped and severely injured a 23-year-old student in a moving Delhi bus, leading eventually to her death.“This horrific incident has once again reminded us that women disproportionately bear the weight of ensuring their own safety,” Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt said in a post on her Instagram page, which has more than 85 million followers.Doctors in India’s crowded and often squalid government hospitals have long complained of being overworked and underpaid, and say not enough is done to curb violence levelled at them by people angered over the medical care on offer.Crimes against women in India rose 4% in 2022 from the previous year, data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), released late last year, showed. \nPatan High Court Judge Rameshwar Regmi passed away on Wednesday. He was 61.Regmi breathed his last while receiving treatment at the Nepal Cancer Hospital in Harisiddhi, Lalitpur.According to Raju Shrestha, the office secretary at the Judges’ Society, Nepal, Regmi was undergoing treatment for a brain tumour.He will be cremated at the Pashupati Aryaghat today.Regmi was appointed as a high court judge in 2020 and posted to Janakpur while he was a registrar at Patan High Court, Hetauda bench. He was later transferred to Patan High Court, Lalitpur. \nGenerally cloudy conditions will prevail across the country on Thursday, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is expected at various locations in all provinces.Tonight, the cloudiness will continue nationwide, with light to moderate rain and thunder and lightning likely to persist in several areas.There is a chance of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.The entire country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough situated near the average position.On Wednesday, the highest maximum temperature recorded was 36.4°C in Janakpur, while the lowest minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. The highest 24-hour rainfall was 45.7 mm in Simara. \nIn August 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Pashupatinath Temple, a significant temple of the Hindu god Shiva.In May 2018, he visited Janakpur, the famous Hindu pilgrimage site. In May 2022, he visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha.His visit drew thousands of Indian visitors, particularly for pilgrimage purposes.Nepal has been a centre for Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims. It is considered the dwelling place of Lord Shiva and the birthplace of Buddha and Goddess Sita. A fraction of tourists visit Nepal for religious purposes, but Nepal has never realised the potential of spiritual products that have not been branded, marketed, and promoted.Various studies have shown that religion has become a niche product in a society overrun by commercial clutter, and it could boost the economy.Now, two brothers in Janakpur, in Nepal’s southern plain, the birthplace of Sita, have devised a unique project: The construction of Janak Dham.“The work has already started. The Dham will be spread over 22 bigas (148,998 square meters) in Chhireshwarnath Municipality-8, Dhanusha,” said Kausalendra Jha, a chartered accountant.“The project costs Rs2 billion, and it looks like a palace of King Janak. The five-year project plans to produce, promote and market religious goods and services, the first of its kind in Nepal,” said Kausalendra, who has his brother Ragvendra Jha, a hotel entrepreneur, as his investment partner.Currently, 100 cows are kept in Janak Dham. The Jha brothers plan to commercially sell more than a dozen products made from cow’s milk, including urine and dung.Under the project, agriculture and industry based on cows will be built, an Ayurveda and natural hospital, a meditation and Janak Darshan Centre, a convention hall with the capacity for 1,000 people, a resort, a children's park, and an audio-video hall will be established.Pilgrimage tourism has a higher scope in Nepal. Since Nepal has become a key gateway for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in Tibet, China, developing and marketing religious products could primarily benefit the local economy. Annually, 40,000 to 50,000 Indians visited Tibet using Nepal’s route before the Covid-19 pandemic. Lumbini used to host nearly 1.5 million visitors, including Nepalis, before the Covid and is now gradually recovering. In 2023, about 1.2 million people visited Lumbini, especially with a significant influx of 70,000 Indian tourists. Annually, millions visit Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.“We also plan to sell the products through our outlets in Sankhamul, Kathmandu and Janaki temple, Janakpur,” said Kausalendra.The construction of Janak Dham is expected to be over in five phases. The first phase has almost been completed, and cow-based agriculture and industry have already started. Preparations are ready to introduce 12 products of Janak Dham to the markets of Kathmandu and Janakpur in the first phase. Kausalendra said buttermilk, takrarishta, a traditional Ayurvedic fermented buttermilk, and five varieties of ghee, including one that can be put in the nose, will be produced.Similarly, the Dham will produce colostrum, sugar-free sweets, paneer, incense sticks, gomutra ark, a distilled form of cow urine and punarnava ark, an Ayurvedic medicine used in the treatment of jaundice, anaemia, abdominal diseases, diabetes and bleeding disorders.It will also produce organic fertiliser, jackfruit flour, kolhu edible oil, and food grains prepared traditionally. “All our products are made with cow’s milk, urine and dung. Made from A2 milk, which contains lactose and is chock-full of key nutrients like protein and calcium, all our production has Ayurvedic characteristics,” said Kausalendra.He said that as the production of Janak Dham is limited, it is currently targeted at two cities.The Dham started with 100 cows of different breeds, such as hariyana, sahibal, gir, and achhami, and plans to increase the number of cows by 400.“Madhesh is the foodgrain basket. However, the application of toxic pesticides has been impacting people’s health. The food grains nurtured by cow dung fertiliser are healthy,” Kausalendra said.The farmer of Digambarpur, where the Dham is located, has started using organic manure.Kausalendra, who worked for a long time in agriculture projects under the World Bank, said they decided to change their lifestyle during the Covid-19 period. So, the Jha brothers decided during a coronavirus lockdown to make Janak Dham.“We do not need to bring raw material from other places to produce our goods. Everything is produced here,” they said. “We plan to introduce our products to the elite class in the initial phase. The production will be increased based on the demand.” \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nParticipants at an interaction programme have stressed cybersecurity education and awareness alongside developing a robust and practical policy framework to address the growing cyber threats and gaps in existing regulations.At the programme organised by the Information Security Response Team Nepal (npCert), in collaboration with the Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CSR) and Texas College of Management and IT, Rajib Subba, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police, advocated for enhancing educational programmes with a focus on practical skill development to prepare the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.Likewise, Ganesh Ghimire, a FinTech expert, provided an in-depth analysis of the prospects and challenges of cross-border transactions in Nepal.He highlighted the vulnerabilities in international financial dealings and called for strengthened security measures to protect these transactions.Also speaking, Resham Bhandari, representing InfoDevelopers, stressed the importance of cyber literacy at the grassroots level. He argued that raising awareness and understanding of cyber threats among the general population is essential for creating a secure digital environment.Likewise, Chiranjibi Adhikari, president of npCert, emphasised the pressing need for a comprehensive National Cybersecurity Policy.Adhikari underscored the importance of fortifying Nepal's digital infrastructure to safeguard against rising cyber threats, highlighting the necessity of a strong policy framework to protect the nation's digital assets and ensure long-term resilience.Sharad Chandra Pyakurel, Birendra Singh Dhami, Suman Thapaliya and Dhurba Raj Sharma, general secretary of npCert, also highlighted the importance of bridging the gap between policy formulation and implementation to ensure effective execution and adaptability to emerging cyber challenges. \nThe bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act has landed in the House of Representatives amid mixed reactions from the victims and human rights activists.Bimala Subedi, chairperson of the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee of the House, presented a report on the bill that was endorsed by her panel a week earlier. The committee had endorsed the bill unanimously on August 8 after considering it for over a year.The bill will see a detailed discussion on Wednesday before it is put to a vote. As the three major parties unanimously passed the bill in the House committee, there is no barrier to its endorsement from the federal parliament. However, not every stakeholder has accepted it. While hailing the bill as progressive, the Conflict Victims Women National (CVWN) Network has expressed its reservations over the classification of crimes, the proposed provision of reduced sentencing and not listing war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeating such acts. “Narrowing down the definition of serious violations of the human rights poses risk that the victims can be deprived of the rights to truth, justice and reparations,” reads a statement from the CVWN.However, another group of victims united under victims and survivors of serious human rights violations have welcomed the bills saying the agreement in the bill has generated hope for justice. They, however, have demanded their participation in the mechanisms for finalising the reparations. Now the focus of the victims should be towards ensuring that the two transitional justice commissions get the right persons to lead them.However, the Accountability Watch Committee, a rights group, has demanded the authorities concerned address serious errors in the bill before it is endorsed by the federal parliament.All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement. The rights group has expressed its reservations about the provision as well.Those who have followed the process closely say there is no denying that the present bill is progressive and three parties coming together has given a positive message for its conclusion.“Now how honest the parties are towards concluding the process will be seen through what type of people get appointed to the commissions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, assistant professor of Conflict, Peace, and Development Studies at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post. “If competent persons with higher social acceptance get to the position, they can take the process ahead finding pragmatic ways.” \nAmidst the ongoing Maoist Centre (CPN) standing committee meeting, party leaders have demanded a leadership change, challenging Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal's control and questioning the efficacy of current policies.\nThe Nepali Congress dissidents demand a timely 15th general convention in December 2023, criticizing the party leadership's history of delaying conventions and demanding adherence to the charter's four-year cycle.\nIndia's new Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Nepal for familiarization, meeting with President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and other leaders to discuss bilateral relations, hydropower development, climate change minimization, and a possible visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nKathmandu prohibits construction within 40 meters of riverbanks, with a 20-meter extension, and mandates water conservation and legal action for violations.\nAfter a century-long absence caused by the 1934 earthquake, the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance is being revived in Bhaktapur ahead of Indra Jatra, thanks to the efforts of young dancers trained by experienced Newari arts teachers.\nLions Club of Kathmandu honored individuals and businesses for their societal contributions, including Prateek Pradhan for journalism, Erika Gurung for sports, and Ramesh Corporation for corporate responsibility.\nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \n All Ncell numbers and customers can receive one-time passwords (OTPs), short message services (SMSes), and other notifications, irrespective of shortcodes or service providers. This is especially important for the renowned government bodies that require customer numbers as part of their KYC requirements or maintain customer databases to ensure efficient and timely communication about their services/important notices, etc., to Nepali citizens.As the use of digital services continues to grow, customers often receive Application to Person (A2P) messages such as OTPs, SMS, and notifications from various service providers, including government bodies, semi-government agencies, banks and financial institutions (BFIs), private sector organizations, and global platforms like Google and Facebook. “We have no issues with A2P messages or notifications delivery in any number range. The increasing flow of A2P messages every year is a positive indicator of the growing digitalization, ensuring that our end users remain Always On,” said Umair Mohsin, Chief Commercial Officer of Ncell. “Some initial issues were observed with our 970 number range; however, we re-iterate that those have already been resolved with prompt understanding from various major service providers.” Clarifying misconceptions about SMSes, OPTs, and notifications delivery, Ncell stated that all Ncell mobile numbers are eligible to receive such messages within the country and outside on international roaming. The company also urged other short-code owners and service providers to include the new 970 number range in their system. Ncell began issuing new mobile numbers starting with this new number range last year to better serve its customers.  \nMonths passed, several promises were made, and finally, the government changed. For months, dairy farmers have been waiting for the government to make both state-owned and private dairies liable to pay their dues. Since December, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation and private dairies have not paid farmers, and according to rough estimates by the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal, a group of farmers, the dues have now piled up to Rs6.5 billion. Most farmers pay their children’s school fees, hospital bills, and food bills with their income from selling milk. Some of their earnings go to buying animal fodder.“The government changed, but the issues have not been resolved,” said Ganesh Chandra Timilsina, coordinator of the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal. “Farmers will make a last-ditch effort now. They will hit the streets.”“The total dues now amount to Rs6.5 billion, even after farmers have received partial payment.”Farmers are holding a meeting on August 19 to announce various protest programmes. “Since it’s a new government, we decided to wait if it could address our grievances,” said Timilsina.The issue has been raised in Parliament, too. On Tuesday, lawmaker Gagan Thapa said the government would soon release Rs600 million to the DDC to pay the farmers. Thapa’s party, Nepali Congress, is the biggest partner in the KP Sharma Oli-led coalition.“It’s a good beginning for the new government. But the government should also realise that problems will recur, particularly in the dairy sector,” Thapa told the House of Representatives.He said that the Agriculture and Industry ministers should discuss exporting milk to Bangladesh and China. If Nepal is able to export milk to these countries, farmers can get better prices.Ramnath Adhikari, minister for agriculture and livestock development, has asked the farmers’ group to wait for 10–15 days more. The farmers' group met with the agriculture minister last Friday. “We don’t have much hope from the minister as well,” said Timilsina, adding that they have received lofty promises from several governments, but their issues remain unresolved.Former agriculture minister Jwala Kumari Sah, too, had promised to address the issue.The private dairy associations say their dues to farmers have reached over Rs2 billion.Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association, said they (private dairy) owe Rs2 billion to the farmers. “There are rumours in the market that we owe farmers Rs4.5 billion. It’s not true.”“We have been paying the farmers partially.”He said that the demand for dairy products has grown. “We are not able to pay farmers the whole sum. We are gradually clearing their dues,” said Dahal.“As big dairies fail to pay the farmers, the amount has become bigger.”On March 4, three private dairy associations—Central Dairy Cooperatives Association, Nepal Dairy Association, and Dairy Industry Association—the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development had signed a trilateral agreement to pay farmers' their dues by April 3.Dairy farmers, however, said there were no representatives from their side during its signing.However, the government failed to commit to requiring the dairy associations to pay the farmers' dues.According to the dairy association, the state-owned dairy supplier covers 30 percent of Nepal’s dairy market, and the rest is catered by private dairies. Private dairies have around 2,000 tonnes of butter in stock. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of milk, valued at Rs90 million, arrives in the market daily across the country through private and state-owned diaries.The informal milk trade—from farmers to customers—is even bigger.Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the Dairy Development Corporation, said that the corporation has 750 tonnes of butter and 850 tonnes of powdered milk in stock.“We requested a loan of Rs600 million with the agriculture ministry a few months ago, but we have not received it yet. We have heard that it is still being processed,” said Paudel, adding that the corporation was doing its best to clear farmers' dues by taking loans.In February, the corporation sought a bailout fund from the finance ministry. Subsequently, in March, the government decided to provide the credit.The corporation earlier said that due to the economic slowdown, consumption of dairy products has dropped sharply, putting them in a difficult situation.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs more than half the population. The share of the dairy sector in the agricultural GDP is 8 percent. \nThe DIGI Nepal Fintech Challenge, a part of the Digital innovation for growth and inclusion in Nepal (DIGI Nepal), has been launched in Nepal.A Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) programme implemented by True North Associates (TNA) in Nepal, the initiative aims to promote digital innovation within Nepal’s fintech sector.Under this programme, five applicants will be selected to join the programme’s accelerator, which offers funded technical assistance to help participants refine their business models and products, the organisers said.The accelerator also offers hands-on business model and product refinement workshops, mentorship, networking opportunities with investors and industry stakeholders, and potential access to Swiss experts, according to the organisers.The deadline for application is August 31 and the application form is available at www.tna.com.np/fintechchallenge, the TNA said. \nVijaya Motors, the sole distributor for Subaru Corporation, Japan, has unveiled two new variants—the Subaru 2.0 Crosstrek Hybrid EyeSight® and the 2.5 Outback Touring EyeSight®.

The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nAlthough the extent of coronavirus spread in communities remains unclear, neither health authorities nor the public see a need for more testing. But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” \nAt the Dhulikhel Hospital in Kavrepalanchok, the suggestion box is overflowing with complaints of rude behaviour.People are unhappy not only with doctors, nurses and paramedics serving at the hospital, but also with security guards, administrative staff and those manning the hospital’s ticket counter.“Sometimes, the behaviour of health workers and other staffers towards patients and their visitors escalates and leads to conflicts,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, administrative head of the Hospital. “The issue is not just the complaints made by the patients and their visitors, hospital officials have also noticed behavioural problems among health workers and other staffers.”To address growing complaints from patients and visitors, the hospital administration has decided to impart behavioural and communication skills training to its entire staffers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and others.Officials hope this training will help lessen the growing grievances.“Proper communication and good behaviour are essential for all hospital staff including doctors,” said Dr Karmacharya. “These skills are also taught in universities and medical courses, but it seems some health workers have not paid much attention to these basics. Patients and their visitors should be treated like a hotel treats its guests.”Experts say complaints about rude behaviour are not only limited to any particular hospital but are prevalent across almost all hospitals in Nepal. Due to a lack of proper communication and behavioural skills, reports of scuffles between hospitals or doctors and the relatives of deceased patients take place frequently. Sometimes, these situations also take a nasty turn and doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised. These disputes have also escalated into shutdown of the healthcare facilities, protests by health workers, and a halt in services.“Colleges under the Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine teach communication skills to the students of medicine,” said Dr Jagdish Prasad Agrawal, retired dean of the Institute of Medicine. “Although communication skills are part of the curriculum and a basic requirement for any health professional, it seems that many have not paid much attention to these skills.”Good communication skills and respectful behaviour are crucial for health workers, regardless of their other profession skills, officials at the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, said.They said that health workers can foster a positive environment in hospitals and improve interactions with patients and their relatives. “People in every profession need good communication skills, and those serving in the medical sector need them the most,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, member of the Council. “The Council often receives complaints about doctors’ rude behaviour.”The council has made professional development training that includes communication skills mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will lead to non-renewal of the medical licence.As per the council’s rule, medical doctors must undertake this training regularly. The council assesses the effectiveness of the training every five years to ensure that medical doctors are up-to-date in their profession.Patients have to wait in long queues in state-run health facilities to see a doctor. Visitors of every patient expect immediate care, as they think that the problems of their patients are more serious than others’. Dawadi said that the success of health workers depends not only on the care they provide but also on their communication with patients.“To lessen risk of getting assaulted or mistreated by patients and their visitors, health workers, including doctors, must be good communicators,” said Dawadi. “Other hospitals should also provide communication and behaviour training to their staff.” \nNearly 60 percent of drinking water samples collected from various places of Lalitpur district—Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Godawari and Mahalaxmi municipalities—are found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that drinking water samples were collected from the local units following an outbreak of cholera in recent weeks.“Out of 12 samples of drinking water collected for quality checks, faecal coliform was found in seven,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Lalitpur health office. “We have started chlorinating drinking water at the sources and have taken other measures to prevent further spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or in their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform indicates that the drinking water being used by the residents of Thaiba in Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.Of the 30 cholera cases reported from across the country, 19 were from various areas of Lalitpur and the remaining from Kailali (8), Kathmandu (1) and Pyuthan (2).Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and or even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As the monsoon is an epidemic season, when most drinking water sources become contaminated due to flooding, presence of deadly microbes—E coli and faecal coliform—in drinking water is not unusual, health officials say. Even jar water, which is generally considered safer compared to water from other sources, often gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns officials most is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Officials at the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) said that it is the responsibility of consumers themselves to ensure that water is safe before drinking, as the utility cannot guarantee the safety of drinking from every tap.“We request consumers to boil water properly before drinking, as water gets contaminated during the monsoon season due to leakage in pipes and mixing of drainage and rainwater,” said Sailaja Acharya, assistant manager of the KUKL. “We have increased the level of chlorine at the treatment plant and in reservoirs, but water could get contaminated when it reaches household taps.”The KUKL has started supplying water from the Bagmati river to household taps after supply from the Melamchi River was halted. Officials said that water from the Bagmati River gets chlorinated before being supplied to household taps. Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal Sports Journalists Forum (NSJF) on Wednesday announced that the 21st edition of the NSJF Pulsar Sports Award will be held on September 13 at the Nepal Academy Hall in Kathmandu.Organising a press conference, NSJF extended the sponsorship deal with main sponsor Golchha Group for yet another year.This is the 16th edition in a row that Golchha Group has been sponsoring the annual Sports Award, which began in 2003.NSJF President Durga Nath Subedi (Devendra) and Golchha Group Director Abhimanyu Golchha penned the sponsorship deal on Wednesday.As per the agreement, Golchha Group will provide N Series’ Pulsar NS 400 two-wheeler, which the Golchha group is launching in Nepal soon, to one award winner, while four NS 200 two-wheelers will be awarded to four others winners.Golchha Group will also provide Rs1.2 million to the NSJF, the umbrella organisation of sports journalists in the country.“Pulsar motorcycles align with the speed, capability, and spirit of athletes,” Director Golchha said. “We are confident that the recognition we have extended to the players has significantly contributed to the advancement of the sports sector.”According to the organisers, the NSJF will also host the Congress of the Asian Sports Journalists Federation (AIPS Asia) in conjunction with the Awards ceremony. The Congress is scheduled to take place from September 10 to 13, with participation from sports journalists representing 33 Asian countries. The NSJF is an active member of the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Asia.“Journalists from across Asia will have the opportunity to witness this prestigious award ceremony this year,” remarked President Subedi.This year, NSJF will recognise athletes and sports professionals in ten categories—Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Team of the Year, People's Choice Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Para Athlete Honour, Special Award, and the Asian Sports Journalist Award.Winners in the Male Player, Female Player, Youth Player, Coach of the Year, and People's Choice Award categories will receive motorcycles. The winners of the Team of the Year Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Special Award, and Para Athlete Honor will be awarded Rs100,000 each.The prize money has been doubled this year, according to NSJF General Secretary Prajwal Oli.Athletes Dipak Adhikari (male), Rajpura Pachhai (female), Dev Kumar Khanal (youth), and Athletics’ Chandra Bahadur Gurung (coach) and Sikka Suwal Shrestha (table tennis) were the winners in the respective category last year. Also, photojournalist Sudarshan Ranjit bagged the special award, Maiya Bisunkhe earned the para-athlete honour, Olympian and former weightlifter Rajendra Kumar Pradhan received Lifetime Achievement award and Chinese sports journalist Cheu Chan Fai was feted with Asian Sports Journalist Award. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nMartyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United failed to progress to the group stage of the AFC Challenge League after they lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC 2-1 in the qualification playoff at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Tuesday.The country’s only international-standard stadium was hosting an international match only days after the Asian Football Confederation deemed it fit for tournaments. Nepal’s national team were forced to move their home matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifications second round to away and neutral venues in March after AFC called the stadium substandard.The build up to Tuesday's playoff clash was also marred by Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s comments “this is like a joke?” when he and his team witnessed ground staff mowing the grass on the Bhadrakali football ground, where they were supposed to practice.The 38-year-old Honda played for Japan’s national team at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cups. He also played for Serie A team AC Milan during the 2014-2017 seasons.But the poor management of the stadium was clearly exposed to the outside world when the day’s rainfall turned the stadium into a muddy and slippery pitch, where players of both sides struggled to get the ball rolling.Honda and almost all the players in the ground were covered in mud only minutes into the first half.Despite the poorly maintained ground, Paro came from behind to outsmart Church Boys, thanks to Kinga Wangchu’s first-half equaliser and William Opoku Asiedu’s winner after the break.It was Paro’s first ever victory in the continental competition in three attempts (in 2020, 2022, 2023/24). They were defeated by Machhindra Club in the preliminary round of the AFC Cup in Kathmandu last year. Church Boys were also competing in the AFC’s tournament for the first time after winning the A-Division League title in their debut season in 2023.Coach Bal Gopal Maharjan started seven national team regulars against the Bhutanese side, who had recruited 11 foreign players for Tuesday’s battle. Honda, who joined Paro on a one match contract, was playing his first competitive match since 2021 and made his presence felt after the hour-mark when his deftly taken low freekick pierced the Church Boys defence and rattled the upright.But, roared by a jam-packed stadium, Church Boys took the lead in the 39th minute when Moses Gyabaah Twum perfectly laid a cross from Arik Bista for Laken Limbu to tap home.The celebrations of the hosts were short-lived as Wangchu, who was surprisingly left unmarked, took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Deep Karki and slotted the ball into the empty net.Church Boys looked more aggressive after the restart and kept flirting with Paro goalkeeper Milos Cupic, with Anjan Bista testing the netkeeper in the 47th minute and Sanish Shrestha’s lofted shot from outside the box almost beating him ten minutes later.But Paro silenced the crowd when Ghanian Opoku, who has also featured for Nepal Super League club Birgunj United and A-Division club Satdobato Youth Club, pounced on a dreadful defending from Omolaja Kareem and completed a remarkable comeback by slamming the bottom corner.Church Boys desperately searched for an equaliser in the final moments and Twum was able to break into a tight Paro defence but could not revive the hopes of Church Boys to reach the main event of the third-tier Asian competition in their debut season. \nThe Nepali national cricket team has commenced a two-week training programme at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, India. The Academy is owned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) expressed its appreciation to Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI, in a Facebook post for his support of the initiative. CAN also extended its thanks to the Indian cricket governing body for facilitating the tour of the Academy.CAN looks forward to strengthening this partnership to explore future cricket tours and opportunities for growth as a cricketing nation, it said in the post.The cricket team has departed for India to sharpen their skills in preparation for the CWC League 2.“#Rhinos are off to India to gear up for the ICC Men's Cricket World Cup League 2 Preparation Series! Training at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bangalore for two weeks will sharpen our players' skills and strategies,” CAN said in a post.Nepal will play its second Cricket World Cup League 2 series against Oman and Canada in Canada this September. Earlier this year, Nepal participated in a tri-series at home against Namibia and the Netherlands, winning only one match. \nThailand's Prime Minister Srettha was removed by the Constitutional Court for appointing a minister with a criminal past, raising political uncertainty and potentially shaking up the governing alliance.\nFormer Bangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina calls for action against those responsible for deaths and vandalism during protests that forced her to flee to India, as a court orders a probe into her role in the death of a grocer during the protests.\nJuddha Shumsher Rana's Jawalakhel Zoological Garden housed a diverse collection of animals and birds, including elephants, deer, tigers, rhinoceros, clouded leopards, red pandas, bears, Himalayan gorals, pheasants, and Himalayan monals, as well as exotic species like peacocks, pigeons, crocodiles, porcupines, and the king of the jungle—a lion.\nDespite legal protections, Nepal's book market is flooded with unauthorized translations of works by renowned international authors, harming both creators and readers while tarnishing the country's reputation as a hub for intellectual property.\nThe ancient Indus Valley Civilization evolved into India, gaining independence in 1947 following the partition from Pakistan, with the All-India Muslim League aiming to create an Islamic state but excluding Bengal, which eventually gained independence as Bangladesh in 1971 after a violent struggle against Pakistan.\nThe rise of the Global South is reshaping the global economic landscape, driving economic diversification, expanding trade and investment, and promoting sustainable development, inclusive growth, and equitable governance.\nA number of recent reports from globally recognised institutions like the Freedom House and IDEA have unequivocally concluded that freedom and democracy are in constant decline worldwide due to a surge in far-right politics, the rise of authoritarian regimes and, worst of all, stolen elections sanctioning elected dictators. The Freedom House Report 2024 concluded that democracy is under attack in every region of the world. The IDEA report reaffirmed it. These problems are perhaps more pronounced in South Asian democracies than elsewhere. South Asia is a basket case of nascent, fledgling and trembling democracies which have suffered repeated and nearly fatal setbacks before they could be firmly institutionalised. Political upheaval in Bangladesh is the latest case in point. Last week, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country just after seven months of claiming unrivalled electoral victory for a fourth consecutive term in office.The downturnDemocratic deficit is pervasive in all of South Asia. Afghanistan has been under ultraconservative Taliban rule since 2021. Bangladesh, in its five-decade existence, has gone under several military coups and dictatorships and is now culminating in the collapse of Hasina's elected autocracy. After mass protests in April 2022, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also forced to leave the country; he eventually resigned while in exile, ending the nefarious 'rule of the Rajapaksa clan'. The flipflop in Pakistani democracy is seemingly a never-ending saga. Either a direct military rule or a dense shadow of the army over any so-called civilian government in history has been the signature governing feature of the Islamic Republic.The democracy scorecard of regional superpower India, often referred to as the world's largest democracy, is also not progressive. In an overall score of freedom, India declined by 10 points (scoring only 66 out of 100) during the last decade (2013-23), while Bangladesh was even worse with the loss of 13 points and got only 40 out of 100. The alleged religious intolerance in India and rigged and violent elections in Bangladesh are cited as the reasons for such decline. Although Nepal added four points to be at 62 in this particular measure, mainly due to the smooth transition of power after the last parliamentary elections in 2022, the dominance of communist ideology in Nepal's politics, in some way or another, has been a key bottleneck in consolidating and institutionalising the newly adopted federal democracy. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party won 63 lesser seats in recent elections (or 240 only) compared to the 2019 elections. It fell short of securing majority seats in the 543-member lower house, the Lok Sabha. The ailmentsThe trigger for protests to overthrow regimes may vary according to the country’s context. For example, the Sri Lankan protests resulted from increasing economic hardships, as the state coffers emptied and the government introduced extreme rationing of essential commodities. On the contrary, Bangladesh was lauded as a miracle in economic growth, with quadrupled per capita income from $698 in 2009 to $2,688 in 2022. Despite this, protests erupted against the government’s decision to reserve a 30 percent quota of government jobs for the families of veterans of the freedom struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971.But again, they were only the triggers. The real reasons, generally common to all countries of the region, are long-accumulated discontent against nepotism, corruption, brutal suppression of dissenting voices, misrule, use of state mechanisms to rig elections and growing hopelessness among the youths, among several other factors.At the core of every malaise is the lack of democratic intent in major political players in these countries. Instead of empowering and ensuring the impartiality of key democratic institutions like the judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy and security apparatus, there is a growing tendency to make them subservient to serve the interests of the ruling elites. Atrocities to silence opposition voices and revenge politics when in power are common in the politics of the entire subcontinent. In the majority of these countries, only a handful of 'elite' families have monopolised their countries' politics for long. Regime stability is often misinterpreted as democratic stability. Therefore, the quest for institutionalising democracy in South Asian nations has proven to be a mirage by design, not by default. The geopoliticsIn each of South Asian nations except India, the leadership across the political spectrum is convinced that it can rise to or retain power only if it can secure support from a regional superpower. Traditionally, these political forces, barring the Pakistanis, competed to get the favour of the Indian establishment. But now, with the rise of China as the next-door economic powerhouse and its manifested interest in expanding the sphere of influence in South Asia, both India and China are competing to cultivate and nurture their 'pet' leaders in each of these countries. In the process, they overlook falling mercury in the popularity barometer of the leaders they favoured. These superpowers put forth their rather elusive 'security concern' argument to rationalise their engagement.The current Bangladesh imbroglio is the latest example. Sheikh Hasina got unconditional support from New Delhi despite her anti-democratic excesses. Modi government did not even warn not to compromise fundamental democratic values while dealing with the opposition. Indian diplomacy seemed too preoccupied with the alleged collusion of Hasina's detractors with the forces not friendly to India. India follows a similar pattern of diplomacy in other neighbouring countries as well. This has unleashed a trend of vertical split between the political forces trying to win either Indian or Chinese favour, also in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Pakistan is already in the Chinese lap. In this race to increase strategic influence, democracy ceases to be a defining variable.Instead of banking on a single personality like Hasina, India, as a regional superpower and the largest democracy, ideally should have contributed to institutionalising democracy in the neighbourhood by charting out a subcontinental democratic axis. This could serve a double purpose: To protect its traditional sphere of influence and stabilise democracy in the entire neighbourhood. But, at present, Lutyens' Delhi seems more preoccupied with the preset narrative of security concern than internalising the benign effects of promoting genuine democracy in neighbouring countries as its topmost agenda of 'neighbourhood first' policy. \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the biggest sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nAt the recent CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League, the Nepali women’s team captured national attention when they beat the mighty Indian team, by three sets to two. After a tumultuous subsequent journey, including the bitter first loss to Iran 2-3, a victory over the Maldives 3-0, and another win over Iran in straight sets, Nepal reached the finals to face India again. Our women fought valiantly, but unfortunately, they couldn’t win the trophy. Their performance, nonetheless, has certainly raised the visibility of women’s sports in Nepal. Over the years, more and more Nepali women have ventured into the world of sports, be it football, cricket, or volleyball. And they are not just participating; they are excelling. The Nepali women’s football team is a case in point. In the FIFA World rankings, they stand in the 101st position, which is way higher than the Nepali men team’s ranking of 175. But then, patriarchal mindsets still drag them down. In Nepal’s case, exceptions aside, women’s athletes and players barely get noticed unless they do exceptionally well. Apparently, many people aren’t as fond of women’s sports as they are of men’s. This stems from the belief that women are unsporty and less competitive compared to men. This is where the problem lies, as it not only discourages young girls and women but also impedes policymakers from introducing women-friendly sports policies. Moreover, many of our policies and provisions are far from conducive to upskilling them. Nepal, for instance, has no women’s football league. Nor do we have a professional setup, as the women’s national football team relies on teams from security forces, including Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army. This does not make sense. Sports analysts see greater prospects of Nepali women qualifying for top international events like women’s cricket and football world cups compared to men—but only if they get a level playing field, proper training and enough top-notch match practice. There is also great disparity in terms of pay. Earlier this year, the Cricket Association of Nepal announced the players’ salary contracts, in which a significant payscale difference is evident: While the Grade A male cricketer will receive Rs100,000 a month, a female cricketer of the same grade will get only Rs50,000. Such a glaring gap will greatly discourage our girls from taking up sports of any kind. When it comes to unequal pay in sports, many jump to the conclusion that men participate in more tournaments and spend more of their time playing, so they deserve to earn more. However, they don’t consider if women are being given the same kind of opportunities in terms of resources and high-level match practice. Nepali women deserve every facility and perk that is being extended to their male counterparts. There have been some encouraging developments too. For instance, the initiative of the All Nepal Football Association to pay men and women footballers equally starting 2020 is laudable, as this will encourage more young girls to take up football. As Nepali women have soared to new heights in sports in the past few years, even with the limited resources at their disposal, it is the state’s responsibility to invest in them. On current evidence, they will then bring a lot of sporting glory to their homeland.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe weather across the country on Wednesday is expected to be generally cloudy.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nAfter a decade, the House of Representatives amended the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act, allowing non-amnesty for serious human rights violations and ensuring victim-centric transitional justice.\nBechan Jha, a suspect in the Bhutanese refugee scam, faces charges of state fraud, forgery, and cheating as a hearing is scheduled for Thursday in the Kathmandu District Court after his arrest on June 28 and subsequent refusal to take a polygraph test.\nAmidst a surge in COVID cases, Nepal plans to roll out a monovalent vaccine for vulnerable groups, including elderly, immunocompromised, and children, as the Omicron sub-variant XBB.1.5 drives infections with a positivity rate of 13.68%.\nNepal plans to hold a SAARC Council of Ministers meeting on September 26th on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly, aiming to revitalize the South Asian regional organization that has been stalled due to India-Pakistan tensions.\nWriter-director Manoj Pandit utilizes literature's insights into human nature and emotions in his films, broadening his perspectives on social and political issues through reading nonfiction and books that blur fiction and reality.\nFollowing a deadly bus accident, the Ministry of Home Affairs recommends GPS tracking, regular inspections, and other measures to improve road safety.\nIt has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.The World Health Organisation on Wednesday declared mpox a global public health emergency for the second time in two years, following an outbreak of the viral infection in Democratic Republic of Congo that has spread to neighbouring countries.An emergency committee met earlier on Wednesday to advise WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus on whether the disease outbreak constitutes a “public health emergency of international concern,” or PHEIC.PHEIC status is WHO’s highest level of alert and aims to accelerate research, funding and international public health measures and cooperation to contain a disease.“It’s clear that a coordinated international response is essential to stop these outbreaks and save lives,” said Tedros.Mpox can spread through close contact. Usually mild, it is fatal in rare cases. It causes flu-like symptoms and pus-filled lesions on the body.The outbreak in Congo began with the spread of an endemic strain, known as clade I. But a new variant, clade Ib, appears to spread more easily through routine close contact, including sexual contact.It has spread from Congo to neighbouring countries, including Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, triggering the action from the WHO.“The detection and rapid spread of a new clade of mpox in eastern DRC, its detection in neighbouring countries that had not previously reported mpox, and the potential for further spread within Africa and beyond is very worrying,” Tedros added.Tedros said on Wednesday that WHO had released $1.5 million in contingency funds and plans to release more in the coming days. WHO’s response plan would require an initial $15 million, and the agency plans to appeal to donors for funding.Earlier this week, Africa’s top public health body declared an mpox emergency for the continent after warning that the viral infection was spreading at an alarming rate, with more than 17,000 suspected cases and more than 500 deaths this year, mainly among children in Congo.Professor Dimie Ogoina, chair of WHO’s mpox emergency committee, said all members unanimously agreed that the current upsurge of cases is an “extraordinary event,” with a record number of cases in Congo.Vaccines and behaviour change helped stop the spread when a different strain of mpox spread globally, primarily among men who have sex with men, and WHO declared an emergency in 2022.In Congo, the transmission routes need further study, WHO said. No vaccines are yet available, although efforts are underway to change that and work out who best to target. The agency also appealed to countries with stockpiles to donate shots. \nNepal Oil Corporation has reduced the price of petroleum products, effective from Friday midnight.The corporation has slashed the price of petrol by Rs5 per litre and that of diesel and kerosene by Re3 per litre.As per the new adjusted price, petrol will cost Rs165/litre and diesel and kerosene will cost Rs155/litre in Kathmandu, Pokhara and Dipayal.In Surkhet and Dang, consumers will have to pay Rs164 for a litre of petrol, while the price of diesel and kerosene will be Rs154 per litre.Likewise, petrol will cost Rs162.5 for a litre in Charaali, Biratnagar, Janakpur, Amlekhgunj, Bhalwari, Nepalgunj, Dhangadhi and Birgunj while diesel will be 152.5 per litre.In Nepal, under the automatic fuel price mechanism, the corporation sets prices based on the tariff it receives from its sole supplier, the Indian Oil Corporation.The oil monopoly announced that the price of petrol has decreased by Rs5.00 per litre, while diesel and kerosene prices have decreased by Rs3.00 per litre, as per the tariff from the IOC.The price of LP gas and aviation fuel have remained unchanged. \nWith the Paris 2024 Olympics concluding earlier this week, Nepali players have returned home. All seven athletes returned empty handed, having failed to break the 60-year spell of participating in Olympics without winning a medal. Those scratching their heads as to why Nepal has had a dry run all these decades needn’t look further than the Dasharath Stadium, located at the nerve centre of Kathmandu. The country’s most famous stadium was a sight to see on Tuesday. Nepal’s Church Boys United lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC, which was a shock for Nepali fans. But the match result was hardly a topic of discussion on Tuesday evening. Rather, it was the ground of the country’s only international-standard stadium hosting an international match. It was a messy affair on the ground as the 22 boys jostled for the ball, slipping on the puddled, muddy ground all the time. As the Nepali players struggled to clinch a win against the visiting team, the photographs circulating on social and mainstream media, of the players drenched in sludge, gave an early indication that Nepal was set to lose an image war internationally. The Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda, a member of the Bhutan squad, was right on point when he called the Bhadrakali ground a joke. It’s not clear whether Nepali authorities have taken Honda’s remark as an insult to Nepal or ignored it completely, but Honda, who has played three world cups for Japan, should be thanked for pointing out our pathetic state. The tamasha at the stadium exposed the state of our sports infrastructure and the insincerity of our authorities even when it comes to organising an international event.Alarmingly, the situation is no different in cricket, volleyball or martial arts. Nepali youths have tremendous interest and potential in sports, in addition to a fan base envied by the world. Impressed by our young talents, the international sports fraternity has shown unprecedented interest towards Nepal in recent years. But the authorities remain as lethargic as ever even to cash in on the international goodwill.There is no dearth of literature on the lackadaisical attitude of Nepali sports authorities. But there are some basics they should do immediately if Nepali sports is to get any better. First, the authorities must work to strengthen the financial security of the players. Only then we can expect better results from them. If the sportspeople are playing for the country, it is the country that should look after their needs. The prime ministers, ministers and other officials who compete to make big announcements after a Nepali team’s win in an international match should learn to walk the talk.Second, the authorities should work immediately to improve sports infrastructure. If the Dasharath Stadium is muddy, the Kirtipur Cricket Ground has no light. The Mulpani Cricket Stadium has taken decades to complete, and there are hardly any decent stadiums outside the capital city, and players are deprived of training and international exposure. The authorities must therefore ensure that the sports bodies strictly follow a calendar of events throughout the year from federal to the grassroots level to ensure a holistic development of the sector. If we continue to make the players dodge the sludge on their training ground, we cannot expect them to return home with international medals.  \nSri Lanka’s presidential election, scheduled for September 21, is taking an interesting turn. The Sri Lanka Podujana Peremuna (SLPP), which initially planned to nominate Ranil Wickramasinghe as the presidential candidate, has now nominated Namal Rajapakse, the son of former President Mahinda Rajapakse. Wickremesinghe was delaying his candidature announcement, giving rise to speculation that he was not interested in becoming the official nominee of SLPP, which would undermine the future of the United National Party (UNP) he heads. SLPP demanded that if Wickremesinghe wants to contest the position, he must resign from the UNP. The problem started after some of his supporters from the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) proposed to sideline the Rajapakses. Moreover, Namal Rajapakse opposed Wickremesinghe’s contest from SLPP, forcing the party to reconsider its decision.Yet, Wickremesinghe has garnered support from many SLPP and Samagi Jana Balavegaya (SJB) parliamentarians for his candidature. He has decided to contest as an independent candidate, stating that a non-party, common candidate is the need of the hour. He expects people to vote based on his performance in the last two years. The Freedom People’s Congress (FPC), a breakaway faction of SLPP, has decided to join the SJB, while another faction joined the UNP headed by Wickremesinghe. One is witnessing several permutations and combinations. At the first Ekwa Jayagamu (Victory through Unity) rally in Matara, the President called on other parties to put their personal agendas aside and work for the country. The presidential frayApart from the sitting president Wickremesinghe, who the SLPP supports at present, and Namal, the party’s official candidate in this election, Sajith Premadasa—son of former President of Sri Lanka Ranasinghe Premadasa of SJB—and Anura Kamara Dissanayake, also known as AKD of National People’s Power (NPP)—the new avatar of JVP with its notorious violent past—are also contesting. Both had contested the last presidential election and lost to Gotabaya Rajapakse. Sajith had broken away from the UNP and formed the SJB with others after having serious differences with Ranil Wickremesinghe. But Wickremesinghe benefited from the 2022 Jana Aragalaya (people’s movement). Wickremesinghe, who was the prime minister, took over as President after Gotabaya was forced to quit. Other actorsThe Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) established by the Bandaranaike family is faction-ridden, with three leaders claiming party presidency, and one faction has extended support to Sajith Premadasa. P Ariyanethiran is a Tamil candidate representing the Ilankai Thamil Arasu Katchchi (ITAK), part of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA). After the death of the TNA supremo, it is ridden with factionalism. The Tamils have previously voted for major political parties in the presidential election. They form a crucial vote bank that can determine the outcome of the September election, as seen in the past. Many attribute the LTTE’s boycott of the 2004 election contributed to the victory of Mahinda Rajapakse.Campaign strategiesWickramasinghe’s campaigning strategy is based on Sri Lanka’s economic recovery. According to the World Bank, it is on the road to recovery, even though it considers debt restructuring inadequate and emphasises structural reforms. He wants to capitalise on this. In May, the Sri Lankan government introduced three Bills—the Economic Transformation Bill, the Public Debt Management Bill and the Public Financial Management Bill, which faced significant opposition from the SJB and the NPP. The government’s effort has been debt restructuring to utilise valuable foreign currency for economic development and attract investment. Wickramasinghe has asked all the political forces to join and, interestingly, has offered Sajith restoration of his UNP membership if he cooperates. Wickremesinghe is going to address his second rally on August 17 in Anuradhapura. His supporters, drawn from several political parties, want to form a new front to support his election. A main advantage for him is that he came to lead the country at a time when others, especially SJB’s Sajith—who came second in the 2019 Presidential election—were not prepared to take responsibility. Wickramasinghe, in his first Anuradhapura rally in July, also said that Sri Lanka’s GDP is $85 million, which should be increased to $350 million by 2028. Whether he will receive the support of the minorities is yet to be seen.Sajith Premadasa had lost the election to Gotabaya in 2019. Yet, unlike R Premadasa, he is not a charismatic leader who keeps ears to the ground. The SJB, which has formed a coalition of seven parties, will fight the election under the Samagi Jana Sandanaya (SJS) platform. Sajith has promised to continue with the IMF reforms to bring the economy back on track. The party has prioritised anti-corruption as its main plank. It is looking for the support of the minorities and has been able to enlist the support of the Tamil Progressive Alliance (TPA) headed by Mano Ganesan, who represents Malaiyaha Tamils spread across the Central, Southern and Western provinces and that of Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.The left-leaning NPP (formerly JVP) is a strong contender in this presidential election. Its leader, Anura Kumara Bandaranaike, has visited India and other Western countries to ally the fear of these countries, given JVP’s violent past and its anti-India and anti-Western stances in the past. JVP’s leader Bandaranaike is leading in various opinion polls. In recent rallies, he has drawn massive crowds with his slogan of ushering in a ‘new renaissance’. His promises include political and economic reforms.Among all these candidates, Namal Rajapakse bears the burden of everything that has gone wrong with Sri Lanka recently. Namal has previously been a sports minister and thus has political experience. The removal of his uncle Gotabaya Rajapakse and the alleged corruption his family was involved in are still etched in people’s minds. Namal may not find an easy way, and the opinion poll puts him in a distant third.Difficult choiceWith political fragmentation across all the political parties except for the NPP, it would be difficult for voters to choose. Wickremesinghe stood a good chance and perhaps could have pulled through with the support of the SLPP and his performance in the last two years. But the NPP appears stronger and more focussed, and has a clear vision for the country. Unlike other political parties, it is not tried and tested. Its violent past and radical left ideology perhaps would not help the IMF reform plans on which Sri Lanka depends. Holding a position of power may help Anura Kamara Dissanayake to moderate his stance on economic recovery and the unemployment problem and to secure the rights of the working class. \nMahpara's decision to put her career before raising a child was strongly disapproved by her in-laws, relatives, and maternal family. On the other hand, Shanaya, who wanted to devote herself to her home responsibilities, endured ridicule from her friends and acquaintances, who said she was wasting her years of education. Both did not receive the support they needed, though they wanted to take charge of their own life by coming to their own conclusions. From these two scenarios, the question that comes to my mind is: do we really practice empowering women? Or is it only a catchphrase used in corporate-sponsored social events?Research and surveys indicate that gender parity in Bangladesh has improved in all areas due to women's increased participation in socio-economic and political activities. In recent years, Bangladesh has witnessed significant advancements in women's empowerment, resulting in noteworthy societal transformations. Unfortunately, the concept of women's empowerment is often construed narrowly in Bangladesh and many other parts of the world, linking it mainly to women's employment outside the home or in official workplaces. A limited perspective cannot do justice to the diversity of women's experiences and the multitude of ways that empowerment can manifest itself.Despite enormous progress toward gender equality and women's rights, common misconceptions often associate women's empowerment with working for a living. On the other hand, those who opt to devote themselves to household responsibilities, receive less respect. However, there are five distinct categories of women's empowerment: social, educational, political, economic, and psychological. Unfortunately, the general perspective overlooks the essential contributions made by women in a wide range of sectors, including but not limited to childcare and house management. The realisation that women's empowerment entails more than merely engaging only in external workplaces emphasises the need for a clear and established definition of empowerment.True empowerment is built on empowering women to make life decisions free from outside pressures like discrimination, constraints, or societal standards. Women should have the freedom to pursue their interests and ambitions, regardless of whether that coincide with conventional gender stereotypes. Regardless of the route women choose, empowering them requires acknowledging and appreciating their efforts. This can involve dedicating oneself to domestic duties and family obligations or pursuing a career or engaging in both. Women will gain personally from having the autonomy to make their own decisions, as will their families and society at large. Therefore, we must acknowledge that while it is common for women to choose to work outside, it is also acceptable for other women not to make that decision. No one should have to cope with negative societal reactions from people making critical comments about them.Bangladeshi women face a range of challenges as they balance the complex interactions between work and home responsibilities. The strain to balance work and home responsibilities to live up to the social expectations of women's empowerment frequently hurts women's welfare and exacerbates gender inequity. According to studies, women who juggle two or more roles have higher levels of stress, burnout, and mental health issues. All of these take place in the name of women's empowerment, which is mostly promoted on social media. The slogans \"perfect women can balance both career and home\" and \"mothers are humans with supernatural powers\" have unexpectedly gained popularity. Why is possessing superhuman abilities a prerequisite for being a good mother?We really should try to reframe the idea of women's empowerment. To enhance it, we need activism, education, and information that questions established social norms and fosters an inclusive society that honours women's choices. An effort should be made to create supportive settings that enable women to make informed and autonomous decisions about their lives, rather than unjustifiably pressuring them to go above and beyond what is expected of them at home and at work. This means challenging ingrained social conventions that uphold the notion of \"having it all\" and promoting policies and legislation that encourage fair distribution of caregiving duties, accommodating work hours, and a positive work-life balance. Research-based mediation can play a significant role in reducing barriers that obstruct the real relevance of women's empowerment. In addition, it is critical that individuals, groups, and communities actively support women in their pursuit of self-determination and autonomy.In Bangladesh, redefining women's empowerment will require a comprehensive plan and a fundamental shift in public perception. One that acknowledges the complexity of women's lives. One that goes beyond restrictive categories and acknowledges the diversity of women's experiences and aspirations. In order to build a more equitable and inclusive society where all women can thrive and contribute positively, women's choices should be prioritised.Women's empowerment should be more than just a buzzword; it needs to be a reality demonstrated by freedom, dignity, and true choice.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nIndia’s new foreign secretary Vikram Misri returned to New Delhi on Monday after a 32-hour whirlwind tour around Kathmandu. Not much was expected of the visit, as it was supposed to be a courtesy call, a continuation of the tradition of Indian foreign secretaries visiting neighbouring countries after their appointment. So there were no significant breakthroughs in outstanding issues—just an exchange of pleasantries and congratulations over chiya-kaffee. A rendezvous with no agenda is a good thing once in a while—after all, neighbours can’t just engage in geopolitical hard talk all the time. However, here’s wishing the visiting dignitary had some time to step out of the prime ministerial and presidential chambers onto the streets. For the monsoon-battered, puddled roads reflect reality better than the glossy floors of Baluwatar and Sheetal Niwas. Having recently seen a diplomatic whodunnit in Bangladesh, Indian Babus would certainly want to touch base with ground reality in the neighbourhood.Nepal and Bangladesh have different political contexts, including in terms of parliamentary politics. Having faced Sheikh Hasina's seemingly tight grip on state affairs for over a decade and a half, Bangladeshis were fidgeting for a change as democracy was on the wane. With 13 government changes in 16 years, Nepal remains committed to democracy although Nepalis are looking for a change, seeking stability. India remained tight-lipped on the goings-on in Bangladesh even as Hasina sought a fourth consecutive term this January by keeping opposition leaders behind bars. Apart from being the biggest trade partner in South Asia, Bangladesh was a “friendly” nation to India, thanks to Hasina’s indebtedness to India from 1971 all the way to 2024. As long as the person of its liking was in power in Dhaka, India chose to remain silent to the calls for democracy, free press and fair elections in Bangladesh, only to jolt back to reality when the tide of change swept Hasina off her feet, and the comfort of dealing with a friendly ruler in the neighbourhood became a thing of the past.Luckily for Misri, things are not too bad in Nepal. But when was the last time a top Indian diplomat spoke about the report of the Eminent Persons Group that is collecting dust due to Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s reluctance to so much as acknowledge it? When will India acknowledge Bhairahawa Airport as Nepal’s major development infrastructure and provide the air space for it to operate fully? And when will the Babus in New Delhi’s North Block stop using the language of Nepal, a supposed backyard of India, being taken over by China? When Misri returns to Nepal for a definitive diplomatic visit, he would want to come up with some fresh ideas and spend a bit more time to understand the subterranean tides of change. Nepal might have been ruled by old leaders milking their legacy of the 1990s politics when Misri was still a young foreign services officer in India, but the old Indian lenses used to look at Nepal now need replacing.  \nBrands and Beyond 2024, an event to bring together marketing and branding professionals to discuss the latest industry trends and innovations, kicked off in Kathmandu, Nepal on Thursday.The event will feature a distinguished lineup of speakers from Nepal and abroad, the organisers said.Among the speakers are Karpat Polat, creative chairman at K A R P A T, Guan Hin Tay, creative chairman at BBDO Singapore, Cristiano Tonnarelli, a creative powerhouse with 14 Cannes Lions, Rajeev R Menon, chief executive creative officer at Ogilvy, Shubho Sengupta, digital marketer and head of communications at Karmayogi Bharat, Prathap Suthan, chief creative officer at Bang in the Middle, known for the iconic 'India Shining' and 'Incredible India' campaigns.The event taking place at the Yak and Yeti Hotel in Kathmandu is partnered by Kantipur TV, Kantipur Publications, Kantipur Radio, and The Kathmandu Post. The Brandguff has organised this two-day programme.The event will feature masterclasses, interactive sessions, and networking opportunities, aiming to foster innovation and excellence in marketing practices, the organisers said. \nThailand's governing alliance agreed on Thursday to back 37-year-old political newcomer Paetongtarn Shinawatra as its candidate for prime minister, a day ahead of a pivotal vote in parliament.The deal follows a flurry of behind-the-scenes talks in the 24 hours since a court dismissed Srettha Thavisin as premier, as his Pheu Thai Party rushed to secure backing from its 11-party alliance in a bid to form the next government.Paetongtarn is the daughter of divisive political heavyweight Thaksin Shinawatra, and a niece of Yingluck Shinawatra, both former premiers who fled into exile after military coups against their governments.Wednesday's dismissal of Srettha by the Constitutional Court was the latest hammer blow for Pheu Thai, the populist electoral juggernaut of the billionaire Shinawatra family that has locked horns for two decades with Thailand's influential establishment and royalist military.If successful in Friday's vote, Paetongtarn would be Thailand's second female prime minister and the third Shinawatra to hold the top post.\"We were confident that under her leadership, we will all support her and be ready to carry out her policies from the day she assumes office,\" Anutin Charnvirakul, leader of the Bhumjaithai Party, told a press conference to announce Paetongtarn as candidate.Srettha was the movement's fourth premier to be removed by a court ruling and his downfall could indicate the end of an uneasy detente between Thaksin and his enemies in the conservative elite and military old guard, which had enabled the tycoon's return from self-exile in 2023 and ally Srettha to become premier the same day.The 11-party alliance holds 314 seats in the house, of which 141 belong to Pheu Thai, and should have no difficulty electing a prime minister on Friday, providing it remains intact.To become premier a candidate needs the approval of more than half of the current 493 lawmakers. \nThousands of women marched across several Indian cities overnight and Prime Minister Narendra Modi called for strict punishment for crimes against women, as outrage and protests against the gruesome rape and murder of a doctor escalated.Holding candles and posters that said “reclaim the night”, women held marches across cities, including the eastern Indian city of Kolkata, where the rape and murder of a trainee doctor last week has triggered protests by fellow medics, demanding better and safer working conditions.Many government hospitals in cities across India suspended all services except emergency departments earlier this week, as junior doctors sat outside in protest, demanding justice for the victim.The 31-year-old doctor was found dead on Friday. Police said she had been raped and murdered and a police volunteer was subsequently arrested in connection with the crime.“As a society, we have to think about the atrocities being committed against our mothers, daughters and sisters. There is outrage against this in the country. I can feel this outrage,” Modi said in an address to the nation on its 78th Independence Day on Thursday.The rape has revived memories of a similar case in New Delhi in 2012, when a gang of men raped and severely injured a 23-year-old student in a moving Delhi bus, leading eventually to her death.“This horrific incident has once again reminded us that women disproportionately bear the weight of ensuring their own safety,” Bollywood actor Alia Bhatt said in a post on her Instagram page, which has more than 85 million followers.Doctors in India’s crowded and often squalid government hospitals have long complained of being overworked and underpaid, and say not enough is done to curb violence levelled at them by people angered over the medical care on offer.Crimes against women in India rose 4% in 2022 from the previous year, data from the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), released late last year, showed. \nPatan High Court Judge Rameshwar Regmi passed away on Wednesday. He was 61.Regmi breathed his last while receiving treatment at the Nepal Cancer Hospital in Harisiddhi, Lalitpur.According to Raju Shrestha, the office secretary at the Judges’ Society, Nepal, Regmi was undergoing treatment for a brain tumour.He will be cremated at the Pashupati Aryaghat today.Regmi was appointed as a high court judge in 2020 and posted to Janakpur while he was a registrar at Patan High Court, Hetauda bench. He was later transferred to Patan High Court, Lalitpur. \nGenerally cloudy conditions will prevail across the country on Thursday, the Meteorological Forecasting Division said.Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is expected at various locations in all provinces.Tonight, the cloudiness will continue nationwide, with light to moderate rain and thunder and lightning likely to persist in several areas.There is a chance of heavy rainfall in one or two locations within Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, and Gandaki provinces.The entire country is under the influence of monsoon winds, with the monsoon trough situated near the average position.On Wednesday, the highest maximum temperature recorded was 36.4°C in Janakpur, while the lowest minimum temperature was 15°C in Jomsom. The highest 24-hour rainfall was 45.7 mm in Simara. \nIn August 2014, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited the Pashupatinath Temple, a significant temple of the Hindu god Shiva.In May 2018, he visited Janakpur, the famous Hindu pilgrimage site. In May 2022, he visited Lumbini, the birthplace of Lord Buddha.His visit drew thousands of Indian visitors, particularly for pilgrimage purposes.Nepal has been a centre for Hindu and Buddhist pilgrims. It is considered the dwelling place of Lord Shiva and the birthplace of Buddha and Goddess Sita. A fraction of tourists visit Nepal for religious purposes, but Nepal has never realised the potential of spiritual products that have not been branded, marketed, and promoted.Various studies have shown that religion has become a niche product in a society overrun by commercial clutter, and it could boost the economy.Now, two brothers in Janakpur, in Nepal’s southern plain, the birthplace of Sita, have devised a unique project: The construction of Janak Dham.“The work has already started. The Dham will be spread over 22 bigas (148,998 square meters) in Chhireshwarnath Municipality-8, Dhanusha,” said Kausalendra Jha, a chartered accountant.“The project costs Rs2 billion, and it looks like a palace of King Janak. The five-year project plans to produce, promote and market religious goods and services, the first of its kind in Nepal,” said Kausalendra, who has his brother Ragvendra Jha, a hotel entrepreneur, as his investment partner.Currently, 100 cows are kept in Janak Dham. The Jha brothers plan to commercially sell more than a dozen products made from cow’s milk, including urine and dung.Under the project, agriculture and industry based on cows will be built, an Ayurveda and natural hospital, a meditation and Janak Darshan Centre, a convention hall with the capacity for 1,000 people, a resort, a children's park, and an audio-video hall will be established.Pilgrimage tourism has a higher scope in Nepal. Since Nepal has become a key gateway for the Kailash Mansarovar Yatra in Tibet, China, developing and marketing religious products could primarily benefit the local economy. Annually, 40,000 to 50,000 Indians visited Tibet using Nepal’s route before the Covid-19 pandemic. Lumbini used to host nearly 1.5 million visitors, including Nepalis, before the Covid and is now gradually recovering. In 2023, about 1.2 million people visited Lumbini, especially with a significant influx of 70,000 Indian tourists. Annually, millions visit Pashupatinath temple in Kathmandu.“We also plan to sell the products through our outlets in Sankhamul, Kathmandu and Janaki temple, Janakpur,” said Kausalendra.The construction of Janak Dham is expected to be over in five phases. The first phase has almost been completed, and cow-based agriculture and industry have already started. Preparations are ready to introduce 12 products of Janak Dham to the markets of Kathmandu and Janakpur in the first phase. Kausalendra said buttermilk, takrarishta, a traditional Ayurvedic fermented buttermilk, and five varieties of ghee, including one that can be put in the nose, will be produced.Similarly, the Dham will produce colostrum, sugar-free sweets, paneer, incense sticks, gomutra ark, a distilled form of cow urine and punarnava ark, an Ayurvedic medicine used in the treatment of jaundice, anaemia, abdominal diseases, diabetes and bleeding disorders.It will also produce organic fertiliser, jackfruit flour, kolhu edible oil, and food grains prepared traditionally. “All our products are made with cow’s milk, urine and dung. Made from A2 milk, which contains lactose and is chock-full of key nutrients like protein and calcium, all our production has Ayurvedic characteristics,” said Kausalendra.He said that as the production of Janak Dham is limited, it is currently targeted at two cities.The Dham started with 100 cows of different breeds, such as hariyana, sahibal, gir, and achhami, and plans to increase the number of cows by 400.“Madhesh is the foodgrain basket. However, the application of toxic pesticides has been impacting people’s health. The food grains nurtured by cow dung fertiliser are healthy,” Kausalendra said.The farmer of Digambarpur, where the Dham is located, has started using organic manure.Kausalendra, who worked for a long time in agriculture projects under the World Bank, said they decided to change their lifestyle during the Covid-19 period. So, the Jha brothers decided during a coronavirus lockdown to make Janak Dham.“We do not need to bring raw material from other places to produce our goods. Everything is produced here,” they said. “We plan to introduce our products to the elite class in the initial phase. The production will be increased based on the demand.” \nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nIn Nepali Congress, the position of general secretary is considered the second most powerful after the party president.Historically, some charismatic leaders have held the position in the country’s grand old party: from Krishna Prasad Bhattarai in the 1950s, to Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Girija Prasad Koirala, to now the duo of Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma.When two relatively younger and popular leaders—Thapa and Sharma—got elected as general secretaries in December 2021, they had kindled hope among young Congress members and well-wishers of the party.But over time, they have failed to implement their agendas as the establishment led by party chief Deuba is dominant. Political analysts and observers, too, say that Thapa and Sharma have failed to reflect the strength of their popular mandate in the party decision making process.Prior to its 14th general convention, the party had the provision of one elected general secretary whereas the other was nominated by the party President after the general convention. In the last convention, the party amended its statute and made it mandatory to elect both the general secretaries and other party bearers through voting.With Thapa and Sharma elected as the Congress general secretaries, they were expected to challenge the septuagenarian party President Sher Bahadur Deuba.However, as a party insider claims, the general secretary duo themselves are struggling to create their space in party leadership. This struggle is a testament to the challenges they face in cementing their influence in the Congress, says a party leader.“The party’s general secretary is usually occupied with official work,” Prakash Sharan Mahat, a Congress spokesperson, told the Post. “How active they are in the party’s internal affairs is not something I can comment on.”After being elected as the party’s general secretaries, Thapa and Sharma have publicly spoken about being kept in the dark on vital matters. For instance, while speaking at the 42nd BP Memorial programme held on July 20, Thapa said the July 1 agreement between Congress and CPN-UML reached to form a new coalition government came as a surprise.Purushottam Dahal, a senior journalist close to the Congress, says the two general secretaries didn’t understand their exact role.“The general secretary’s role is to make the party’s central secretariat functional, but they are trying to be reactionary, which is inappropriate,” Dahal told the Post. “To make the party functional, they should not wait for a green signal from the party president.”However, General Secretary Sharma rubbishes such a claim.“There have been some transformative changes in the party after we assumed the role of general secretaries,” Sharma told the Post. “From establishing a library in the party’s central office to holding the BP Koirala Literature Festival, we have made the party more vibrant.”He argued that what has happened is that the duo have failed to publicise some of their important works.The general secretaries claim they are facing difficulties because of the party leadership’s working style, but some leaders don’t buy that argument.Sharma further claims that their work is often hindered by the generational gap with Deuba.“In addition, both of us general secretaries were elected from different panels during the general convention, which caused some misunderstanding among party leaders,” Sharma said.But there are other Congress leaders who accuse the general secretaries of suddenly turning risk-averse. “They are bound by the party statute as the party follows a presidential system where the president prevails over others,” Govinda Pokharel, a newly appointed head of the Economic Policy and Planning Department of the Congress, told the Post. “However, the two general secretaries cannot accommodate all groups in the party, and hence their difficulties.” According to Pokharel, after becoming the party’s office bearers, they are slowly turning cautious. “Although they have a very popular base and they also have content-based knowledge on development, they are not being able to use their potential.” Sharma differs.“We have challenged the party leadership on many issues to establish our agenda,” Sharma said. “At the party’s Mahasamiti meeting in February, we successfully proposed contesting the upcoming election with the party’s own strength… The party's central committee meeting, which will commence on Wednesday, will pass our proposal as it is.” A Congress leader close to General Secretary Thapa, however, acknowledged that Thapa is sometimes clueless about the party’s functioning.“From the beginning, the general secretaries have not been able to mobilise the leaders in their fold effectively,” Shankar Tiwari, a Congress youth leader close to Thapa, told the Post. “Sometimes they prevail over the party president, but on many other occasions they are also at his mercy.”Meanwhile, a few Congress leaders claim that the popularity of the general secretaries duo is diminishing, which could make it difficult for them to elevate themselves in party politics in the coming days. There are ample examples where Congress leaders lost their revolutionary spirit after becoming general secretary, says the leader.Only three past general secretaries of Congress have succeeded in becoming party chief and the prime minister. Krishna Prasad Bhattarai was the general secretary of the party soon after the establishment of democracy in Nepal in 1950. Likewise, Girija Prasad Koirala, another general secretary during the 1990s, later became the prime minister as well as the party President. Sushil Koirala was the third general secretary to become party president, and the prime minister. Jagat Nepal, a long-time Congress observer, says that apart from the prime minister, two of the Congress’s general secretaries have become the country’s President, if not party president and prime minister. “Ram Baran Yadav, the first President of the country, and Ramchandra Paudel, the current President, both were once the party’s general secretary,” Nepal told the Post. Besides, Taranath Ranabhat, the former general secretary of the party, and Paudel became Speakers of the House of Representatives in the 1990s.Nepal added that despite not being elevated to the party’s top position, a few former general secretaries of Congress had played an important role in national politics. “We can’t draw a sweeping conclusion that leaders lose their influence after becoming general secretary,” he said.Apart from the leaders mentioned above, Mahendra Narayan Nidhi, Krishna Prasad Sitaula, Prakash Man Singh, Sashank Koirala, and Purna Bahadur Khadka were the few among others who took up the responsibility of the general secretary.“As far as why they were not able to lift themselves to the top position is concerned, sometimes, despite their personal efficiency, circumstances might not be favourable,” Dahal, the senior journalist, said.General Secretary Sharma echoes Dahal.In the past, the party president used to nominate one of the two general secretaries. In such a case, the nominated general secretary would obviously not be able to challenge the party chief, Sharma said. From the 14th general convention, the party started to elect both general secretaries through voting by party delegates. \nAjaya Dixit’s current work focuses on studying challenges of building resilience across boundaries and at sub-national scales. He has studied and written extensively on water resources, trans-boundary water cooperation, flood management, wash services and climate change adaptation, clean energy transition and related policy studies. In this interview with the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal, Dixit discusses river management in Nepal’s urban areas: Where have we gone wrong in this endeavour and what can we do? You have extensively studied river systems and have been following changes seen in river basins. How do you see recent problems caused by encroachment and rampant development activities?We humans have lived and have to continue to live within water cycles: water evaporates from the ocean to the sky and then precipitates to the land and flows via rivers back to the ocean. Rivers that function as arteries of the land surface, sustaining humans, aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems face widespread abuses: pollution, rampant extraction of their bed and banks, fragmentation and degradation. Without rivers, we would not be who we are. Unfortunately, we have forgotten this essence. We neglect and abuse rivers. In 1981, just after the monsoon ended, I, along with my students, walked from Sundarijal to Teku studying Bagmati rivers’ sediment. At many places, we walked on the riverbed. The river then was clean. Gradually, the river systems began to face all-round decay. I have read painful accounts of my contemporaries who remember swimming in the clean Bagmati and its tributaries. In less than 50 years, our rivers in Kathmandu Valley and other basins no longer look like rivers. I feel helpless and ache with pain at this collective failure! What state of rivers are we passing on to our next generation?River encroachment is common across Nepal but more serious in urban areas, including in Kathmandu. How can this be stopped?Our approach to rivers is an imitation of the trend common across South Asia, or the subcontinent, which is again largely based on the knowledge system developed in the industrialised Global North without contextualising locally. The region features waterscapes of high and punctuated rainfall during the monsoon months, rivers, wetlands, ponds, and springs, all connected with groundwater aquifers in one of the most complex landscapes of the world: the Himalaya-Ganga region. Yet, current development endeavours subjugate water rather than respect and live with it. In 2022, the Indus River in Pakistan faced major floods with devastating consequences. Referring to these floods, a group of global scientists stated that “the impacts [of the floods] were the outcome of an outdated river management system.” This approach is primarily based on building of physical structures such as buildings, bridges and roads close to rivers interfering with their natural flows. The approach that began in the early twentieth century keeps marching on even while we are facing twenty first century water challenges.There is an increasing trend of building corridor roads along the rivers in Kathmandu as well as other places. Is this a good or bad practice? In Nepal, road building in the hills has earned the sobriquet of “dozer roads,” meaning politically designed roads excavated by heavy machine operators without adhering to basic engineering, social, environmental, or hydrological safeguards. Even highways built with “engineering,” such as the Mugling-Narayanghat section, face regular accidents. The sliding of the two buses in the Trishuli is the recent example. Building roads along the banks of rivers, defined as “river corridors,” is the preferred approach for improving connectivity. In the Kathmandu Valley, this is also associated with rivers shackled within concrete walls in the name of river beautification. In the monsoon, however, they all overflow as we have been seeing in the last few years and this year as well.What will happen to these rivers 10-15 years down the line? Is there any chance of some of our rivers dying? Or, will the measures taken in recent times protect them?All rivers must flow clean and free in selected stretches. But today, rivers are disconnected with their floodplains. Within walls and embankments, they have become conduits of filth. Many rivers are already seriously degraded. If the current trend continues, many rivers may die. I remember Jacques-Yves Cousteau, the French oceanographer, filmmaker, and author, who wrote: “Water and air, the two essential fluids on which all life depends, have become global garbage cans.” Our current efforts at conserving, developing and managing rivers are grossly inadequate. During the Covid-19 pandemic, we saw some rivers heal as human actions across the board ceased due to the lockdown. But this healing came at huge human and economic costs. The lessons, however, are clear. We must stop turning rivers into garbage cans for them to begin to heal. The onus lies on us, our activities, our governance, and the policies we make and put into practice effectively. We need new ways of imagining rivers in harmony with human needs. Otherwise, the rivers will die. If rivers die, what will become of us?What problems may city dwellers face as a result of this continued destruction of rivers?A 2020 analysis of rivers in Nepal found that the quality of rivers in the mid-hills and the Tarai are already deteriorating. Industries, cities, towns, and agriculture produce waste that, when disposed of in rivers untreated, cause pollution. Solid and liquid wastes produced by expanding cities and towns pollute nearby rivers, streams, and water bodies. Pollution kills aquatic life such as fish, which are sources of livelihood for many communities. Polluted rivers and water bodies degrade human and environmental health, leading to negative impacts on human livelihoods. The impacts of pollution on rivers are considerable during non-monsoon months when river discharge, and consequently the capacity of rivers to dilute waste, are low.What should be done to conserve the rivers, at least in the present form, and stop further damages?All rivers are a combination of water (W), energy (E), biodiversity aquatic (B), and sediment (S), represented by the acronym WEBS. In the current scheme of things, the focus is on water and energy. Aquatic ecosystems are the concern of only those working on freshwater ecosystems. They are neglected in the larger context though the state has made some provisions for conserving ecosystems. In Nepal’s Hydropower Development Policy of 2001 all hydropower plants must release 10 percent minimum flow to the downstream reaches to enable fish and other aquatic life to survive in the river. A 2021 study of 50 hydropower plants however found that none of the plants surveyed release environmental-flows. All hydropower plants, as per their power purchasing agreements, are required to produce maximum power during the dry season. We should start by accepting the fact that rivers need clean flowing water and respecting the policies we have made. Then we must systematically introduce changes and avoid the oversights embedded in the present approach. The present approach to water development and management focused on engineering and structural solutions is based on single-disciplinary education that is blind to gender and social inclusion challenges and aquatic ecosystems. In the present approach, nobody seems to want sediment which is a natural consequence of flow within the water cycle.To meet such an objective, we need to begin with a system of integrated knowledge that synthesises natural science, social science, and indigenous practices. By incorporating fields such as hydrology, ecology, social science-supported context-specific engineering, and indigenous knowledge and practices, we can take a comprehensive approach to water management challenges and solutions. Interdisciplinary approaches can build collaboration, innovation, and systemic decision-making and promote innovative water management for the benefit of both ecosystems and human societies.Do you think initiatives such as river clean up campaigns run by various groups help protect these waterways?I see such initiatives as manifestation of dissatisfaction of concerned citizens with the degradation of rivers and to bring about changes. In 1990, I was part of the Save Bagmati Campaign, which aimed to highlight the degrading state of the river. This campaign has taken many new forms, and citizen groups have begun campaigns in other rivers of Nepal. They however remain fragmented and ad-hoc. Similar campaigns in some countries have led to granting rights to rivers. In 2017, New Zealand recognised the Whanganui River and its tributaries as legal entities, acknowledging their physical and spiritual significance as “living and indivisible” and ensuring their survival, health, and integrity to balance the needs of humans and nature. Promulgations like Living Indus (Pakistan), Namami Gange river-improvement programme (India) can offer lessons for a holistic water journey. The collective voice of concerned citizens for the integrity of rivers can be a powerful medium for policy and pathway changes. Nepal must also begin country-wide river restoration initiatives. We need more dialogue and conversation around water challenges and solutions.As cities turn into concrete jungles, their water tables are said to be receding alarmingly. You often propose redesigning our settlements and development infrastructure in a way that wouldn’t disturb rivers’ natural courses and catchment areas. Could you elaborate?South Asia is a region of waterscapes containing streams, ponds, wetlands, open spaces, floodplains, springs, and underground aquifers. Yet, our towns, cities, and infrastructure are planned, designed, and built to disregard water rather than live with it. As land-centric urban growth dominates, waterscapes temporarily seem to vanish but later water comes back. In Nepali we have a saying “In twelve years a stream returns”. The present practice of urban development is obsessed with concretisation, making these areas impermeable. Rainwater, part of which would naturally infiltrate the ground, now immediately reaches the rivers already constrained by walls. The river at a downstream section immediately peaks and when the rainfall stops the river has very low discharge. Basic parameters, like the intensity of rainfall (mm per hour), are poorly recognised and used in design guidelines. The interaction of current urbanisation practices and increasing extreme rainfall, temperature and humidity rise spawned by climate change and urban heat island effects will make our urban areas as crucible of hazards, and unhealthy. A new urban future must harmoniously integrate nature, including water bodies and wetlands, and preserve natural land cover, including traditional ponds to promote groundwater recharge. It can be further achieved by preserving green open spaces, forests, gardens, permeable “sponge” pavements, and natural waterfronts for healthier communities in sustainable cities. The starting point will be recognising cities as waterscapes. Amplified mitigation of emissions of greenhouse gases at global levels remains a critical imperative in this new future. The major impacts of climate change are evident through the water cycle. Squatters settled along the riverbanks are taken as one of the major headaches in preserving rivers’ catchment areas. How can this issue be resolved?The squatters and migrants to urban regions are outcomes of the present-day political economy of development. People move to cities seeking livelihood, education, and opportunities to move up the social ladder. These groups who end up living in high-risk areas are sometimes also seen as political vote banks. This issue needs to be viewed within the larger development question including generation of local employment, new livelihood opportunities and addressing insecurities of water, food, health, and education.Recently the Supreme Court asked authorities to make septic tank and soak pit mandatory while approving building designs in order to help recharge groundwater, and a recent Cabinet meeting has banned building any structure within 40 metres on both sides of major rivers in Kathmandu, Do such measures help keep the rivers alive or is that too little too late?Such decisions, in some way, seem to underscore the notion of giving space to rivers and maintaining their integrity. Building of septic tanks as part and parcel of new houses began in the 1970s as primary treatment units that can prevent the direct dumping of human waste into rivers and water bodies. The regular cleaning and safe disposal of waste from septic tanks are emerging questions. Rivers and waterscapes face much deeper challenges, however. The present water development model marches on like a mighty tusker, trampling in its path communities, villagers, residents, natural ecosystems, the terrestrial and aquatic beings, and past memories. Turning that around will require those working on water and river integrity across geographical, social, disciplinary and political boundaries to join hands in seeking changes and laying the foundation for a new ethical social contract for rivers and waterscapes as a first step in that long journey. \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nKunwar has been the MD for just under three years. Before coming back to her homeland to join Daraz Nepal, she worked at different American companies, including Amazon, the world’s biggest e-commerce platform. In this conversation, Kunwar talks about the opportunities and challenges of running an e-commerce enterprise in Nepal, as well as the country’s overall business environment.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \nParticipants at an interaction programme have stressed cybersecurity education and awareness alongside developing a robust and practical policy framework to address the growing cyber threats and gaps in existing regulations.At the programme organised by the Information Security Response Team Nepal (npCert), in collaboration with the Centre for Cyber Security Research and Innovation (CSR) and Texas College of Management and IT, Rajib Subba, former deputy inspector general of Nepal Police, advocated for enhancing educational programmes with a focus on practical skill development to prepare the next generation of cybersecurity professionals.Likewise, Ganesh Ghimire, a FinTech expert, provided an in-depth analysis of the prospects and challenges of cross-border transactions in Nepal.He highlighted the vulnerabilities in international financial dealings and called for strengthened security measures to protect these transactions.Also speaking, Resham Bhandari, representing InfoDevelopers, stressed the importance of cyber literacy at the grassroots level. He argued that raising awareness and understanding of cyber threats among the general population is essential for creating a secure digital environment.Likewise, Chiranjibi Adhikari, president of npCert, emphasised the pressing need for a comprehensive National Cybersecurity Policy.Adhikari underscored the importance of fortifying Nepal's digital infrastructure to safeguard against rising cyber threats, highlighting the necessity of a strong policy framework to protect the nation's digital assets and ensure long-term resilience.Sharad Chandra Pyakurel, Birendra Singh Dhami, Suman Thapaliya and Dhurba Raj Sharma, general secretary of npCert, also highlighted the importance of bridging the gap between policy formulation and implementation to ensure effective execution and adaptability to emerging cyber challenges. \nThe bill to amend the Enforced Disappearances Enquiry, Truth and Reconciliation Commission Act has landed in the House of Representatives amid mixed reactions from the victims and human rights activists.Bimala Subedi, chairperson of the Law, Justice, and Human Rights Committee of the House, presented a report on the bill that was endorsed by her panel a week earlier. The committee had endorsed the bill unanimously on August 8 after considering it for over a year.The bill will see a detailed discussion on Wednesday before it is put to a vote. As the three major parties unanimously passed the bill in the House committee, there is no barrier to its endorsement from the federal parliament. However, not every stakeholder has accepted it. While hailing the bill as progressive, the Conflict Victims Women National (CVWN) Network has expressed its reservations over the classification of crimes, the proposed provision of reduced sentencing and not listing war crimes and crimes against humanity as serious violations of human rights.The bill lists rape or serious cases of sexual violence, intentional or arbitrary killing, enforced disappearances and inhumane or cruel torture as serious violations of human rights and thus non-amnestiable. Other incidents fall as human rights violations and are amnestiable. One of the provisions in the bill clears the way for reconciliation in cases other than serious violations of human rights. The attorney general cannot be forced to press ahead with a legal case in incidents of human rights violations or serious violations of human rights where there has been reconciliation or a recommendation for amnesty, according to the bill.Except in cases of rape or serious sexual violence, there can be a reduction in the sentencing by 75 percent if the perpetrators fulfil some set criteria. Decisions on reduced penalty can be taken after examining whether the perpetrators provide information on the allegations against them, whether they cooperate with the commissions on evidence collection and whether they express remorse for their acts. Similarly, before recommending a reduction in penalty, the commissions need to evaluate whether the perpetrators have apologised to the victims and made commitments to not repeating such acts. “Narrowing down the definition of serious violations of the human rights poses risk that the victims can be deprived of the rights to truth, justice and reparations,” reads a statement from the CVWN.However, another group of victims united under victims and survivors of serious human rights violations have welcomed the bills saying the agreement in the bill has generated hope for justice. They, however, have demanded their participation in the mechanisms for finalising the reparations. Now the focus of the victims should be towards ensuring that the two transitional justice commissions get the right persons to lead them.However, the Accountability Watch Committee, a rights group, has demanded the authorities concerned address serious errors in the bill before it is endorsed by the federal parliament.All disqualified Maoist combatants including child soldiers, along with the families of security personnel who died or got injured during the insurgency, will get reparation and compensation, as per the agreement. However, the issue of child soldiers, which is considered a war crime, along with crimes against humanity and other acts of war crime is not mentioned in the agreement. The rights group has expressed its reservations about the provision as well.Those who have followed the process closely say there is no denying that the present bill is progressive and three parties coming together has given a positive message for its conclusion.“Now how honest the parties are towards concluding the process will be seen through what type of people get appointed to the commissions,” Chiranjibi Bhandari, assistant professor of Conflict, Peace, and Development Studies at the Tribhuvan University, told the Post. “If competent persons with higher social acceptance get to the position, they can take the process ahead finding pragmatic ways.” \nAmidst the ongoing Maoist Centre (CPN) standing committee meeting, party leaders have demanded a leadership change, challenging Chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal's control and questioning the efficacy of current policies.\nThe Nepali Congress dissidents demand a timely 15th general convention in December 2023, criticizing the party leadership's history of delaying conventions and demanding adherence to the charter's four-year cycle.\nIndia's new Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri visited Nepal for familiarization, meeting with President Ramchandra Paudel, Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, and other leaders to discuss bilateral relations, hydropower development, climate change minimization, and a possible visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nKathmandu prohibits construction within 40 meters of riverbanks, with a 20-meter extension, and mandates water conservation and legal action for violations.\nAfter a century-long absence caused by the 1934 earthquake, the Ranjitkar Lakhe dance is being revived in Bhaktapur ahead of Indra Jatra, thanks to the efforts of young dancers trained by experienced Newari arts teachers.\nLions Club of Kathmandu honored individuals and businesses for their societal contributions, including Prateek Pradhan for journalism, Erika Gurung for sports, and Ramesh Corporation for corporate responsibility.\nThe government has declared a public holiday in the Kathmandu Valley on Sunday to celebrate the Bhoto Jatra.On the occasion of the festival, a public holiday has been declared in the three districts of Kathmandu Valley [Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur], according to a statement by Narayan Prasad Bhattarai, spokesperson for the Ministry of Home Affairs, on Friday.The government announces a public holiday each year on this occasion.The month-long chariot-pulling festival of Rato Machhindranath concludes with the displaying of a bhoto (a jewel-studded vest) at Jawalakhel, Lalitpur. It is an annual cultural and religious ritual of displaying the black jewel-studded vest believed to be of then Nagraj, the serpent King.Machhindranath is revered as the God of rain, good harvest and prosperity. Paying homage to Lord Machhindranath is believed to bring good luck and fulfil one’s wishes. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \n All Ncell numbers and customers can receive one-time passwords (OTPs), short message services (SMSes), and other notifications, irrespective of shortcodes or service providers. This is especially important for the renowned government bodies that require customer numbers as part of their KYC requirements or maintain customer databases to ensure efficient and timely communication about their services/important notices, etc., to Nepali citizens.As the use of digital services continues to grow, customers often receive Application to Person (A2P) messages such as OTPs, SMS, and notifications from various service providers, including government bodies, semi-government agencies, banks and financial institutions (BFIs), private sector organizations, and global platforms like Google and Facebook. “We have no issues with A2P messages or notifications delivery in any number range. The increasing flow of A2P messages every year is a positive indicator of the growing digitalization, ensuring that our end users remain Always On,” said Umair Mohsin, Chief Commercial Officer of Ncell. “Some initial issues were observed with our 970 number range; however, we re-iterate that those have already been resolved with prompt understanding from various major service providers.” Clarifying misconceptions about SMSes, OPTs, and notifications delivery, Ncell stated that all Ncell mobile numbers are eligible to receive such messages within the country and outside on international roaming. The company also urged other short-code owners and service providers to include the new 970 number range in their system. Ncell began issuing new mobile numbers starting with this new number range last year to better serve its customers.  \nMonths passed, several promises were made, and finally, the government changed. For months, dairy farmers have been waiting for the government to make both state-owned and private dairies liable to pay their dues. Since December, the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation and private dairies have not paid farmers, and according to rough estimates by the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal, a group of farmers, the dues have now piled up to Rs6.5 billion. Most farmers pay their children’s school fees, hospital bills, and food bills with their income from selling milk. Some of their earnings go to buying animal fodder.“The government changed, but the issues have not been resolved,” said Ganesh Chandra Timilsina, coordinator of the National Peasants' Coalition Nepal. “Farmers will make a last-ditch effort now. They will hit the streets.”“The total dues now amount to Rs6.5 billion, even after farmers have received partial payment.”Farmers are holding a meeting on August 19 to announce various protest programmes. “Since it’s a new government, we decided to wait if it could address our grievances,” said Timilsina.The issue has been raised in Parliament, too. On Tuesday, lawmaker Gagan Thapa said the government would soon release Rs600 million to the DDC to pay the farmers. Thapa’s party, Nepali Congress, is the biggest partner in the KP Sharma Oli-led coalition.“It’s a good beginning for the new government. But the government should also realise that problems will recur, particularly in the dairy sector,” Thapa told the House of Representatives.He said that the Agriculture and Industry ministers should discuss exporting milk to Bangladesh and China. If Nepal is able to export milk to these countries, farmers can get better prices.Ramnath Adhikari, minister for agriculture and livestock development, has asked the farmers’ group to wait for 10–15 days more. The farmers' group met with the agriculture minister last Friday. “We don’t have much hope from the minister as well,” said Timilsina, adding that they have received lofty promises from several governments, but their issues remain unresolved.Former agriculture minister Jwala Kumari Sah, too, had promised to address the issue.The private dairy associations say their dues to farmers have reached over Rs2 billion.Prahlad Dahal, president of the Nepal Dairy Association, said they (private dairy) owe Rs2 billion to the farmers. “There are rumours in the market that we owe farmers Rs4.5 billion. It’s not true.”“We have been paying the farmers partially.”He said that the demand for dairy products has grown. “We are not able to pay farmers the whole sum. We are gradually clearing their dues,” said Dahal.“As big dairies fail to pay the farmers, the amount has become bigger.”On March 4, three private dairy associations—Central Dairy Cooperatives Association, Nepal Dairy Association, and Dairy Industry Association—the state-owned Dairy Development Corporation, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock Development had signed a trilateral agreement to pay farmers' their dues by April 3.Dairy farmers, however, said there were no representatives from their side during its signing.However, the government failed to commit to requiring the dairy associations to pay the farmers' dues.According to the dairy association, the state-owned dairy supplier covers 30 percent of Nepal’s dairy market, and the rest is catered by private dairies. Private dairies have around 2,000 tonnes of butter in stock. Nearly 3,000 tonnes of milk, valued at Rs90 million, arrives in the market daily across the country through private and state-owned diaries.The informal milk trade—from farmers to customers—is even bigger.Surya Prasad Paudel, general manager of the Dairy Development Corporation, said that the corporation has 750 tonnes of butter and 850 tonnes of powdered milk in stock.“We requested a loan of Rs600 million with the agriculture ministry a few months ago, but we have not received it yet. We have heard that it is still being processed,” said Paudel, adding that the corporation was doing its best to clear farmers' dues by taking loans.In February, the corporation sought a bailout fund from the finance ministry. Subsequently, in March, the government decided to provide the credit.The corporation earlier said that due to the economic slowdown, consumption of dairy products has dropped sharply, putting them in a difficult situation.Agriculture is the mainstay of Nepal's economy. It contributes 24.60 percent to the country's GDP and employs more than half the population. The share of the dairy sector in the agricultural GDP is 8 percent. \nThe DIGI Nepal Fintech Challenge, a part of the Digital innovation for growth and inclusion in Nepal (DIGI Nepal), has been launched in Nepal.A Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) programme implemented by True North Associates (TNA) in Nepal, the initiative aims to promote digital innovation within Nepal’s fintech sector.Under this programme, five applicants will be selected to join the programme’s accelerator, which offers funded technical assistance to help participants refine their business models and products, the organisers said.The accelerator also offers hands-on business model and product refinement workshops, mentorship, networking opportunities with investors and industry stakeholders, and potential access to Swiss experts, according to the organisers.The deadline for application is August 31 and the application form is available at www.tna.com.np/fintechchallenge, the TNA said. \nVijaya Motors, the sole distributor for Subaru Corporation, Japan, has unveiled two new variants—the Subaru 2.0 Crosstrek Hybrid EyeSight® and the 2.5 Outback Touring EyeSight®.

The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.At least 50 people from four districts—38 in Lalitpur, eight in Kailali, and two each in Kathmandu and Pyuthan districts—have contracted cholera so far this year. Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients.Public health experts said that detected cases of cholera infection could be just a tip of the iceberg, as most of the positive cases are being reported from the districts having active surveillance, including the three districts of the Kathmandu Valley and Kailali.Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Vaccines against the deadly disease were administered in Kapilvastu and Rautahat districts in the past after all efforts to contain the spread of the disease failed.Health officials concede that even if they have discussed the issue of inoculating people from the disease hit areas with anti cholera vaccine, it is easier said than done. They said that finding an anti-cholera vaccine is challenging, as production of the vaccine itself is very low. Moreover, the government has not allocated a budget for the programme.“We have also talked with representatives of the Global Alliance for Vaccine and Immunisation (GAVI), which provides vaccines free of cost to Nepal,” Ghimire said. “But they told us that the chance of supplying vaccines in the near future is low. We have to prepare for cholera vaccination for next year.”Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Most of the water sources contaminated with deadly microbesOfficials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that contamination of most of the sources of water—tap water, ground water, tanker water—is a main challenge to contain the spread of the cholera.“We have yet to check the quality of the jar water, which is widely used in offices, hotels and homes for drinking,” said Dr Bhuwan Paudel, chief of Health Office, Lalitpur. “But faecal coliform has been found in most of the samples of tap water, ground water and tanker water being used in Lalitpur.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, is found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.They say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are crucial to protect people from water-borne diseases.A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to experts.The World Health Organisation has also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nAlthough the extent of coronavirus spread in communities remains unclear, neither health authorities nor the public see a need for more testing. But doctors and experts, including virologists and officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, say cases of coronavirus in the country are steadily ticking up.“We won’t know the situation in communities without testing,” said Dr Janak Koirala, an infectious disease expert. “But what is true is that the number of people suffering from fever, sore throat, body aches and common cold have risen of late and some might be due to Covid.”The World Health Organisation’s report on integrated influenza and other respiratory virus surveillance for week 31 report of 2024 shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity rate of 13.68 percent.Also the latest data of the National Public Health Laboratory indicates a sharp increase in cases. Out of 5,373 tests conducted since January, 341 came out positive for Covid. The test positivity rate is 6.3 percent, which is concerning, according to experts.“Precaution should be taken if the positivity rate exceeds five percent,” said Koirala. “But we don’t know the actual condition, as neither testing nor active case finding are being conducted.”Besides the surge in coronavirus cases, coinfection of multiple viruses including coronavirus has also been detected, according to the lab report.The report shows that swab samples of 11 people having influenza-like symptoms were found to have been infected with A(H1N1) also known as swine flu, and Covid. One sample was found to have co-infection of influenza B virus and Covid. Along with Covid, influenza positivity rate is also on an upward trend. The NPHL’s report shows that the overall influenza positivity rate is 17.1 percent, meaning that 17 out of every 100 samples tested positive for influenza viruses. Specifically, 713 people tested positive for swine flu, 47 for A(H3), also known as Hong Kong flu, and 223 for influenza B virus. Since the end of the second wave of Covid in 2021, health authorities across Nepal have stopped active case finding, including contact tracing and free testing. Hospitals now only conduct tests for those seeking polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests for travel abroad or for seriously ill patients with respiratory conditions. Multiple doctors the Post spoke with said that the circulation of coronavirus has never stopped and will not stop in coming days either.Infectious disease experts and virologists urge the public to take precautions to protect the elderly and people with comorbidity from the deadly virus. “Testing and other preventive measures have stopped,” an official at the Health Ministry said, asking not to be named, as he is not authorised to speak on the issue. “But just look around: in our homes and neighbourhood, we can easily find cases of fever, common cold and people with other Covid-like symptoms.”Experts say that even if people are not getting severe from Covid infection, the elderly and people with underlying conditions remain at high risk.“We saw elderly people requiring intensive care during the previous surge in April,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of the Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital. “It’s time to return to basics—washing hands, wearing face masks, avoiding crowds—in order to save at-risk groups like the elderly and those with underlying conditions.”Experts say the overall high positivity rate suggests the virus has spread faster than expected. There could be many people with Covid who have not gone for tests, according to them.As the coronavirus symptoms are similar to those of seasonal flu, many opt not to get tested, which doctors say could prove costly, because they can be carriers and could spread the virus to those coming in contact.Doctors warn that authorities’ reactive approach—taking preventive measures only after hospitals start witnessing massive patient flow could result in more severe consequences.Meanwhile, a highly placed source at the Health Ministry confirmed detection of a new sub-variant of the coronavirus in the country apart from previous variants including the Covid sub-lineages KP.1, KP.2, KP.3, and KP.4.The National Public Health Laboratory had recently carried out whole-genome sequencing on swab samples of 42 coronavirus-infected persons. The report is expected to be published on Tuesday.Whole-genome sequencing is a comprehensive method of analysing the entire DNA sequence of an organism’s genes. Researchers believe whole-genome sequencing of coronavirus could be instrumental in tracking the virus’s severity and properties.“The trend of previous years shows infection of influenza virus including coronavirus surge in August and September,” said Dr Ranjan Bhatta, director at the NPHL. “This surge has been seen in recent days as well. But this does not mean you should panic, only that you should take enough precautions against the risk.” \nAt the Dhulikhel Hospital in Kavrepalanchok, the suggestion box is overflowing with complaints of rude behaviour.People are unhappy not only with doctors, nurses and paramedics serving at the hospital, but also with security guards, administrative staff and those manning the hospital’s ticket counter.“Sometimes, the behaviour of health workers and other staffers towards patients and their visitors escalates and leads to conflicts,” said Dr Biraj Karmacharya, administrative head of the Hospital. “The issue is not just the complaints made by the patients and their visitors, hospital officials have also noticed behavioural problems among health workers and other staffers.”To address growing complaints from patients and visitors, the hospital administration has decided to impart behavioural and communication skills training to its entire staffers, including doctors, nurses, paramedics and others.Officials hope this training will help lessen the growing grievances.“Proper communication and good behaviour are essential for all hospital staff including doctors,” said Dr Karmacharya. “These skills are also taught in universities and medical courses, but it seems some health workers have not paid much attention to these basics. Patients and their visitors should be treated like a hotel treats its guests.”Experts say complaints about rude behaviour are not only limited to any particular hospital but are prevalent across almost all hospitals in Nepal. Due to a lack of proper communication and behavioural skills, reports of scuffles between hospitals or doctors and the relatives of deceased patients take place frequently. Sometimes, these situations also take a nasty turn and doctors have been manhandled and hospitals vandalised. These disputes have also escalated into shutdown of the healthcare facilities, protests by health workers, and a halt in services.“Colleges under the Tribhuvan University’s Institute of Medicine teach communication skills to the students of medicine,” said Dr Jagdish Prasad Agrawal, retired dean of the Institute of Medicine. “Although communication skills are part of the curriculum and a basic requirement for any health professional, it seems that many have not paid much attention to these skills.”Good communication skills and respectful behaviour are crucial for health workers, regardless of their other profession skills, officials at the Nepal Medical Council, the national regulatory body of medical doctors, said.They said that health workers can foster a positive environment in hospitals and improve interactions with patients and their relatives. “People in every profession need good communication skills, and those serving in the medical sector need them the most,” said Dr Bishwa Raj Dawadi, member of the Council. “The Council often receives complaints about doctors’ rude behaviour.”The council has made professional development training that includes communication skills mandatory for all medical doctors. Failure to attend the course will lead to non-renewal of the medical licence.As per the council’s rule, medical doctors must undertake this training regularly. The council assesses the effectiveness of the training every five years to ensure that medical doctors are up-to-date in their profession.Patients have to wait in long queues in state-run health facilities to see a doctor. Visitors of every patient expect immediate care, as they think that the problems of their patients are more serious than others’. Dawadi said that the success of health workers depends not only on the care they provide but also on their communication with patients.“To lessen risk of getting assaulted or mistreated by patients and their visitors, health workers, including doctors, must be good communicators,” said Dawadi. “Other hospitals should also provide communication and behaviour training to their staff.” \nNearly 60 percent of drinking water samples collected from various places of Lalitpur district—Lalitpur Metropolitan City, Godawari and Mahalaxmi municipalities—are found to be contaminated with faecal coliform.Officials at the Health Office, Lalitpur said that drinking water samples were collected from the local units following an outbreak of cholera in recent weeks.“Out of 12 samples of drinking water collected for quality checks, faecal coliform was found in seven,” said Shree Bhadra Sharma, a lab technician at the Lalitpur health office. “We have started chlorinating drinking water at the sources and have taken other measures to prevent further spread of waterborne diseases, including cholera.”Faecal coliform, a microscopic organism, lives in the intestines of warm-blooded animals or in their faeces. The presence of faecal coliform indicates that the drinking water being used by the residents of Thaiba in Godawari Municipality in Lalitpur is contaminated with sewage, according to doctors.Of the 30 cholera cases reported from across the country, 19 were from various areas of Lalitpur and the remaining from Kailali (8), Kathmandu (1) and Pyuthan (2).Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, leading to dehydration and or even death within a few hours if untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient.Faecal coliform had also been detected in the study carried out on water samples collected from Godawari Municipality before the onset of monsoon.As the monsoon is an epidemic season, when most drinking water sources become contaminated due to flooding, presence of deadly microbes—E coli and faecal coliform—in drinking water is not unusual, health officials say. Even jar water, which is generally considered safer compared to water from other sources, often gets contaminated during the monsoon season.What concerns officials most is the apathy of the responsible agencies in launching awareness drives about the risks and other preventive measures. Most local authorities across the country halted testing of drinking water just before the start of monsoon citing budget constraints.Officials at the Kathmandu Upatyaka Khanepani Limited (KUKL) said that it is the responsibility of consumers themselves to ensure that water is safe before drinking, as the utility cannot guarantee the safety of drinking from every tap.“We request consumers to boil water properly before drinking, as water gets contaminated during the monsoon season due to leakage in pipes and mixing of drainage and rainwater,” said Sailaja Acharya, assistant manager of the KUKL. “We have increased the level of chlorine at the treatment plant and in reservoirs, but water could get contaminated when it reaches household taps.”The KUKL has started supplying water from the Bagmati river to household taps after supply from the Melamchi River was halted. Officials said that water from the Bagmati River gets chlorinated before being supplied to household taps. Doctors say consumption of contaminated water not only can cause diarrhoeal infections and deadly cholera but also increases the risk of contracting dysentery, typhoid, and hepatitis A and E.They stress that awareness drives and ensuring safe drinking water are the only ways to protect people from water-borne diseases. A combination of careful surveys, provision of safe drinking water, good sanitation and hygiene standards, social mobilisation and treatment is required to contain the spread of infection, according to doctors. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nThe noise of ever-growing traffic, the breaking and mending of black-topped roads, and an ever-expanding concrete jungle are some features that one would associate with the Kathmandu Valley.It is a wildly growing urban forest quickly transforming into a busy metropolis where every inch of space is ready to be sold and built. Yet, pockets of the past remain—small, peaceful neighbourhoods where houses are still made of wood, paths are made of stone tiles, and the stillness of a world that wants to stay intact and immobile. These places are known for tourism, culture, and the restoration of community pride. One such stop is the quiet village of Khokana in southern Lalitpur.Khokana is comparatively close to the mainland urban Lalitpur; from the ring road junction of Bagdole, it takes only a 10-minute drive to reach there. From the airport, you can take a cab directly to Khokana, which will take around half an hour. Get your cameras and hiking boots ready; the area is filled with historical artefacts and hiking trails.However, it is vastly different from the city. It is much nearer to the hills, where stone-paved paths, which could easily be goat trails, are rare in today’s Kathmandu.One such goat trail leads to Sikali temple, a major attraction of the area and accessible only on foot. The pavements are lined with big and small temples on each side, along with ponds that serve as clean water sources and a location for religious rituals. The houses are made of bricks and wood. The concrete invasion, although present, is minimal. Scattered every few hundred metres are small mustard oil mills, co-operative businesses of the locals of Khokana that have existed since medieval times.A site well-recognised for its historical significance, Khokana was even proposed to be made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. Sikali TempleAround an hour’s walk from the historic town, Sikali Temple can be reached, which is also the location for its famed Sikali Jatra.While it can be reached through any public vehicle, a more holistic and adventurous route is to follow the goat trails on the outskirts of Khokana. This route, albeit long, allows for great hiking opportunities, scenic views of the hills surrounding the Kathmandu Valley, and a close-up view of the mediaeval but well-maintained architecture of the local houses.Even if you lose the way, which is very possible, the locals are very welcoming and more than willing to guide you. The main temple itself is three stories tall, and built in the Pagoda style, a common style in many temples in the valley.It is surrounded by a lush grass field which plays the stage to the Sikali Jatra held every year. The temple, like many religious spots around Khokana, is dedicated to the local deity Shree Rudrayani.The Sikali Jatra, a five-day festival that serves as an alternative to Dashain for the Khokana locals, is filled with chariot dances, battle enactments, and storytelling celebrations in the worship of Goddess Rudrayani.Starting from Ghatasthapana in mid to late September, the Jatra is vibrant and an essential experience for every visitor. Historical Khokana townKhokana’s historical town is located around 5 minutes walking distance from the local bus park. The town complex, paved with hand-made stone tiles, is graced with the Indrayanee temple but also has many red-bricked houses built in the local Newari architecture, some of them centuries old.One such house is the ‘Khokana Museum’. Although closed, it is widely popular for being the first house to be lit with electricity in Nepal, as Chandra Shamsher did in 1911.The stand-holder of the first light bulb can still be seen, serving as a historical monument for everyone to see.Similarly, the town complex is also filled with Guthi houses, small ponds, and even the local Ward office. While the Ward office provides a wealth of information for visitors interested in the area’s history, the Guthi halls symbolise the strong community support culture of the locals.The ponds, a notable one present right opposite the Indrayanee temple, have stone taps and remind us of primitive ways of obtaining clean water—a practice many locals are still engaged in.Yet, these ponds are also religious locations, especially used in rituals in the Sikali Jatra.Finally, a stroll through the complex allows visitors to explore old houses and historical artefacts in the serene quietness of Khokana, while the small outlets and Choila places nearby allow you to enjoy the spicy duck or chicken delicacies at the same time.Overall, the historical complex is enough to transport visitors back to a glimpse of the medieval past of the Kathmandu Valley. Mustard oil millsThe most well-known feature of Khokana is its mustard oil mills, which have been operational for hundreds of years and have been using the same methods of preparation since their inception.These mills, scattered throughout Khokana, are often community-owned, and even the ones owned by certain individuals have almost exclusively employed locals.Despite the advent of modern machinery, there is still substantial demand for their products due to the assured guarantee.When I visited one such mill, the local staff informed me that the furnace and oil presser used by them were 300 years old, given by the Patan royalty even before the Shahs became king.In addition to buying pure, organically created mustard oil and pellets, visiting these oil mills offers many educational benefits for international and local tourists alike.Khokana offers visitors a unique glimpse into a preserved bubble of the past through its tranquillity, preservation of ancient lifestyle and cultural elements, and remarkable self-sustenance.  \n“How much oxygen do you have for the summit?”I think this is the kind of question a film producer would ask. But when you're on the mountain, the answer is never clear.I have worked for a long time in the film industry and different art areas, especially photography and engraving.Working in various fields and drawing inspiration from them has become a new normal for me. I have made this approach my way of life without even realising it.I took responsibility for producing the last movie I worked on and shot the behind-the-scenes footage for a documentary. By doing so, I witnessed the entire shooting process and the journey of a movie.In the snowy highlands of Turkey, we had to endure the consequences of the changing climate to shoot ‘About Dry Grasses’, directed by Nuri Bilge Ceylan. The highlands used to be snowy in January, but by the time we got there in the same month, there was no snow. Nature was changing. It was responding to what was happening—to what humanity had done to it. In the end, it snowed, and we shot the intense snow scenes we wanted. But since most of our days were sunny, unlike what the director wanted, we had to shoot in the sunset and sunrise hours. As crew members, we spent many days waiting for the sun to set.Production requires creating opportunities, finding solutions, and being creative for a work of art to come true. For this, patience, endurance, calmness, and timing are necessary. On the other hand, nature wanted us to listen to it and wait for the right time.During that time, I witnessed many of nature's lessons. For example, I experienced extreme cold for the first time. We endured temperatures ranging from -33 degrees to +55 degrees. By listening to nature, surrendering to its forces, and working within its limits, we managed to persevere.No matter how much you prepare or plan during the pre-production phase, if you are working in nature, remember that nature will always have the final say.The film was completed, released, and connected with audiences. Its success at Cannes 2023 was followed by my trip to the North Pole for my project. I returned with a mix of wonderful developments, joys, and challenges. During this process, I experienced life and death, happiness and sadness, losses and awards.I realised the value of being able to breathe comfortably a few days after my father's chemotherapy ended. Just a few days earlier, he had said, \"Well done, my daughter. I'm glad you went!\" All the anxiety and hard work, filled with fears at the beginning, were finally behind me.Before going to Everest, when I was on the verge of giving up, defeated by my fears, I remembered my father's words. Everest reminded me of what he said while struggling to breathe, adding a turning point to my life.What does it mean to say ‘life’s turning point?’ How many turning points can there be in life?Who am I, and what am I doing in this world? How well do I know my own limits? Can I find answers to these big questions? These thoughts sparked my dream of journeying to Everest. Now, after returning, I can say that it turned my life around.“How much oxygen do you need for the summit?” sounds more like “How much do you need to hold on to life?” How many reasons do you find that give meaning to your life, keep you alive, and allow you to breathe? How much can you endure in the face of obstacles, and can you keep believing that a solution will eventually come your way?Can these questions be separated from the idea of measuring and assessing something, from learning its quantity and financial value? Can everything be known with certainty? Should the journey be fully understood in advance, with all its promises laid out? Should it be viewed like a purchase with a price tag, asking, “Is this journey worth this much?”I had never trekked before and had no climbing experience. I had lived at sea level my entire life and had never been to a high altitude.However, this journey was not only about the physical climb but also an inner discovery. After losing my father to lung cancer, his breathing difficulties taught me the fragility of breath, life, and existence. I also mentally prepared myself for the physical challenges I might face. Despite all my concerns, could this journey help me understand the cycle of life and the resilience of the soul?So, how could I make this trek possible? How could I land in Nepal? Despite all the economic difficulties and the many things I felt needed organising, I did my best and believed in it.Since I was embarking on this journey, I felt I should share about my travels and inspire others.Starting with photography, cinema, and engraving, which are already integral parts of my life, I dreamed of documenting and sharing the inspiring aspects of this journey.After months of correspondence and dreaming, it all came true. Finally, I embarked on the journey with the goal of creating photographs, engravings, and documentaries. I learned a great deal from my travels in Nepal, from the people I met, and from every moments I witnessed. I felt incredibly fortunate to have been able to honour my father’s memory with the peace and serenity I experienced in the Himalayas.During my 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp, I encountered nature’s masterpieces at every turn. As concerns like “How will I endure?” and “How will I finish?” started to weigh on me, the mountains suddenly parted with the clouds and gazed down at me.It was amazing to witness the appearance of ‘Gods’ that I had never seen before, in such immense size and in such a close, awe-inspiring manner beside me during that silent walk.As someone who came from one of the most crowded cities in the world, Istanbul, while I struggled with my daily questions and uncertainties, trying to control everything, they stood there calmly, as if answering me.They were just there—before and after.My guide, Lakhpa Sherpa, always reminded me not to worry about how high we were, how long it would take to reach our accommodation, or what the weather would be like. He encouraged me to live in the moment, and he was right.He advised me to focus on my breathing, not to get thirsty, to eat enough, and to appreciate the extraordinary beauty of the journey. In the mountains, plans dissolve and each moment is embraced as it comes.All the good wishes, prayers, and everything encountered along the way were for the journey itself. The mountain was full of life, secrets, and everything I had wondered about.This 15-day journey to Everest Base Camp was a solo adventure, yet I wouldn't have been able to complete it without my guide, Lhakpa, and my porter. Additionally, I was fortunate enough to experience the hospitality, generosity, and honesty at Trekkers Paradise, which organised the entire journey and provided guidance.I witnessed how dedication and sincerity are crucial in completing a journey safely and healthily. Ghanshyam Sharma, from Trekkers Paradise and Sauraj Jhingan, a climber who summited the Everest in 2018, shared their experiences with me during the journey.They experienced the 2015 earthquake while they were at the Everest Base Camp.As a filmmaker, their role as actors, and attention to detail played a significant role in bringing my dream photography and documentary project to life.The sponsors of my journey were Turkish Airlines, The North Face, Apple, Canon, and Stanley. My supporters include Oscar International College and Nepal Film Campus. Throughout the journey, I shared many experiences, memories, and countless photos and images with my students.On my way back home after 21 days, I celebrated my birthday on the plane. From the right window, the Himalayas bid me farewell. I felt like I had opened a new chapter in my life, and I was certain that I would return.I had made many friends and memories in Nepal.For now, I will be working on a documentary and preparing for a photography and engraving exhibition titled ‘My Soul Beyond the Mountain’.To the Himalayas: This summer was spent with you, but we will meet again soon. \nWe spent five days in Sri Lanka two weeks ago, driving up and down the island, covering almost 70 percent of its territory. Our tour spanned over 1,000 kilometres, including hills, beach spots, and heritage and religious sites.Our first stop in Sri Lanka was Colombo’s Bandaranaike International Airport. We were greeted by a warm and humid breeze when we exited the airport. The host briefed us (a group of journalists) that heavy rainfall has affected areas across Sri Lanka since mid-May 2024. Rain and storms intensified on June 1, with the most significant effects in the south and west of the country. We were lucky to have no rain in the forecast.On the first night, we checked into the lavish Jetwing Lake resort, an opulent sanctuary amidst the lush landscape. The resort’s expansive grounds were a retreat, offering a glimpse of Sri Lanka's natural beauty. We feasted on delicious cuisine, every bite exploding with flavour, introducing us to the island’s famed culinary delights. On June 7, early morning, the sun shone brightly, previewing the promise of an incredible journey ahead. We set off early the following day, eager to explore the mysteries of this enchanting island. As we ventured further into the heart of Sri Lanka, the landscape revealed its majestic nature. We were astounded by seeing Pidurangala Rock, a 200-metre-high granite colossus just a kilometre north of Sigiriya. The short hike to Pidurangala Rock offered breathtaking views of Sigiriya and beyond. We climbed the steep steps and soon were rewarded with a breathtaking panoramic view of the surrounding landscape. It took us 30 minutes to climb. The sight took our breaths away and left us humbled in the presence of such grandeur. From the top are glorious vistas of the surrounding landscape and an incredible view of the majestic Sigiriya Rock. From there, Sigiriya Lion’s Rock is visible, standing alone. This was the place where demon king Ravana had his palace in the Treta Yuga. Believed to have been built 50 centuries ago, the palace is said to have had a unique lift for Ravana and his visitors. Ravana imprisoned Sita in one of the caves at the bottom of this humongous boulder. Sigiriya is a fifth-century fortress in Sri Lanka carved out of an inselberg, a hill of hard volcanic rock that soared high above the surrounding jungle. We spent two hours atop the rock, mainly taking photographs. We descended from Pidurangala Rock, filled with awe and a sense of accomplishment.The journey ahead seemed even more enticing as we ventured along the winding roads, heading towards our next destination.Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022, with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70 percent, its currency to record lows, and its economy contracting 7.3 percent.Thanks to the growing number of tourists, Sri Lanka is now bouncing back.In Jetwing Lake, we met Kasun Pradeep Somasiri, a receptionist. He briefed us that the resort is now 50 percent occupied. “That’s a better figure now as we are recovering.”The travel and tourism sector is a significant income generator for Sri Lanka. However, the economic crisis, the Ukraine–Russia war, and China’s zero-Covid policy have jeopardised the industry.Tourism accounted for more than 12 percent of the country’s GDP in 2019 and was the third-largest source of foreign exchange reserves, behind worker remittances and the apparel industry.Sri Lanka was poised to be one of the world’s best holiday destinations due to its rich culture, wealth of natural resources, and diversity of accessible experiences.However, tourism-dependent Sri Lanka suffered its first major setback with the Easter bombings 2019. This led to the collapse of inbound tourism flows as international arrivals declined by 18 percent year-on-year, and tourist expenditure fell by 17.7 percent that year. This was immediately followed by two years of pandemic restrictions. Inbound visitors fell to just 116,600 in 2021.An acute balance of payments crisis forced Sri Lanka to preemptively default on foreign debt of over $50 billion in April 2022, triggering a crippling economic contraction with spiralling inflation.“Tourism is gaining momentum,” says Somasiri. “The British and Chinese have started to return to Sri Lanka.”January-August is the peak season for foreigners. “From December to April, local people travel for holiday purposes,” says Somasiri. Before we started the tour to other religious sites, our tour guide, Sampath Mayadunne, told us, “Don't take selfies with your back to Buddha.” Turning your back on a Buddha statue and some other religious sites to take photos and videos is a strict no-no.The most common sight across Sri Lanka is the tank cascades system, an ancient irrigation infrastructure. The system is a network of small tanks draining to large reservoirs that store rainwater and surface runoff for later use.“These infrastructures were built by its ancient kings over 2,000 years ago to solve the water scarcity in the country’s dry zone,” says Mayadunne.On day two, we travelled to Ranweli Spice Garden in Matale. This garden is famous for its rare spices and herbs. A tour of the gardens will show you the cultivation, harvesting, cleaning, and packaging process, as well as the health benefits and uses of the herbs.On the way, we saw a colourful Muthumariamman Hindu temple, boasting hundreds of detailed sculptures in a rich mosaic of colour.In Kandy, we visited the Temple of the Tooth Relic (Sri Dalada Maligawa), one of the most sacred places of worship in the Buddhist world. It was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1988.The temple sustained damage from bombings by Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna in 1989 and by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in 1998. However, it was fully restored each time.We then headed to Jetwing St Andrew’s, a luxurious 5-star property in Sri Lanka’s hill country of Nuwara Eliya, situated at 1,900 metres above sea level. During our stay in Kandy, we immersed ourselves in the city's charm and the serenity of the countryside. On the third day, early morning, we travelled to Nuwara Eliya, the area famous for tea estates that give many Nepalis the feeling that they have come to Kanyam, Ilam, in eastern Nepal.We visited a tea factory called Damro Labookellie Tea Centre, the oldest tea centre in Sri Lanka. Due to its cold climate, it is the most important area for tea production in Sri Lanka.In this tea factory, they make white and black tea, while the green tea is processed in another tea factory and then sent to Damro.After the tea factory tour and the tea tasting, we headed to Galle, our next resting point.We encountered narrow, winding, and maze-like streets and alleys in Nuwara Eliya, known as ‘Little England’. The town has preserved almost all its British-era buildings and is calm and beautiful. On our way to Galle, at the roadside, our tour guide stopped us at the famed Sita temple, which has Hanuman's footprints and is the place where Sita, wife of Lord Rama, was held captive by the demon king Ravana after he abducted her from India.We were at Sita Eliya, a temple named Sri Seethai Amman.When we reached the Hindu temple, rich in vibrant colours and architectural elements, it was full of devotees. The water stream adjoining the temple is believed to be where Sita bathed. Large footprints are found on the stones in the stream, and there is a saying that those belong to Hanuman, who came spying to find Sita’s whereabouts.In Ella, Ravana’s waterfalls are significant in the Rama-Ravana story. The cascade charms visitors from all over the globe. The waterfall is easily accessible and is known to have hidden caves at the top, which are believed to have been used as Ravana's residence.The 25-metre-tall waterfall is a beautiful cascade that provides the perfect backdrop for a photo to remember your Ramayana trail adventures in Sri Lanka. A short pilgrimage tour ended there, and it was now time for an adventure. Though it was not part of our itinerary, our guide decided to tour us on a train ride.Though short, only six kilometres from Ella to Demodera, it was thrilling. Everyone screamed in unison like kids on a fair ride to hear the echoes in the dark every time we passed through the tunnels. The sound of the train is subtly different inside a tunnel. For the first-timer, the darkness and shouts inside the tunnels when the train passes would be scary, like a horror movie.The train we boarded wasn’t crowded, but people had already filled the doorway, ready for the scenic journey.With the shrill sound of a whistle, the train slowly pulled away from the platform at Ella, passing houses, coconut trees and green fields.As the train progressed, tourists and locals were leaning out the windows and crowding to hang out the doors. I joined the crowd and hung out on a train. A short excitement ended there.After lunch, we headed to Galle and reached Jetwing Lighthouse. As soon as our group entered the hotel, they shouted with excitement.The hotel is on a rocky outcrop three miles west of Galle. Waves crash over giant boulders in front of it and produce howling winds.We were at Galle’s 17th-century fort five minutes from the hotel on day four. In the Bay of Galle on the southwest coast of Sri Lanka, Galle Fort was built first in 1588 by the Portuguese and lavishly rebuilt by the Dutch during the 17th century. It is a historical, archaeological and architectural heritage monument that maintains a perfect appearance even after more than 436 years.We then reached Hikkaduwa Beach, a popular beach destination on the southern coast of Sri Lanka. On the way, we saw a 30-metre-high Big Buddha Statue. It is a replica of the 6th-century Buddhas of Bamiyan destroyed by the Taliban in Afghanistan. It was created using the earliest known sketches of the statue. It was built in remembrance of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami victims.We then travelled through the 222-kilometre-long Southern Expressway, Sri Lanka's first expressway linking the capital, Colombo, with Galle, Matara, and Hambantota, significant cities south of the island.On day five, we reached Colombo, the capital of Sri Lanka. Jetwing Colombo Seven hosted us in the bustling capital. We took a city tour early morning and visited Bally's Casino at night.On day six, we returned to Kathmandu early in the morning on a Sri Lankan Airlines flight, the airline that organised the trip in coordination with Jetwing Hotels Limited, a Sri Lankan hotel chain.National flag carrier Nepal Airlines, in its previous avatar as Royal Nepal Airlines, used to operate direct flights to Colombo during the 1980s. However, the carrier suspended operations following an armed movement by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in Sri Lanka. There had been no direct air links between the two countries for decades.In 2016, Himalaya Airlines started a chartered flight that lasted a few months due to low traffic movement between the two countries. Sri Lankan Airlines started operating direct flights to Kathmandu in August 2021.“The main objective of this media tour is to increase tourism in both countries for mutual benefit. We want to draw Nepalis for pilgrims and leisure activities,” says Nilina Pathirana, Country Manager at Srilankan Airlines in Nepal.“We have understood that Nepali travellers tend to travel to Bangkok, Vietnam, Malaysia, Dubai, and Maldives. Nepalis have quite minimal knowledge about Sri Lanka and the religious connection between Lanka and Nepal. We want to promote Nepal and Sri Lanka jointly. This will be a win-win business,” added Pathirana.The airline said it currently carries 60 percent of the passengers from Nepal to Sri Lanka and beyond destinations like Tokyo, Sydney, Melbourne, and other Middle Eastern destinations. The return airfare for a 3.5-hour-long flight starts at Rs74,000. “We have a four-night, five-day package that begins from Rs80,000, depending on the properties and extended itineraries,” says Pathirana.Nepalis must submit certain required documents for visa processing, like their passport copy and bank statement. Due to this government-to-government policy, only Nepalis must obtain a prior visa. Otherwise, Sri Lankans are required to have a visa upon arrival.“The other best thing is that Sri Lankan Airlines can be involved with the visa process or facilitate the Nepalis tourists. Our main intention is to have a sustainable market in Kathmandu and make it a daily flight,” says Pathirana. \nMundhum Trek in Koshi province in the eastern part of Nepal is a new cultural walking trail. It passes through several indigenous ethnic villages and landscapes in Khotang and Bhojpur districts. This trail goes up to an elevation of 4,200 metres to the viewpoint of Silchung Peak and takes one through the settlements of the Kirati people. This route starts from Diktel Bazaar and passes through beautiful settlements like Chakhewa, Rawa Dhap, Salpa Bhanjyang, Silchung and Hanspokhari before ending in Bhojpur. There are some hotels in Diktel but trekkers are advised to carry tents. The trail offers panoramic views of most of the eight-thousanders, including Everest, Lhotse, Makalu, Cho Oyu and Kanchenjunga mountains. The spring season, March through May, is highly recommended for the trek.Janaki Mandir Janaki Mandir at Janakpur in Madhesh province was constructed in 1874 and is a blend of Mughal and local architecture. The temple is a three-storey building and has 60 rooms, making it the largest temple in Nepal. Pilgrims flock here by the thousands to pay homage to Janaki Mandir—Janaki being the other name of Sita, the daughter of King Janak. The temple houses an idol of Sita which was found near Ayodhya, the kingdom of Ram. The marriage anniversary of Lord Ram and Sita is celebrated in Janakpur every year on Vivaha Panchami, which falls in December. In the southwest corner of Janaki Mandir is the Vivaha Mandap, which has been built at the site where the marriage of Ram and Sita is said to have taken place. Another well-known temple in the vicinity is Ram Mandir, which is built in pagoda style and is hence different from the other temples in Janakpur that generally bear resemblance to Mughal architecture. It houses a female statue, said to be of Yogamaya, which has the reputation of being one of the most beautiful images of female forms in Nepal. Other holy sites of interest include the Laxman Temple, Sankat Mochan Temple and Hanuman Temple.Kuri Village, Kalinchok Kuri village, a popular tourist destination around 150 km from Kathmandu, lies at an altitude of 3,842 metres above sea level in Kalinchowk of Dolakha district, in Bagmati province. People visit the place to enjoy the snow during the winter besides the mesmerising landscapes and splendid panoramic view of the Himalayan range. Kalinchok gets snow mainly at the end of December and the snowfall continues till the end of February or mid-March. When there is snow, it is difficult for jeeps, buses and cars to reach the top of Kuri village. Chains are wrapped around the wheels of vehicles and specially modified jeeps with highly experienced drivers are used to carry visitors. There are several hotels and restaurants in the area. The road up to Kuri has also improved over the years.Annapurna Base Camp Annapurna Base Camp trek, in Gandaki province, makes for a picturesque journey that takes you to the foothills of the Annapurna South, up to 4,130 metres above sea level. The five-day trek (seven days for slow walkers) offers rich cultural diversities, typical Nepali villages and the flora and fauna nestled at the foothills of Annapurna. The distance from Pokhara to Annapurna Base Camp is approximately 81 kilometres. It is among the shortest and most budget-friendly treks in Nepal. For Nepalis, lodging costs around $5 to $10 per day. For foreigners, the overall cost of the trek ranges from $800 to $1500 on average per person. Annapurna Base Camp trek can be done at any time throughout the year as each season offers a different trekking experience. The ideal time for the trek depends on your weather preferences and what you expect from it. However, autumn (September to October) and spring (March to May) are considered the two best seasons for the trek, as the days at the time are warm and bright with clear skies.Bardiya National Park Bardiya National Park, located in the southern Tarai belt of Lumbini province, is home to one of the most elusive and majestic animals on earth—the Royal Bengal Tiger. The park, which covers an area of 968 square kilometres, is considered one of the most important protected areas in the country. It is a prime destination for those looking to catch a glimpse of a tiger. A bit of luck and patience will offer a good chance to see the Bengal Tiger. The jungle safari also offers one the opportunity to spot Asian elephants and the greater one-horned rhinoceros. The rare Gangetic river dolphins are occasionally spotted on rafting trips along the Geruwa River, the eastern channel of the Karnali river. Besides, visitors can enjoy the homestays and explore local Tharu culture. The right time to visit the park is from mid-September to mid-December and mid-February to May.Khaptad National Park Khaptad National Park in Sudurpaschim province is a protected area in the far western region. It stretches over four districts of Bajhang, Bajura, Achham and Doti and ranges in elevation from 1,400 to 3,300 metres. The park can be visited throughout the year. Trekkers are advised to bring their tents, food and other supplies. The Nepal Tourism Board says of late, social media has been increasingly influencing Nepali travellers to go to Khaptad. Since the far-flung Khaptad National Park is still offbeat for many travellers, the area remains pristine and fresh. The seasons of spring (March-May) and autumn (October-November) are the ideal times to visit the park. The temperature ranges from 10°c to 20°c offering pleasant trekking weather. The monsoon begins in June and lasts until September and during this time, roads often become muddy and slippery. From December to February, winter brings snow and chilling winds to the park.Limi Valley \nOnce again, my heart swelled with joy when my hometown came into view.Arriving at Lalikharka after the treacherous journey through Pauwa Bhanjyang and the bustling Kanchhi Dokan, Phidim, the headquarters of Panchthar district, revealed itself like a surprise gift. My home town, Phidim, is unique in the fact that it reveals to travellers approaching it from uphill. As the vehicle descends the mountain road, it slowly comes into view, its houses and buildings recognisable for the native son.This Dashain, I undertook the much-awaited trip to my hometown with my wife Kabita and daughter Aarohi. Little did I anticipate the transformation that awaited me.The moment I got out of the jeep, I noticed that Phidim, nestled in the lush hills, has undergone a remarkable transformation over the years. As I guided my family to my home, which had suffered damages in the 1989 quake that struck eastern Nepal, I found that old, mud and stone houses had been replaced by concrete buildings. The place was vastly different from the one I remembered.Arriving at my childhood home felt like reuniting with an old friend. Navigating its nooks and crannies with my daughter, we delved into the history of the house, a symbol of my cherished memories.My wife had visited Phidim years ago, spending a month with my parents. She, too, recalled beautiful moments she had had in the town. I asked the tenant about the neighbours and acquaintances. Some had died, while others had left for good.A call to local journalist Giriraj Banskota led me to the school grounds, where memories flooded back. This was where I spent my teenage years, playing ball, learning to kick, and watching major tournaments. Here, I even encountered a group of Western climbers headed to Kanchenjunga, the world’s third-highest mountain. I remember being awed by their shiny yellow tents, headlights and strange smell. I remember practising my tutephuteko Angrezi with the climbers. Birendra Shield, an annual sports tournament named after the late king, brought ace players from various schools in Panchthar district. The district also hosted Yuba Mela, an annual three-day fair to commemorate the birthday of the king, organising football tournaments in which teams from as far as Sunsari and Taplejung participated. I never excelled at dribbling balls. A boy growing up in a seven-member family, I soon found my interest in literature. In the late 1980s, Phidim hosted a major literary festival. In the run-up to the 1990 pro-democracy protest, walls were painted with anti-monarchy slogans, local politicians were arrested. I took my family to my school, Naya Namuna Secondary School. It was Saturday, so the school was closed. I peeked through the steel gate and wall, imagining myself labouring over classes. Memories are hazy, but what I remember most is going out of the school—to quiz contests with me leading the school team, to essay competitions at the District Education Office and to play carom board, a national pastime, in a nearby shopfront. Returning to the main street, the demolition of a landmark gate made me reflect on how cities transform, shedding old landmarks for new identities. Navigating narrow alleyways, I felt like a stranger in my own hometown. Multistory buildings have emerged and roads have been paved, reshaping the town. It’s the same place with a different face, leaving me nostalgic for the Phidim of my memories.We finally reached Shivalaya temple, which I told my wife and daughter was one of my cherished hangouts. A giant statue of Falgunanda (the Kirant leader’s birthday is celebrated on November 10) stood before the steps to the temple. Though my wife suspected I came here to smoke, in reality, I visited the temple in the evening to meet friends and talk about issues that mattered most to us at the time. It also offered a panoramic view of the town (I could not take my family to Gadhi Danda, a hillock across the Shivalaya).Towards the end of my journey, I felt sad about Phidim’s lack of prospects. To my dismay, I found that people have been leaving the town in droves. Despite blacktopped roads and multi-story buildings, Phidim faces a troubling reality. The lack of quality higher education and specialist healthcare has driven people away, echoing the circumstances that led me to Kathmandu years ago. Conversations with locals confirmed a mass exodus from the town, a trend that raises concerns about Phidim's future.My conversations with familiar strangers led me to conclude that Phidim has transformed into a transit town for pilgrims heading to Pathibhara Devi Temple, which is around 255 kilometres north in Taplejung district. I met dozens of people headed to the holy site. While pilgrims see it as a stopover, for me, it was a homecoming. The realisation dawned that Phidim is, perhaps, in a state of transition, trading its rustic charm for the hallmarks of urbanisation. While I left Phidim for higher education in Kathmandu, people from rural areas have flocked to the town in search of better opportunities, bringing life and energy to the once quiet community.As we bid adieu to my hometown, I couldn’t help but reflect on the inevitability of leaving a place, no matter how enamoured one is with it. Passing Kanchhi Dokan, I pointed out Kanchnajungha and Kumbhakarna to my daughter—symbols of my childhood. Phidim, now a blend of nostalgia and change, remains etched in my heart, a testament to the intricate dance between memory and evolution. \nNepal Sports Journalists Forum (NSJF) on Wednesday announced that the 21st edition of the NSJF Pulsar Sports Award will be held on September 13 at the Nepal Academy Hall in Kathmandu.Organising a press conference, NSJF extended the sponsorship deal with main sponsor Golchha Group for yet another year.This is the 16th edition in a row that Golchha Group has been sponsoring the annual Sports Award, which began in 2003.NSJF President Durga Nath Subedi (Devendra) and Golchha Group Director Abhimanyu Golchha penned the sponsorship deal on Wednesday.As per the agreement, Golchha Group will provide N Series’ Pulsar NS 400 two-wheeler, which the Golchha group is launching in Nepal soon, to one award winner, while four NS 200 two-wheelers will be awarded to four others winners.Golchha Group will also provide Rs1.2 million to the NSJF, the umbrella organisation of sports journalists in the country.“Pulsar motorcycles align with the speed, capability, and spirit of athletes,” Director Golchha said. “We are confident that the recognition we have extended to the players has significantly contributed to the advancement of the sports sector.”According to the organisers, the NSJF will also host the Congress of the Asian Sports Journalists Federation (AIPS Asia) in conjunction with the Awards ceremony. The Congress is scheduled to take place from September 10 to 13, with participation from sports journalists representing 33 Asian countries. The NSJF is an active member of the International Sports Press Association (AIPS) Asia.“Journalists from across Asia will have the opportunity to witness this prestigious award ceremony this year,” remarked President Subedi.This year, NSJF will recognise athletes and sports professionals in ten categories—Male Player of the Year, Female Player of the Year, Coach of the Year, Youth Player of the Year, Team of the Year, People's Choice Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Para Athlete Honour, Special Award, and the Asian Sports Journalist Award.Winners in the Male Player, Female Player, Youth Player, Coach of the Year, and People's Choice Award categories will receive motorcycles. The winners of the Team of the Year Award, Lifetime Achievement Award, Special Award, and Para Athlete Honor will be awarded Rs100,000 each.The prize money has been doubled this year, according to NSJF General Secretary Prajwal Oli.Athletes Dipak Adhikari (male), Rajpura Pachhai (female), Dev Kumar Khanal (youth), and Athletics’ Chandra Bahadur Gurung (coach) and Sikka Suwal Shrestha (table tennis) were the winners in the respective category last year. Also, photojournalist Sudarshan Ranjit bagged the special award, Maiya Bisunkhe earned the para-athlete honour, Olympian and former weightlifter Rajendra Kumar Pradhan received Lifetime Achievement award and Chinese sports journalist Cheu Chan Fai was feted with Asian Sports Journalist Award. \nAnother Olympic Games has come and gone and Nepal’s quest to bring home an official Olympic medal continues to seem like a pipe dream.Nepal sent seven athletes to the 2024 Summer Games in Paris to compete in six different sports but none of them will have anything to show for back home—no athlete from Nepal has won a single official medal in the country’s 60-year Olympic history.But, is it at all realistic to expect an Olympic medal from Nepali athletes?“Winning a medal at the Olympics is not impossible. But our investment and preparation for the Olympics and other international events are woefully inadequate,” said former Olympican Deepak Bista, who currently serves as the president of Nepal Olympians Association and the director of national team preparation, at the National Sports Council. “There are no proper venues for players to train and practice, So how do you compete against elite athletes from around the world?” Athlete Santoshi Shrestha completed the difficult 41.195km track of the women’s marathon event in the 79th position out of 91 athletes. Her timing of 2 hours 55 minutes and 06 seconds was far from her previous best and national record of 2 hours 46 minutes and 23 seconds, which she set on the way to marathon debut gold at Bangabandhu Sheikh Mujib Dhaka Marathon earlier this year.After the women’s marathon, Santoshi said she could have set a new national record in Paris had she pushed herself more in an endurance-testing track, but she chose not to because of fear of possible injury.“I could not take the risk because the track was very steep after 15 km. I was comfortable and could have made a new record there [in Paris] but I chose to stay in the comfort zone. I want to compete in other tournaments as well,” said Santoshi.But Santoshi’s story could have been different had her preparations and training back home been better. “Further, players, coaches and team management all need to work hard with complete focus and dedication all round the year if they are to bring medals. Sadly, the state of our players is not good enough. They are compelled to find other jobs so that they can look after their families. How can we expect them to win medals at big tournaments?” added Bista, who was the second Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, Beijing 2008.“The players need physical, mental and financial support.”Former Nepali Olympian Sangina Baidya also points to poor investment and preparation in sports for Nepal’s underperformance at the Olympics.“There is a lack of extensive investment in sports infrastructures. The state should be interested in the development of sports. If there is sufficient investment at the youth level, and they get substantial funding, resources and infractures, they can undoubtedly perform better in the international competitions including the Olympics,” said taekwondo practitioner Baidya, who was the first Nepali athlete to qualify for the Olympics, in Athens 2004, through a selection tournament.“In comparison to other successful countries, here in Nepal, preparations for the Olympics start late. They get only a few months of training, which is not enough,” she added.Judoka Manita Shrestha Pradhan has a similar story. She got a training room only two months before the Olympics and she was still expected to win at least one or two bouts in Paris—which is a lot to ask for. Shrestha Pradhan could not progress beyond the first round of women’s 57 kg weight category event.There is no targeted budget for the Olympics programme despite the sports sector getting Rs3.5 billion for the fiscal year 2024/25. Only Rs9 million was allocated for the transport, lodging and food of athletes and officials participating in the Paris Olympics and Paralympics.The Nepal Olympic Committee provides $750 per person to the 10 athletes of the 10 sports under the International Olympic Committee’s Solidarity scholarship, which is insufficient. Swimmers Alexander Shah and Duana Lama trained abroad, in the United States and Thailand, respectively, but the scholarship amount was not enough for them to train at top-class facilities. Lama finished last in her Heat and 30th overall in women’s 200m freestyle.Shah, who was competing at the Olympics for a second consecutive time, will at least return home with some joy. His 51.91 seconds in the men’s 100m freestyle Heat shattered his own previous national record of 52.17 seconds set during the World Aquatic Championship in Doha, Qatar.Badminton star Prince Dahal trained in Sri Lanka and had to travel to Paris 2024 without a coach as Nepali authorities did not send the name of the coach for accreditation and visa process on time.Prince Dahal could not win a single match in the men’s singles group stage. Shooter Sushmita Nepal finished 42nd in the women’s 10m air rifle qualification event. Table tennis player Santoo Shrestha also exited the Olympics from the men’s singles preliminary round.But big investment in sports may not always do the trick.Santoo Shrestha, who competed in the men’s singles table tennis at Paris Olympics, was the only third player in Nepal’s Olympic history to qualify for the Olympics through the selection stage—which is a perfect demonstration of how poor the country is technically.Take Jamaica and Kenya. Athletes in these countries are highly successful in athletics.Jamaica—the home of sprinter Usian Bolt, eight time Olympic gold medallist and world record holder in the 100 metres, 200 metres, and 4 × 100 metres relay—has won a total of 87 medals at the Olympics. Of them 86 have come from track and field.Kenya is the most successful African country at the Olympics, with a total of 124 medals so far. Of them 117 are from track and field and seven from boxing.Ethiopia is another nation which focuses on long-distance events. Their total of 58 Olympic medals have all come in long-distance events in athletics.India was once a dominant country in field hockey and won a record 11 Olympic medals, including eight golds between 1928 and 1980. Although the country experienced a drought in hockey medals, the sport is gradually finding new success after its team picked two consecutive hockey bronze medals in Tokyo 2020 and Paris 2024. Wrestling and shooting are the other sports Indian athletes specialise in.“The government should learn from how other countries prepare their athletes,” said Bista, suggesting that Nepal should target some sports for the 2028 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and prepare accordingly.Nepal has won a total of 26 medals at the Asian Games. Of them, it has bagged 24 medals in martial arts, which include karate (4), taekwondo (14) and boxing (6). “Nepal should select sports in which Nepal is historically good, for instance martial arts. After that, the government should allocate a significant budget just for the Olympics programme and train the players from the beginning if it expects our athletes to do better,” Bista added.Technically, Nepal’s only medal at the Olympics came in 1988 in Seoul when Bidhan Lama won a bronze medal in the men’s 50kg weight category taekwondo competition. But his medal was counted as unofficial as the sport was then an exhibition event. Taekwondo entered the Olympics programme only at Sydney 2000.But the 2026 Asian Games in Aichi-Nagoya, Japan could be a head start.The National Sports Council has launched Mission 2026 as part of the preparations for the next Asiad and has targeted at least 10 medals. But, sadly, the government has only approved Rs20 million for the programme.“We don’t have enough funding for the programme. This amount will support our athletes for only five to six months. It is unfortunate that the government could not embrace the NSC’s mission.” Bista said, adding that he fears Mission 2026 will just be an ambitious dream.But Bista hopes Palesha Goverdhan may change history despite the odds. Goverdhan became the first Nepali paralympian to pass the selection stage when she qualified for the Paris Paralympics. She won a gold medal in the Asian Qualifiers in China.Govardhan also won a bronze at the 2022 Asian Para Games, becoming the first Nepali para athlete to win a medal at the event.“Palesha is training in London under one of the best trainers,” said Bista who added that the NSC is paying her training fees. \nMartyrs Memorial A-Division League champions Church Boys United failed to progress to the group stage of the AFC Challenge League after they lost to Bhutan’s Paro FC 2-1 in the qualification playoff at the Dasharath Stadium in Kathmandu on Tuesday.The country’s only international-standard stadium was hosting an international match only days after the Asian Football Confederation deemed it fit for tournaments. Nepal’s national team were forced to move their home matches of the 2026 FIFA World Cup and 2027 AFC Asian Cup Qualifications second round to away and neutral venues in March after AFC called the stadium substandard.The build up to Tuesday's playoff clash was also marred by Japanese football icon Keisuke Honda’s comments “this is like a joke?” when he and his team witnessed ground staff mowing the grass on the Bhadrakali football ground, where they were supposed to practice.The 38-year-old Honda played for Japan’s national team at the 2010, 2014 and 2018 World Cups. He also played for Serie A team AC Milan during the 2014-2017 seasons.But the poor management of the stadium was clearly exposed to the outside world when the day’s rainfall turned the stadium into a muddy and slippery pitch, where players of both sides struggled to get the ball rolling.Honda and almost all the players in the ground were covered in mud only minutes into the first half.Despite the poorly maintained ground, Paro came from behind to outsmart Church Boys, thanks to Kinga Wangchu’s first-half equaliser and William Opoku Asiedu’s winner after the break.It was Paro’s first ever victory in the continental competition in three attempts (in 2020, 2022, 2023/24). They were defeated by Machhindra Club in the preliminary round of the AFC Cup in Kathmandu last year. Church Boys were also competing in the AFC’s tournament for the first time after winning the A-Division League title in their debut season in 2023.Coach Bal Gopal Maharjan started seven national team regulars against the Bhutanese side, who had recruited 11 foreign players for Tuesday’s battle. Honda, who joined Paro on a one match contract, was playing his first competitive match since 2021 and made his presence felt after the hour-mark when his deftly taken low freekick pierced the Church Boys defence and rattled the upright.But, roared by a jam-packed stadium, Church Boys took the lead in the 39th minute when Moses Gyabaah Twum perfectly laid a cross from Arik Bista for Laken Limbu to tap home.The celebrations of the hosts were short-lived as Wangchu, who was surprisingly left unmarked, took advantage of poor goalkeeping from Deep Karki and slotted the ball into the empty net.Church Boys looked more aggressive after the restart and kept flirting with Paro goalkeeper Milos Cupic, with Anjan Bista testing the netkeeper in the 47th minute and Sanish Shrestha’s lofted shot from outside the box almost beating him ten minutes later.But Paro silenced the crowd when Ghanian Opoku, who has also featured for Nepal Super League club Birgunj United and A-Division club Satdobato Youth Club, pounced on a dreadful defending from Omolaja Kareem and completed a remarkable comeback by slamming the bottom corner.Church Boys desperately searched for an equaliser in the final moments and Twum was able to break into a tight Paro defence but could not revive the hopes of Church Boys to reach the main event of the third-tier Asian competition in their debut season. \nThe Nepali national cricket team has commenced a two-week training programme at the National Cricket Academy (NCA) in Bengaluru, India. The Academy is owned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI).The Cricket Association of Nepal (CAN) expressed its appreciation to Jay Shah, secretary of the BCCI, in a Facebook post for his support of the initiative.

The Freedom House Report 2024 concluded that democracy is under attack in every region of the world. The IDEA report reaffirmed it. These problems are perhaps more pronounced in South Asian democracies than elsewhere. South Asia is a basket case of nascent, fledgling and trembling democracies which have suffered repeated and nearly fatal setbacks before they could be firmly institutionalised. Political upheaval in Bangladesh is the latest case in point. Last week, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was forced to resign and flee the country just after seven months of claiming unrivalled electoral victory for a fourth consecutive term in office.The downturnDemocratic deficit is pervasive in all of South Asia. Afghanistan has been under ultraconservative Taliban rule since 2021. Bangladesh, in its five-decade existence, has gone under several military coups and dictatorships and is now culminating in the collapse of Hasina's elected autocracy. After mass protests in April 2022, Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa was also forced to leave the country; he eventually resigned while in exile, ending the nefarious 'rule of the Rajapaksa clan'. The flipflop in Pakistani democracy is seemingly a never-ending saga. Either a direct military rule or a dense shadow of the army over any so-called civilian government in history has been the signature governing feature of the Islamic Republic.The democracy scorecard of regional superpower India, often referred to as the world's largest democracy, is also not progressive. In an overall score of freedom, India declined by 10 points (scoring only 66 out of 100) during the last decade (2013-23), while Bangladesh was even worse with the loss of 13 points and got only 40 out of 100. The alleged religious intolerance in India and rigged and violent elections in Bangladesh are cited as the reasons for such decline. Although Nepal added four points to be at 62 in this particular measure, mainly due to the smooth transition of power after the last parliamentary elections in 2022, the dominance of communist ideology in Nepal's politics, in some way or another, has been a key bottleneck in consolidating and institutionalising the newly adopted federal democracy. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party won 63 lesser seats in recent elections (or 240 only) compared to the 2019 elections. It fell short of securing majority seats in the 543-member lower house, the Lok Sabha. The ailmentsThe trigger for protests to overthrow regimes may vary according to the country’s context. For example, the Sri Lankan protests resulted from increasing economic hardships, as the state coffers emptied and the government introduced extreme rationing of essential commodities. On the contrary, Bangladesh was lauded as a miracle in economic growth, with quadrupled per capita income from $698 in 2009 to $2,688 in 2022. Despite this, protests erupted against the government’s decision to reserve a 30 percent quota of government jobs for the families of veterans of the freedom struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971.But again, they were only the triggers. The real reasons, generally common to all countries of the region, are long-accumulated discontent against nepotism, corruption, brutal suppression of dissenting voices, misrule, use of state mechanisms to rig elections and growing hopelessness among the youths, among several other factors.At the core of every malaise is the lack of democratic intent in major political players in these countries. Instead of empowering and ensuring the impartiality of key democratic institutions like the judiciary, election commission, bureaucracy and security apparatus, there is a growing tendency to make them subservient to serve the interests of the ruling elites. Atrocities to silence opposition voices and revenge politics when in power are common in the politics of the entire subcontinent. In the majority of these countries, only a handful of 'elite' families have monopolised their countries' politics for long. Regime stability is often misinterpreted as democratic stability. Therefore, the quest for institutionalising democracy in South Asian nations has proven to be a mirage by design, not by default. The geopoliticsIn each of South Asian nations except India, the leadership across the political spectrum is convinced that it can rise to or retain power only if it can secure support from a regional superpower. Traditionally, these political forces, barring the Pakistanis, competed to get the favour of the Indian establishment. But now, with the rise of China as the next-door economic powerhouse and its manifested interest in expanding the sphere of influence in South Asia, both India and China are competing to cultivate and nurture their 'pet' leaders in each of these countries. In the process, they overlook falling mercury in the popularity barometer of the leaders they favoured. These superpowers put forth their rather elusive 'security concern' argument to rationalise their engagement.The current Bangladesh imbroglio is the latest example. Sheikh Hasina got unconditional support from New Delhi despite her anti-democratic excesses. Modi government did not even warn not to compromise fundamental democratic values while dealing with the opposition. Indian diplomacy seemed too preoccupied with the alleged collusion of Hasina's detractors with the forces not friendly to India. India follows a similar pattern of diplomacy in other neighbouring countries as well. This has unleashed a trend of vertical split between the political forces trying to win either Indian or Chinese favour, also in Nepal, Sri Lanka and the Maldives. Pakistan is already in the Chinese lap. In this race to increase strategic influence, democracy ceases to be a defining variable.Instead of banking on a single personality like Hasina, India, as a regional superpower and the largest democracy, ideally should have contributed to institutionalising democracy in the neighbourhood by charting out a subcontinental democratic axis. This could serve a double purpose: To protect its traditional sphere of influence and stabilise democracy in the entire neighbourhood. But, at present, Lutyens' Delhi seems more preoccupied with the preset narrative of security concern than internalising the benign effects of promoting genuine democracy in neighbouring countries as its topmost agenda of 'neighbourhood first' policy. \nIt’s not a good sign for people to start questioning a government’s anti-corruption credentials barely a month after its formation. Yet they have choice but to do so with the government seemingly intent on giving a free pass to many corrupt officials and leaders. As per a bill currently under discussion in the State Affairs and Good Governance Committee of Parliament, a corruption case should be filed within five years of the knowledge of such an instance of corruption. (It is unclear who should have such knowledge.) Similarly, if an individual had been involved in corruption while being in a public position and could not be punished at the time, they too should be punished within five years of retirement. In fact, the bill was first registered by the then KP Sharma Oli government on January 20, 2020. It was passed and sent to Parliament on April 10, 2023. With Oli back in power, the bill, which is supposed to amend the Prevention of Corruption Act, 2059 (2002 AD) has now again come to the centrestage. The bill presented by the Oli government seems to have been inspired by a “forgive and forget” approach to corruption. It is so indefensible that even the MPs from the ruling parties are struggling to do it. Lawmakers of the opposition Maoist Centre and Rastriya Swatantra Party have also rightly pointed out that the deadline of five years is regressive. As it stands, the UML is the sole party in defense of the bill. If the other parties, both ruling and opposition, stick to their guns, the government will have to back down, and it should. For there is absolutely no rhyme or reason for the five-year cap; and were such a cap to be imposed, countless current and former politicians and bureaucrats who are soaked in corruption would walk scot-free. Nepal already ranks an alarming 108 of the 180 countries on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index (CPI) 2023—below fellow South Asian countries Bhutan (26th), the Maldives (93rd) and India (93rd). Moreover, the conviction rate in corruption cases in 2021-22 stood at just 38.5 percent. If there is one thing the government should do at this time, it is to bring policies to reduce corruption and punish the corrupt with due diligence. However, it seems to want to take the opposite route.From instances of money laundering to land grabbing, selling diplomatic passports to turning citizens into refugees, corruption is widespread in Nepal. No political party is free from corruption, which is also exemplified by recent investigations into high-level politicians in the Lalita Niwas land grab scam, the gold smuggling scams, and the Bhutanese refugee scam. There is ample evidence of how no corrupt country can steadily move forward on the path of peace and prosperity. This is why, fighting corruption should be the top agenda of all big and small political parties that purport to work in national interest. Those who don’t do so deserve to be singled out and punished for doing irreparable harm to their country.  \nThe luxurious new life of Pushpa Kamal Dahal is an antithesis of his younger days when he took up arms for the sake of the marginalised and downtrodden sections of society. As the leader of a bloody insurgency that claimed nearly 17,000 lives, Dahal has always had a legion of detractors. But when he first came out of the jungles to join mainstream politics, he also had a lot of public support, as was evident from the 220 seats his party won in the first Constituent Assembly election in 2008. The Maoist tally was double the number of the second-placed Nepali Congress, as the party got nearly 30 percent of all cast votes. By the time of the 2022 national elections, it had to be satisfied with 32 seats and just around 14 percent of the votes. The reason for this steady erosion in the party’s electoral support is clear enough. Primarily, it is a reflection of Dahal forgetting his roots. He is today no different to the ‘crony capitalists’ of the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML he once blamed for all the country’s woes. There is now not a ‘progressive’ bone in his body. Yet following his ignominious exit as prime minister a month ago, Dahal has been in a hurry to put together a progressive alliance of socialist and left-learning forces. He is already in the four-party Socialist Front which, besides the Maoist Centre, also has as its members the CPN (Unified Socialist), the Nepal Socialist Party and the Communist Party of Nepal. The Maoist chief wants to further expand the collaboration between such like-minded forces. Moreover, his Maoist Centre party has announced a new nationwide campaign whereby it will go to people’s doorsteps to explain the party’s agendas and to get feedback. The feedback is likely to be angry. The party has long since abandoned its principled advocacy on behalf of women, Dalits, Janjatis and other marginalised communities—the groups that were its core voters. As things stand, on the right of the political centre in Nepal there is the Congress while the UML occupies the left of the centre. The people disenchanted with both these outfits are plumping for new forces like the Rastriya Swatantra Party and the Janamat Party. Where in this political spectrum does today’s toothless Maoist party fit, one wonders. People won’t also be fooled by the formation of so-called leftist and socialist fronts. Dahal seems to remember his once core constituencies only when he is out of power. Disenchantment against him is growing, even within the Maoist Centre. After a long while, other party leaders are openly criticising his undisguised lust for power, most evident in his oscillation between the Congress and the UML just so he could occupy the prime minister’s chair. Some, like Narayan Kaji Shrestha and Janardan Sharma, have asked him to make way for a new leader. If Dahal is serious about reviving his party’s fortunes and leaving behind a credible legacy, he should be the one to make the biggest sacrifice. The options before him are limited. Gone are the days his gift of the gab alone could change people’s hearts and minds.  \nAt the recent CAVA Women’s Volleyball Nations League, the Nepali women’s team captured national attention when they beat the mighty Indian team, by three sets to two. After a tumultuous subsequent journey, including the bitter first loss to Iran 2-3, a victory over the Maldives 3-0, and another win over Iran in straight sets, Nepal reached the finals to face India again. Our women fought valiantly, but unfortunately, they couldn’t win the trophy. Their performance, nonetheless, has certainly raised the visibility of women’s sports in Nepal. Over the years, more and more Nepali women have ventured into the world of sports, be it football, cricket, or volleyball. And they are not just participating; they are excelling. The Nepali women’s football team is a case in point. In the FIFA World rankings, they stand in the 101st position, which is way higher than the Nepali men team’s ranking of 175. But then, patriarchal mindsets still drag them down. In Nepal’s case, exceptions aside, women’s athletes and players barely get noticed unless they do exceptionally well. Apparently, many people aren’t as fond of women’s sports as they are of men’s. This stems from the belief that women are unsporty and less competitive compared to men. This is where the problem lies, as it not only discourages young girls and women but also impedes policymakers from introducing women-friendly sports policies. Moreover, many of our policies and provisions are far from conducive to upskilling them. Nepal, for instance, has no women’s football league. Nor do we have a professional setup, as the women’s national football team relies on teams from security forces, including Nepal Police, Armed Police Force and Nepal Army. This does not make sense. Sports analysts see greater prospects of Nepali women qualifying for top international events like women’s cricket and football world cups compared to men—but only if they get a level playing field, proper training and enough top-notch match practice. There is also great disparity in terms of pay. Earlier this year, the Cricket Association of Nepal announced the players’ salary contracts, in which a significant payscale difference is evident: While the Grade A male cricketer will receive Rs100,000 a month, a female cricketer of the same grade will get only Rs50,000. Such a glaring gap will greatly discourage our girls from taking up sports of any kind. When it comes to unequal pay in sports, many jump to the conclusion that men participate in more tournaments and spend more of their time playing, so they deserve to earn more. However, they don’t consider if women are being given the same kind of opportunities in terms of resources and high-level match practice. Nepali women deserve every facility and perk that is being extended to their male counterparts. There have been some encouraging developments too. For instance, the initiative of the All Nepal Football Association to pay men and women footballers equally starting 2020 is laudable, as this will encourage more young girls to take up football. As Nepali women have soared to new heights in sports in the past few years, even with the limited resources at their disposal, it is the state’s responsibility to invest in them. On current evidence, they will then bring a lot of sporting glory to their homeland.  \nThe CPN (Maoist Centre) has either led or been a part of the government for most of the past decade and half. But the most recent Maoist Centre-led government under Pushpa Kamal Dahal was ousted only last month. Following this, the party’s senior leaders are in marathon meetings. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Giriraj Mani Pokharel, the Maoist Centre deputy general secretary, on the party’s review of the turn of events and its future strategy. The Maoist Centre is now out of the government. How does the party intend to go forward? We have started a series of party meetings to review the overall situation and to set the party’s agenda. We held a meeting of the office bearers that ran for five days. Now the party’s standing committee meeting is underway. After this, there will be a central committee meeting. That will take the final decisions on the party’s strategy and programmes for the coming days. In the meetings, the party chair has asked the leaders to discuss national as well as party issues frankly and honestly. At the end of the meeting, we will make an objective analysis of the overall situation and prepare an action plan.The Central Committee endorses the decisions. But the meetings of the office bearers and standing committee set the agenda and orientation for the party. What have you decided so far? On the national front, obviously, the dissolution of our government and formation of a new alliance is an issue. Leaders of the new coalition have said their alliance is for making changes in the constitution. They however are still not transparent. Based on their statements, it can be said that they are going against their own pledges. During the election campaign, they had said nothing about changing the constitution. You don’t find it in their manifestos as well. But in the middle of this five-year tenure, they have come up with a new agenda. A question arises: Can they change the constitution? Doesn’t that violate the mandate the parties got through the elections? Generally, the constitution might be reviewed after 10 years of its implementation. But we haven’t implemented it in a full-fledged way as we don’t even have all the laws required for its effective implementation. We have just agreed to conclude the remaining tasks of the peace process. So, the proposal to amend the constitution without first completing the basics required for its implementation is wrong. They want to make changes in the proportional inclusive system of our constitution. A political force can work to secure a majority in the House through general elections and ensure stability in the country. We accept that. We have also been lobbying for a directly elected executive president for political stability. They are not ready to debate on that. But they want to revoke the inclusive system, a major achievement of the 2006 people’s movement. This system has empowered historically excluded and deprived communities. We have to enhance the capacity of these groups instead of depriving them of their rights. If there are anomalies in the system’s implementation, let’s develop methods to more effectively pick our representatives. But the ruling parties seem intent on turning back the clock. Some leaders have publicly announced that they want to end the role of small parties. There can be a number of political parties in a country like Nepal, which is rich in social diversity. We adopted federalism for the same purpose. The leaders give priority to their family members and loyal ones while selecting election candidates and blame the constitution for the ensuing mistakes. They want to rule the country indefinitely through a two-party system. So we think the Congress-UML alliance is on the path of regression. Republicanism, federalism, secularism, inclusion and socialism-oriented systems are integrated five pillars of the present constitution. No attack on them will be tolerated. This is one focus of our ongoing meeting. We are also discussing some fresh international issues such as the developments in Bangladesh. We have yet to get a complete picture from there. But we can still learn some things. The centre of global affairs is changing and shifting to Asia. More importantly, there is a strong influence of such geopolitical forces in Nepal as well.Party chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal has said that there was an external hand in the recent change of coalition.External elements are active, in one way or the other. Some want to make our country a playground of external forces but our party and party chair firmly stood against it. The forces that wanted various things but didn’t get them from the government then started searching for a character suitable for them. People aren’t aware of such unseen elements but we should be careful. In the meeting, we are discussing this issue as well.Do you think geopolitics is the major reason for the ouster of the Dahal-led government?In his third term as a prime minister, Prachanda was working with certain priorities such as good governance, social justice and prosperity. He had taken governance seriously. Previously, there was a practice of exploiting state coffers in collusion between politicians, big businessmen and bureaucrats. The Prachanda-led government strongly stood against such a nexus. Actions against those involved in Bhutanese refugee scam, Lalita Niwas land grab, Bansbari Leather Shoe land scam, and gold smuggling are some examples. The government formulated a law to address the problems of loan shark victims. But some individuals associated with the coalition partners were involved in the scams. Were these bad elements linked to the Congress or the UML? Dahal entered into coalitions with both.The individuals were linked to partners in both the coalitions. The party chair made good governance his main priority but the Maoist Centre is the third-largest party so his hands were tied. When certain individuals were brought under investigation in corruption cases, the initiatives to change the government were expedited overnight. We can conclude that Prachanda government’s anti-corruption moves inspired other parties to oust it.You mentioned external interference as well as other parties’ fear of the government’s anti-corruption actions. Which one was the major reason for government change?The government’s anti-corruption drive is the main reason behind the formation of the new coalition. This drive brought the two largest parties together to form a government, which is unusual in the parliamentary system. The government is working to increase the threshold to secure seats under the proportional representation category. The proposed provision is against small parties, and the Maoist Centre has opposed this. Do you see the possibility of polarisation among the parties on this issue?When the ruling parties introduce new proposals that were not even discussed during the elections, we will definitely oppose them. We led the previous movements for people’s rights and we have to secure these rights. Thus the polarisation between those who want to trample on the statute and those who are against such attacks is inevitable. Is the Maoist Centre preparing to unify with other parties including the Nepal Communist Party led by Netra Bikram Chand Biplab?First, we are in the final stage of merging with the outfit of Mahindra Raya Yadav. Also, the Biplab-led party has endorsed the party unity proposal. We have to iron out some theoretical issues and make the party line clear in the changed national as well as international context. Dialogue between us is headed in the right direction.You earlier said party chair has urged other leaders to openly debate issues. Have they discussed why the Maoist party has lost its strength as well as the issue of the party chair holding leadership continuously for three and a half decades.Comrade Prachanda led the decade-long people’s war and subsequent political movements as well as the peace process, all of which made epochal changes in Nepal’s political history. No one can deny this. Therefore, Prachanda doesn’t need any position in the party. He is now a nationally as well as internationally established personality. But our party as well as the country needs him. Therefore, the discussions in the party are now aimed at making the best use of his personality in the larger interest of the society. As far as the reasons behind the setbacks we faced in the recent time are concerned, we had rightly assessed the situation in the past.But we couldn’t adapt to the changed context. We failed to develop our culture and lifestyle in line with our guiding ideology. Similarly, we failed to run the party in a proper way. We gave up our agendas and became power-centric. We developed anti-proletariat tendencies. We were gradually distanced from the public. Now we have decided that we must reestablish our relations with the working class and the oppressed. We have also failed to communicate about the important works we did when we were in the government. We need to tell the people what we did in their favour when we were in government in the past 15 years. There will also be some serious soul-searching.There is a perception that the Maoist Centre and its leaders are incapable of staying out of power.Our party’s general convention had decided to maintain a right balance in the party’s role in the government, Parliament and the street. It is true that we were in the past more engaged in the government. The party chair has already said that our focus won’t be the government from now on. \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe weather across the country on Wednesday is expected to be generally cloudy.
