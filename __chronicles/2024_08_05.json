Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nDespite a parliamentary resolution mandating an end to Dalit discrimination and proportional representation in state agencies, successive Nepali governments have failed to include Dalits in the Cabinet or ensure their adequate representation in other state structures, sparking protests from Dalit lawmakers.\nPrime Minister Oli, the CPN-UML's chairman, warns against factionalism within the party, while some leaders accuse him of promoting it despite a lack of open challenges to his authority.\nResearch and initiatives aim to address the challenges of water resource management and ecosystem conservation in Nepal's rivers, particularly in urban areas, highlighting the importance of respecting natural river systems, integrating knowledge systems, and addressing the impacts of urbanization and encroachment to protect rivers and their vital role for human and environmental well-being.\nNepal's women's volleyball team lost 2-3 to Iran in the 2024 CAVA Nations League, despite having already qualified for the semi-finals.\nDue to political turmoil in Bangladesh, Nepal's border with India has heightened security to prevent illegal infiltration of third-country citizens, particularly after Bangladeshi PM's resignation amid ongoing unrest.\nThe Nepali embassy in Dhaka halts operations amid Bangladesh's unrest after Prime Minister Hasina's resignation.\nBoth tunnels at Dhedre, Makawanpur, along the under-construction Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway have achieved breakthroughs.A 1.728-km-long tunnel (Kathmandu-Nijgadh) achieved a breakthrough on Monday. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli pressed a switch to detonate explosives for a breakthrough. A 1.653-km-long tunnel (Nijgadh-Kathmandu) breakthrough on the expressway was achieved on May 24.It is the fourth tunnel breakthrough in the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway which connects the capital city with Nijgadh in southern Nepal with a 76-km highway.Both tunnels at Lendanda have also achieved breakthroughs. A 1,612-metre tunnel, one of the twin-tube tunnels in Lendanda, located in Bakaiya and Gadhi rural municipalities of Makawanpur, made a breakthrough on July 4. Earlier, on May 24, a 1.653-km-long tunnel breakthrough was achieved.Twin tunnels, the longest in the project, are being constructed at Mahadevtar. Of the 3.3 km of tunnel (Kathmandu-Nijgadh), 2.28 km have been cleared. Similarly, of the 3.32 km of tunnel (Nijgadh-Kathmandu), 2.09 km have been cleared so far.The Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, or fast track, connects the capital city and Nijgadh in southern Nepal. Once completed, it will cut the current travel time by several hours. With 11 km in bridges and six km in tunnels, the expressway is more complex than any road construction project Nepal has undertaken before.The Nepal government formally handed over the project, under the Department of Roads, to the Nepal Army on May 4, 2017. The national force started building the multi-billion-rupee project in August of the same year, with a four-year completion target.So far, the expressway has made overall progress of 35.38 percent. \nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.Jubilant, cheering crowds stormed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence unopposed, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.Elsewhere in Dhaka, protesters climbed atop a statue of Hasina's father, state founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe.The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup.Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address to the nation and said an interim government would be formed. He called for peace and promised justice for those killed in weeks of unrest.He said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.India's ANI news agency said Hasina, 76, landed at a military airfield near Delhi. Reuters could not immediately verify this, but commercial tracking services showed a Bangladesh Air Force plane leaving the country and flying west before it disappeared.“The country is going through a revolutionary period,” said Zaman, 58, who had taken over as army chief only on June 23.“I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,” he said. “I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,” Zaman added. “Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.”Bangladesh has been engulfed by violence since student protests last month against the quotas, which reserve some public sector jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, seen as favouring allies of the ruling party.The protests escalated into a campaign demanding the overthrow of Hasina, and were met by a violent crackdown in which about 250 people have been killed and thousands injured.She had won a fourth straight term only in January this year in an election boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of her nemesis Begum Khaleda Zia.Hasina had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. The two women each inherited political movements from slain rulers - in Hasina's case, from her father Mujib; in Zia's case, from her husband Ziaur Rahman, who took power after Mujib's death and was himself assassinated in 1981.“Hasina’s resignation proves the power of the people,” said Tarique Rahman, the exiled eldest son of the two Zias who now serves as acting chairman of the opposition party.“Together, let’s rebuild Bangladesh into a democratic and developed nation, where the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” he posted on X.WEEKS OF PROTESTS, VIOLENCEStudent activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign after clashes across the country on Sunday killed nearly 100 people.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not verify the report.Sunday's death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against the job quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of Hasina's Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Bangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence. Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands, have also been closed indefinitely.The role of the country's army in tackling the violence had come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Hasina had said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”. \nGeneral elections give the political parties the only real chance to test their popularity. What we have seen in the recent past is a clear preference of Nepal’s major forces for pre-poll alliances. With the country’s mixed electoral system unlikely to give any single party an absolute majority and thus a shot at forming the government on its own, what is the harm in jointly contesting elections with other parties? That, at least, is the argument of the proponents of such pre-election tie-ups. But in reality such pre-poll alliances smack of an utter lack of confidence and conviction. Nepali parties detest being in the opposition’s bench; there is no political culture of smaller parties accepting their limited mandate and waiting for the next five years for another shot at governing. So it makes sense for them to try to ensure, even before people head to the polls, to maximise their chances of being on the right side of the parliament’s aisle. What is more, such pre-poll alliances often come with the added bonus of safe seats for top leaders. But with parties professing vastly different ideologies standing on the same platform, the only message people get is that the country’s top parties are interested less in good governance and delivery than getting to power for its own sake. But lo and behold! All three of the country’s major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—have now publicly committed to single-handedly contest the 2027 general elections. That, we are afraid, is an unlikely prospect. The Maoist Centre, the latest of the Big Three to make such a declaration, could be wiped out at the next polls without other parties’ help. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, someone who has been at the party’s helm for 35 years—and by extension his Maoist Centre party—has lost all credibility with his pendulum-like political swings. The party, which once championed the causes of the marginalised and the downtrodden, is these days an ardent backer of the kind of crony capitalism it used to accuse the Congress and the UML of fostering. In the past elections, the Maoist Centre has allied with both the parties, to limited success. The benefits of such pre-poll alliances for the two biggest parties is questionable, too. It thus makes sense for these parties, including the Maoist Centre, to test their individual strength in upcoming elections. Despite the short-term risks, that would be the right thing to do, for the individual interests of these parties and for the larger good of Nepali democracy. People today are confused as they have no clear options at elections, and many of them choose not to vote. If instead the ballot papers reflect a clear choice between competing ideologies and agendas, it’s a whole new ballgame. The electorate can then make informed choices. For the political parties, the general elections offer a rare chance to test the strength of their programmes and leaders. Why lose this golden opportunity to do so and adapt accordingly for long-term success? Once individual parties know their real electoral strength, they can always join hands with other parties to form federal and provincial governments. Their public positions notwithstanding, do our political parties and their leaders have the self-belief to take the poll-plunge alone? People doubt it. But they will be happy to be proven wrong.   \nThe instant reaction to the Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 has been celebratory for the most part. How it will be judged in months and quarters to come remains to be seen. For now, the stock market has spoken. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), which had already been rallying feverishly since early July, surged by 4.4 percent on July 28—the first day of trading after the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the country’s central bank, published the policy on July 26. The NRB has drawn accolades for adopting an expansionary policy. It lowered the benchmark interest rates, scrapped the Rs200 million margin-loan cap for institutional investors and reduced provisioning requirement for banks, among others.Stocks particularly reacted to the removal of the margin-loan ceiling for institutional investors. A brief history is in order: Three years ago, the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. The NRB aimed to rein in the prevailing massive investor speculation back then. Soon after, the NEPSE tagged 3,227 in August 2021 and headed lower. The snorting bulls were up in arms and put all kinds of pressure on the Maha Prasad Adhikari-led central bank to roll back the cap, to no avail. Last October, the Rs120 million ceiling was upped to Rs150 million for individual investors and Rs200 million for institutional investors. Fast forward to now, and the cap for individual investors remains, but a limit no longer binds institutional investors. They can borrow as much as they wish. The NEPSE shot up by 35.5 percent in July to reach 2,761. Earlier, soon after it peaked in August 2021, it was rangebound between 1,800 and 2,200 before it broke out in the middle of last month. The July move looks parabolic, but volume is fully cooperating. As of mid-June, banks and financial institutions (20 commercial banks, 17 development banks and 17 finance companies) held Rs87.1 billion in margin loans, up from Rs76.5 billion as of mid-July last year. It is safe to assume that the latest monetary policy will embolden investors to take on additional leverage.Setting bad precedent Leaving aside the fact that leverage cuts both ways and contractions in leverage will hurt stocks, the current market momentum is up, and leverage can be beneficial. The NRB should closely monitor how the current bull will evolve and what kind of speculative mania this will spawn. Three years ago, the NEPSE continued to rise non-stop for over two years before it reached a record in August 2021. More important is whether the NRB leadership will have the willingness and the courage to tackle a scenario in which excessive leverage risks hurting investors and/or the economy. In this regard, Governor Adhikari withstood undue pressure from even former finance ministers who wanted looser margin-lending rules.Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the current economic adviser to Prime Minister KP Oli and former NRB governor, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission as well as finance minister, was one of several former finance ministers to openly call on the NRB to remove the margin-loan cap last year. Whether last month’s lifting of the Rs200 million cap for institutional investors was done at the sole discretion of the central bank or Khatiwada had a hand in it, we don’t know. This much we do know: The monetary policy, originally scheduled to come out on July 19, was delayed by a whole week. Apparently, on July 18, Khatiwada wanted to study the policy and borrowed it, causing the dillydally. This sets a bad precedent.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, (1) The objectives of the bank are (i) To formulate and manage monetary and foreign exchange policies in order to maintain price and balance of payment stability for the achievement of economic stability and sustainable development of the economy; (ii) To raise public confidence towards the banking and financial system by making the sectors stable and by increasing access to financial services; (iii) To develop a secure, healthy and efficient payment system. (2) The bank, without any prejudice to the objectives referred to in subsection 1, will extend cooperation in the implementation of economic policies of the government of Nepal.Restore central bank credibilityThe Act also states that the bank shall be an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. Sub-section 2 nonetheless creates room for government intervention, particularly considering that the bank’s seven-member board of directors comprises the governor, two deputy governors, secretary at the Ministry of Finance and three others appointed by the government. If the newly appointed prime minister wanted to review the monetary policy, he should have done so via Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel. The Act states that any contact between the bank and the government should be made through the Ministry of Finance. It was wrong for Khatiwada to interject himself into this.Internal politics within the Oli-led NPC-UML may have played a role. Bishnu Poudel is the party's vice-chairman, while Shanker Pokharel is the general secretary. The two locked horns in July, trying to instil their loyal for the position of chief minister of Lumbini Province. In the end, with Oli’s blessing, Pokharel’s candidate won. It is logical to assume that Poudel and Khatiwada have different priorities for handling the stock market/economy. This, however, cannot justify Khatiwada’s intervention. The optics are jarring. Good governance, the rule of law and the end of corruption are some catchphrases thrown around in the Oli-led coalition government. Khatiwada’s faux pas is anything but good governance.Central banks live or die by credibility. The NRB’s primary responsibility is to carry out monetary policy. Fiscal policy falls under the purview of the government. By nature, politicians are driven by the next election cycle and would like good things—such as rising stock prices—to unfold during their time in power. In contrast, the NRB, as a regulator, cannot and should not wish for higher or lower prices; rather, it should focus on creating a durable investing environment. Bringing out a monetary policy a week later than the scheduled time does not help boost the confidence of foreign investors, largely because this was due to government intervention. Let the “independent” NRB stay independent. \nThe Annual Kathmandu Conference on Nepal and the Himalaya, organised by Social Science Baha, a research organisation in association with some institutions from Nepal and abroad, from July 24-26 in Kathmandu, was a huge success. My participation was minuscule in the event. I attended a few sessions and listened to some papers out of the 56 presented this year.Prof Nirmal Man Tuladhar, chair of Social Science Baha, naturally sounded proud while telling us about the growing popularity of the conference each year. I have not accessed a comprehensive analysis of the nature, size and features of the Baha conferences held in the metropolis. What I know is that they are well-attended and used by a wide cohort of researchers, scholars, dreamers and some freaks. That is, of course, the nature of conferences of such size anywhere in the world. The Baha conference is a focussed affair where senior scholars and PhD researchers converge. I was told some of them have already booked their conference seats for next year. Such is its popularity. They take up diverse themes like Nepal, the Himalayas, earth and ecology, nature, ideas, fieldwork methods, changing societies, mental problems, the agonies of Mother Earth, altitudes and human behaviours. This paints a picture of diversity. Serious and dedicated discussants and audiences give conferences a special character. There is no time for little breaks either in the day or night for a few rounds of poetry readings and music performances. No painter rushes with brush and palette. It would be a diversion. Deepak Thapa’s successful leadership is one reason for Social Science Baha’s continuity and freshness. I do not have other information about people and institutions to present here. As it is linked to the Himal association, it has always benefited from Kanak Dixit’s leadership, research and contacts, among others. Martin Cahutari is another research institute and public forum that is open year-round. People use the Chautari for meetings, presentations and interactions. It has an excellent library where one can access research materials and a collection of books and journals with research relevance. Historian Pratyoush Onta’s dedication and scholarship, as well as the hard work of his cohort and their research, have kept the Chautari going. The Linguistic Society of Nepal organises internationally popular annual conferences. It sometimes works in tandem with the Central Department of Linguistics, too. The Literary Association of Nepal is another organisation that holds seminars annually. As chairman of both of these associations in the past, I can write other articles about the struggle to create a forum for such organisations. It was not easy to work at a time when the political system of the country was not democratic. The broader international participation and the free expression of opinions were particularly in focus. But we continued the work. Today, I feel happy that our erstwhile students, who have become academics, run these organisations. I remember making some short presentations at Baha in the past. This year, I was invited to discuss at a session \"Of Journeys and Worldviews: Formation of Early Modern Consciousness in Nepal\". Three Central Department of English academics, Shiva Rijal, Mahesh Paudyal and Komal Phuyal, made different presentations on the above theme. The courses in the department are interdisciplinary. They chose Nepali fictional and dramatic texts that address the times when travelling on foot was a common practice.According to these scholars, the well-known Nepali literary texts that depict this condition give a picture of a feudal society where people's physical mobility coheres with the level of consciousness and characters’ aspirations. Through their analyses of the texts, they discussed a condition of power and discipline; they evoked the theories of New Historicism and the power and knowledge of the French theorist Michel Foucault. My comments were woven around these themes. Rijal gave a picture of a society where an individual’s journeys, confusions and quests get dramatised in the plays. Travelling on foot sets the stage. He addressed the tension between the wide space of travel and its representation on small impromptu stages. The staging of Mukunda Indira (1939) and Sahanshila Sushila (1940) at Durbar High School and the newly opened Judhyodaya Public School, respectively, shows that theatrical reality. The text Mukunda Indira is set along the route to India, whereas Sahanshila Sushila is set in Kathmandu and Nuwakot. Rijal's theory is that ''Reading Nepal’s walking era through modern plays is not a literary experience alone.'' It opens up more.Phuyal chose early fictional texts like Lil Bahadur Chhetri’s Basain (1957) and Lain Sing Bangdel’s Muluk Bahira (1948). He claimed these fictional works show the \"formation of the political self of the society.\" He sees through these novels the Nepali state making efforts to what he calls \"to intellectually and politically awake itself from the grip of traditional lynchpins.\" Paudyal’s choice of what he rightly calls \"seven representative Nepali short stories\" written in pre-modern Nepali times represent the long forties of the 20th century. As the engine-propelled means of transport had not become accessible, especially to the common people wanting to move, travelling became solely a bodily performance. He shows how, in the stories, this factor becomes a reality.In my observation, I put that some questions may be addressed while discussing the form of travel then. The accessibility of the rails in India for the Nepalis to travel extended the reality of what the paper writers rightly called pre-modern travel on foot. Through human contact, migration to places like Assam, Burma and other areas of British India became possible. However, the three paper presenters rightly evoked the conditionality of power and social mobility by using the mode of travel by foot. Using fictional characters, the paper writers gave their theory new power and explained the phenomenon of a consonance of life, reality and imagination. They had selected fiction and drama, which alone could capture that reality by bringing society, creativity and forward-looking dynamism into play. That dynamism is different from any anthropological or social study. A cohort of research-savvy audience, including Onta, discussed the subject introduced by the three scholars. I appreciate the modality of the existing conferences. This particular conference was different and effective. I returned with a good experience that evening.      \nThe prime minister and several ministers keep on asking: Since the quota reform has already been implemented, why are the students still demonstrating? The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed—the government itself admits to 150—and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.Today's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.The all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".) The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?What brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.Of all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?Use of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.The case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.How can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?We demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.It must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.It is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.Those who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).We urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too. Wisdom should compel the government not to brush them aside, which it will do only at its own peril.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nKamal Bahadur Shah, the newly appointed chief minister of Sudurpaschim Province, took his oath of office and secrecy before Province Head Najir Miya on Monday.After swearing-in, the chief minister appointed six ministers and three ministers of state, forming a 10-member council of ministers. The ministers and state ministers were also sworn in later on the day.Unlike before, the formation of the Council of Ministers did not face challenges as the issue of power-sharing between the coalition partners was immediately resolved. Chief Minister Shah successfully managed to allocate portfolios to the ministers and ministers of state.Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Nagarik Unmukti Party formed the present ruling coalition in Sudurpaschim.As part of power-sharing in the provincial government, Nepali Congress got three ministerial portfolios along with two ministers of state, including the chief minister whereas the CPN-UML got three ministerial portfolios and one state minister. The Nagarik Unmukti party is given one ministry in the Cabinet.From Nepali Congress, Bahadur Singh Thapa has been assigned to the finance ministry and Meghraj Khadka to the social development ministry. Prakash Bahadur Bam and Saraswati Khadka have become state ministers at the ministry of finance and the ministry of social development respectively.Likewise, Surendra Bahadur Pal became the minister for physical infrastructure, Bir Bahadur Thapa the minister for land management, agriculture, and cooperatives, and Hira Sarki the minister for internal affairs and law representing the UML in the cabinet. Nirmala Saud has been made the state minister for the ministry for physical infrastructure development.Laxman Kishor Chaudhary, representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party, has been appointed as the minister for industry, tourism, forest, and environment.This is Shah's second term as the chief minister. He had earlier headed the provincial government for 14 months from February 9, 2023, to April 4 this year. \nBangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina landed in India’s northeastern city of Agartala on Monday after fleeing Dhaka, broadcaster CNN-News18 reported. India is set to offer a safe passage to Hasina, the report said, citing intelligence sources. Army chief General Waker-Us-Zaman said in a televised address that Hasina 76, had left the country and that an interim government would be formed.Media reports said she had flown in a military helicopter with her sister.Television visuals showed thousands of people pouring into the streets of the capital Dhaka in jubilation and shouting slogans.Thousands also stormed Hasina’s official residence ‘Ganabhaban’, shouting slogans, pumping fists and showing victory signs.Television visuals showed crowds in the drawing rooms of the residence, and some people could be seen carrying away televisions, chairs and tables from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country.“She has fled the country, fled the country,” some shouted. Protesters in Dhaka also climbed atop a large statue of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe, the visuals showed.Student activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign, a day after deadly clashes across the country killed nearly 100 people.About 150 people were killed in protests last month.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas on Monday, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.Bangladesh has been engulfed by protests and violence that began last month after student groups demanded the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs.That escalated into a campaign to seek the ouster of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition. \nProtesting students in Bangladesh have called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign, a day after deadly clashes in the South Asian country killed nearly 100 people.Bangladesh has been engulfed by protests and violence that began last month after student groups demanded scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs. That escalated into a campaign to seek the ouster of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition.At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday in a wave of violence across the country of 170 million people as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters. Starting Sunday evening, a nationwide curfew has been imposed, the railways have suspended services and the country’s huge garments industry has closed.Sunday’s death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh’s recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.“The government has killed many students. The time has come for the final answer,” protest coordinator Asif Mahmud said in a statement on Facebook late on Sunday. “Everyone will come to Dhaka especially from the surrounding districts. Come to Dhaka and take a position on the streets.”The Bangladesh army urged everyone to obey the curfew rules.“The Bangladesh army will perform its promised duty in line with the Bangladesh constitution and existing laws of the country,” it said in a statement late on Sunday.“In this regard the people are requested to abide by the curfew as well as give full cooperation to this end,” it said, adding that the curfew was imposed to ensure the security of people’s lives, properties and important state establishments.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of the ruling Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Violence was reported in 39 of the country’s 64 districts.Army role in focusBangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence.Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of the top brands in the world, have also been closed indefinitely.“In view of the prevailing situation, owners have decided to close all garment factories across the country, considering the overall safety of the workers,” the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasina’s biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.For the second time during the recent protests, the government has shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed and Hasina’s resignation.Hasina has said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”.The role of the country’s army in tackling the violence has come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman has said the army will always be there for the people’s interests and for any needs of the state. He is due to brief the media on Monday. \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely across all provinces, with a chance of heavy rainfall in one or two locations in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist throughout the country. Light to moderate rain, with thunder and lightning, is anticipated in many areas of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, and in some parts of the remaining regions.Heavy rainfall is possible in a few places in Koshi, Madhesh, and Bagmati provinces, and at one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. There is also a risk of very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.On Sunday, the highest recorded temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius in Dipayal and Dhangadhi, while the lowest recorded temperature was 14.5 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.  \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nWriter and journalist Ghanshyam Khadka has released a new book, ‘Ananda Samhita.’ Known for his novel ‘Nirvana’, Khadka discusses philosophical insights on attaining a joyful life in this latest publication.Khadka's book highlights the issue of human suffering, delving into its root causes and exploring methods to end it to achieve lasting happiness.A statement by the publisher Alchemy reads, “While everyone spends their lives searching for happiness, many end up facing the opposite outcomes, leading to the belief that suffering is the reality of life.” They added, “This book discusses how anyone can achieve happiness under any circumstances if pursued with the right approach.”Each chapter of the book presents a straightforward concept of happiness and a practical method for implementing it.'Aananda Samhita' delves into the philosophical foundations of joy, examining how spirituality, psychology, and daily life intersect. Khadka explores these areas by providing readers with an understanding of joy beyond superficial happiness.The book also analyses different perspectives on happiness, explaining overcoming small and large obstacles in everyday life. \nWhen the Supreme Court’s verdict in March 2021 dissolved the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and revived the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), most of the leaders returned to their mother parties.A group of Maoist leaders, however, joined the UML. They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the party’s central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post. \nAs Nepal adopted the federal system while promulgating the constitution in 2015, the country’s governance was expected to be more effective with the centralised power being devolved to the seven provinces and local units.However, in practice, provincial leaders are too dependent on the top politicians at the centre when it comes to forming and running the sub-national governments.Though the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have pledged political stability in the country, observers are not convinced as the two parties too are for rotating the government leadership after some time both at the centre as well as in the provinces.The country’s mixed electoral system has been giving fractured results, resulting in no single party being able to form the government, not only at the centre but also in the seven provinces. The result is that the parties must form coalitions to constitute national as well as subnational governments. Every change of ruling partners at the centre has immediate implications on the provincial level. This was not envisioned while drafting the constitution, according to experts.Before the federal system, the authority was centralised. Even though the country was divided into five development regions and 75 districts, they only served as administrative hubs and centres. The new constitution gives executive as well as legislative powers to the provincial governments. Also, the local governments have all executive, legislative and judicial powers exercised by an elected council.“The country’s federal structure was designed to devolve the central government’s rights to the provinces and local units. But, in practice, the centre has grabbed hold of the provinces’ rights, in the same manner as in the old political structure,” former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who was a member in the Constituent Assembly as well, told the Post. “This was not how the federal structure was envisioned while drafting the constitution.”Blaming the electoral system for the prolonged political instability, the Congress-UML coalition has now vowed to amend the constitution and electoral laws purportedly to ensure stability. However, Adhikari questions the rationale behind such an amendment.“If the political leadership allows provinces to exercise their rights without dictating their daily functions from the centre, the federal system will still work,” he adds. “But they are afraid to give up power that they have been exercising for years to the subnational governments.”The July 1 change in the central coalition caused immediate jolts at the provinces.As per the two-party agreement, the UML formed the government at the centre with the Congress rallying KP Sharma Oli of the second largest party.The two parties also reached an agreement to lead governments in three provinces each while they supported the Janamat Party to form the provincial government in Madhesh. As per the deal, the UML will lead governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces in the first round while the Congress will take the reins in Bagmati, Gandaki and Sudurpaschim. Except in Sudurpaschim, the governments in the other five provinces have already been formed. Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province Dirgha Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which is now in the opposition coalition, resigned on Friday.This arrangement in the provinces will change again, with the handover in federal government leadership to the Nepali Congress after two years from the day Oli was appointed the prime minister. Prime Minister Oli, reading out the seven-point agreement from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21, said he will lead the federal government for two years, and hand over the mantle to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the change in leadership at the centre, coalitions in the provinces too are expected to realign. “Even so, there will not be the kind of instability we saw earlier,” says Congress Chief Whip Shyam Kumar Ghimire.With the change of power equations at the centre, the whole dynamics of provincial politics changed, he said. For instance, in under two years, the Koshi government changed five times. “Though the provincial governments’ leadership can change as per the two-party deal, the Congress or the UML will continue to lead, thus providing political stability.” There are already signs of discord in the Congress-UML alliance.Congress and UML leaders have already started disputing power sharing in Gandaki Province, where Congress is leading the government.UML provincial leaders have been warning Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Pandey of the Congress not to take long-term decisions as they expressed reservations over some of his moves. While forming the two-party coalition, the leaders said they wanted to ensure political stability, among other things. But political observers aren’t very optimistic. “The agreement between the two major parties says the leadership of the provincial governments will be rotated within an agreed timeframe. This will only lead to more instability,” Pitambar Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “The way our political parties are trying to run the federal structure, there could soon be a systemic crisis.” \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) on Friday announced the names of 344 central committee members.The party, which picked 93 central members through its general convention held in July's first week, announced the names of the remaining 251 members on Friday.A task force comprising Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal, senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal and General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal finalised the names of the central members.The party’s tenth general convention concluded on July 5 without giving the central committee a full shape. The Unified Socialist Party had announced that it would finalise the names of the remaining central members within ten days.Nepal and Bhusal retained their positions as party chair and general secretary, respectively, through the general convention after they were unanimously selected for the party’s two key positions. Former prime minister Khanal was also given continuity in his role as senior leader of the party.The party has yet to pick the remaining office bearers. As per its statute, the party will have 21 office bearers, including a chairman, a senior vice-chair, seven vice-chairs, including one woman, a general secretary, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries.Ahead of the general convention, the leaders amended the party statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.In August 2021, a group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party–CPN-UML–to form the Unified Socialist. \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nA year after rolling out the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), Nepal’s export of high-value products grew at a snail's pace in the last fiscal year.According to the statistics from the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the export of high-value goods increased by 10 percent in the review period.NTIS 2023, which supersedes NTIS 2016, was implemented from the beginning of last fiscal year. The latest trade strategy is meant to support Nepal's graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country by 2026.As per the statistics, export earnings from the goods identified by NTIS 2023 totalled Rs110.38 billion in the review period.Nepal’s total export amounted to Rs152.38 billion in the last fiscal year.The aim of NTIS 2023 is to diversify the export market for which a country-wise strategy was said to be prepared and implemented. But little has been done towards that end.“It’s true. Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,” said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity. There are problems in production, quality entrepreneurship development and global price competitiveness in the implementation of trade strategy. “We have started consultation with the private sector and stakeholders since the beginning of the current fiscal year regarding the legal, resource and other aspects of effective implementation of a trade strategy in the current fiscal year,” said the official.The ministry has got a budget of Rs34.5 million for the implementation of NTIS in the current fiscal year. Officials said that budget constraint is one of the problems in the full implementation of the trade strategy.According to the latest NTIS estimation, around Rs463 billion will be required for its implementation.The major target of NTIS 2023 is to attain Nepal’s trade-to-GDP ratio of 55 percent by 2026 from 43.81 percent in 2021. Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.“The development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the government’s capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.”Trade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the “least developed” status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.“The performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the products’ value chain. Making plans alone doesn’t work if they are not properly executed,” said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. “There are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.”A major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepal’s lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year. Shipment of pashmina also fell 5.32 percent to Rs3.02 billion.Export of rosin and resin acids declined by 10.51 percent to Rs1.47 billion. Shipment of Nepali paper declined by 10.18 percent to Rs1.02 billion.Gold and silver jewellery exports declined by 69.14 percent and 22.39 respectively to Rs58.23 million and Rs167.05 million accordingly.Nepal’s tea, coffee and spice exports shrank by 4.48 percent to Rs13.44 billion.Shipment of pasta fell by 14.38 percent to Rs1.96 billion during the review period. \nAt the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, crises appear to be hovering all around again.Politicking at the board, which operates under a public-private partnership model, has been a long-standing problem, affecting its national and international tourism promotional plans for decades.Political manoeuvring becomes rampant when the time for appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) begins every four years. And the key tourism promotional body is already headless.Apart from the politics over the chief’s appointment, the board has yet to introduce its annual budget, a serious matter for the agency promoting Nepal abroad.“The board is in severe crisis,” said a top board official. The crisis arrived after most countries launched free-visa policies to attract tourists.Nepal plans to draw 1.6 million tourists this year, but that will not be possible without promotions. Amid all this, the country’s poor air safety has further hindered tourism growth, the official said. There is now tough global competition to attract tourists.Laos is extending its visa exemption policy and increasing visa validity for tourists from certain countries.The Thai cabinet has rolled out a series of new visa promotions, including visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, extended student stays, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees. Under the new scheme, visitors can stay in Thailand for up to 60 days, compared to the earlier limit of 30 days.Indonesia plans to introduce visa-free entry for tourists from 20 nations, including India, by October this year.In December last year, Malaysia granted visa-free entry to citizens of China and India for up to 30 days.Zimbabwe is giving a leg up to its tourism industry with a new visa-free entry policy for 35 countries.However, poor planning, unstable politics, and plane crashes have marred Nepal’s tourism, the country’s economic growth engine, at a time when most economic indicators are dim.The tourism board has been headless since January 30 when the term of its former CEO Dhananjay Regmi ended.On top of that, the board is yet to present its annual budget. “We are on a budget holiday,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, spokesman for the Nepal Tourism Board. “From Sunday, there will be not a penny to spend on day-to-day activities.”As per the board’s financial bylaws, it has to bring the full budget by July 9. If the budget is not passed by then, it can manage expenses for day-to-day activities through a partial budget up to August 9. And there is a mandatory provision of passing the budget by August 19. If the budget is not passed by August 19, the tourism board may face a legal crisis. “We don’t know what will happen in that case,” said another senior board official.Officials say that given the ongoing crisis, the full budget seems impossible.Last fiscal year, the board earned Rs1.04 billion in tourism promotional fees charged to foreigners who departed from Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, the main source of its budget. However, only 30 percent of it has been spent. The board estimates that it will introduce a Rs1.25 billion budget this fiscal year.Lamichhane said they met Tourism Minister Badri Pandey on Wednesday, and the minister assured them that the budget would be passed.Officials say frequent government changes have affected the functioning of the board, creating a leadership vacuum. Power tussles have become common among the board of directors, appointed by different ministers belonging to different parties at different times. “In the board of directors, the members face four different directions. No agendas can be approved.”The 11-member Nepal Tourism Board comprises five representatives, each from the government and the private sector, and the CEO. The tourism secretary chairs the board.As per the law, even a six-member board can pass the budget. “We don’t know what’s stopping the tourism secretary, the board chair, from doing that,” said the official.The CEO appointment, too, seems uncertain. As per the process, a three-member CEO selection committee should be formed to appoint the chief.The sub-committee shortlists three candidates based on their presentations and interviews and submits their names to the board, ultimately selecting the CEO within 90 days of the committee’s formation.After Regmi’s term ended, the board of directors initiated the process of appointing a new CEO. However, the applications were invited only on April 6. Twenty individuals, including Regmi, had applied for the executive position. The sub-committee had shortlisted 16 candidates. However, this was challenged when a writ petition was filed at the Patan High Court questioning the legality of the sub-committee members.On April 29, the joint bench of High Court Judges Sudarshan Dev Bhatta and Kailash Prasad Subedi continued the short-term interim order issued on April 22, ordering the halt of the CEO selection process. The next hearing was scheduled for Sunday. However, the government has declared Sunday a public holiday, on the occasion of Bhoto Jatra. On this day, the Machhindranath chariot festival concludes with the showing of the legendary vest at Jawalakhel in Lalitpur.Kundan Sharma Mishra, an official at the tourism board, filed the writ petition, contesting the legality of the two board members Milan Devkota and Madan Kumar Acharya, who were nominated to the CEO selection subcommittee. The director general of the Department of Tourism is another subcommittee member.“As per the law, the Cabinet should appoint board members. But it was former tourism minister Prem Ale who appointed the two board members. This minister-level decision is illegal. If the appointment is illegal, the CEO they select will also be illegal,” said Mishra.Devkota and Acharya were appointed in March 2022.The CEO appointment process had run into controversy even in the past.In 2011, the board had shortlisted 12 applicants in the first week of November.However, it was four years later, in December 2015, that the CEO was appointed. In that period, more than two dozen writs were filed in courts to halt or postpone the appointment process.The tourism board, established in 1998 under the public-private partnership model, is mandated to promote Nepal in domestic and international markets.But the board soon became a political playground. \nNepal has eased the foreign exchange facility for Nepali travellers, traders, and those with dollar accounts as the central bank is awash with foreign currencies, with a historic high of reserves.As of mid-June, the 11th month of the last fiscal year, the country had Rs1.96 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The Nepal Rastra Bank’s own stock amounts to Rs1.75 trillion.The central bank said on Thursday that it amended the unified directives to allow Nepali citizens travelling abroad to carry $2,500 per trip. Earlier, Nepali citizens were allowed $2,500 twice a year.“Two years ago, we set the limitation on foreign exchange facilities in view of the country’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Now we have amended the unified guidelines and removed the frequency limit as resources have improved. It will be helpful for frequent travellers,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the central bank.However, the limit of the amount of currency available remains unchanged. The amendments are based on the central bank's recently announced monetary policy for the current fiscal year.Similarly, the central bank has doubled the foreign currencies available to Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet, China, and the SAARC countries. Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet via surface route can now get an exchange facility of $1,000 one time and $2,000 in a fiscal year. This will also apply to Nepalis travelling to the SAARC countries, excluding India, via surface route.This provision, however, will not apply to the residents of border regions who make frequent travels to Tibet.The country’s foreign currency stock has been breaking records in recent months, mainly due to a robust remittance growth and ever-increasing migrant departures to foreign lands in search of better incomes.Economists say that robust forex reserves suggest a scenario of low investments, particularly in a least developed country like Nepal.In June 2022, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves slid to a critical level that could sustain imports of goods for less than six months. Even the central bank's import controls did not improve the situation.Instead, the measures nearly suffocated Nepal’s economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.Following the Russia-Ukraine war, which choked the global supply system and caused prices to rise like never before, Nepal, too, suffered chronic current account deficits and was increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while forex reserves dwindled fast.In late April 2022, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods considered luxury or non-essential in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. The ban was lifted in December 2022.Paudel said that the foreign exchange ceiling has gone higher not only due to the improving forex reserve situation but also to prevent the hassles that travellers and traders are facing.People who travel frequently despite the limited forex convertibility were facing the problem of submitting documents required by the central bank, he said. “The amended provision will help such travellers.”The central bank has also amended the foreign exchange limitation for traders.According to the amended provision, traders who import goods through demand draft and telegraphic transfer are allowed to import goods of $100,000 at once, up from $60,000 before.Paudel said that the traders ordering goods beyond the limitations are required to submit documents to the central bank.But with the amendment, they can access needed facilities from any commercial bank.The amended provision has increased the payment limitation to import silver.Bullion traders importing silver to produce silver jewellery, artistic goods, and utensils, among other things, can get a foreign exchange facility of $300,000 per import. The other bullion traders importing silver can get a foreign exchange facility of $100,000 per import.The foreign exchange limitation for companies outsourcing services from foreign countries and invisible imports by domestic companies and their sister concerns has increased to $25,000 monthly from $15,000 monthly. \nMonsoon rains this year have brought with them a considerable amount of death and destruction. But they also bring some good news. Nepal has recorded one of the fastest paddy transplantation rates in many decades, courtesy of “above-normal rainfall”.According to the Department of Agriculture, the paddy transplantation rate reached 96 percent as of Wednesday. “Though details have yet to come, based on our inquiry, transplantation has been completed on 96 percent of the paddy fields,” said Arun Kafle, deputy director general of the department.He said Nepali farmers have been transplanting summer paddy at a rapid pace due to abundant rainfall, raising the prospect of a bumper harvest.This is believed to be the fastest transplantation rate in many decades. “Rainfall has been consistent, which is a boon for the crops, particularly paddy.”Agro experts say that due to the regular and abundant monsoon rains, the Madhesh province has surpassed Koshi province, its neighbour, in terms of paddy transplantation for the first time, which also surpassed the national average. Insufficient rainfall has long been a recurrent problem in the Madhesh province. A massive outflow of youths to foreign lands, creating a shortage of labourers to carry out agricultural activities, has added to the difficulties of local farmers.Agro experts say that transplanting dates differ from region to region.Early transplantation has some advantages. Agro economists say that early transplanted paddy mostly escapes pest attack, thereby reducing the additional cost of inputs in terms of pesticide application.Besides, it eases the next cycle of crops on the same field in a timely manner.“The most important part of early transplantation is that it increases the paddy areas,” said agro expert Rajendra Uprety, who is also the executive director at AgriGreen Nepal. “After transplantation, the next one-month period is critical for plant growth. If the rainfall is regular during the growth period, production will rise.”He said that in a few areas of eastern Nepal, a nutrition deficit has been observed due to the overuse of urea. Excessive urea use can easily damage other fertilisers and cause a nutrition deficit.“As urea is cheap, farmers use it without balancing it with other nutrients like potash and compost. This tendency has led to serious problems in many areas of Nepal.”In Nepal, the transplantation dates differ according to the availability of rainfall and geography. In the upper hills, paddy transplantation is completed by mid-June. In Tarai, the country’s food basket, it begins in early July and extends to early September, depending on water availability.The plains account for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region 4 percent.Last year, low rainfall delayed transplantation in Madhesh Province, affecting production and productivity.According to the Department of Agriculture, the process had been completed on 92.4 percent of the 1.39 million hectares of land available for paddy cultivation as of Sunday.Paddy transplantation was at 78 percent in the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.7 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture. Nearly two-thirds of the farmlands are rain-fed.During the four months from June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grains, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rain over the country. The rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.According to the department, Madhesh Province had the lowest transplantation rate, at 58.8 percent, last year. This accelerated to 92 percent this year. Madhesh, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields (383,150 hectares), has completed transplantation on 352,443 hectares as of Wednesday. “The growth in productivity in Madhesh raises the overall national production. So, if the rainfall continues and there is no fertiliser shortage, Nepal could see a bumper paddy harvest this year,” said Kafle. Paddy is harvested from mid-October to November. Sudurpaschim Province saw the highest transplantation rate, at 99.6 percent of its 174,576 hectares, followed by Karnali Province, with 96.9 percent of its 41,904 hectares, Madhesh Province, with 92 percent, and Gandaki Province’s 91.9 percent of 96,053 hectares.The rate in Lumbini province has been recorded at 91.3 percent of 311,643 hectares. In Bagmati Province, transplantation is complete on 90.8 percent of its 112,273 hectares. The Koshi province saw the lowest transplantation rate of 90.7 percent of 276,386 hectares. Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nThe polio immunisation drive launched in the Kathmandu Valley a week ago has achieved an impressive 104 percent coverage rate. This is not the first time coverage rate of a healthcare campaign has exceeded 100 percent.What concerns public health experts is that even if the coverage of the health campaign exceeds 100 percent every time, post-campaign surveys reveal actual coverage falling short.“We don’t have the exact count of the floating population or those living in the city slums,” said Dr Arjun Spkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Moreover there are refugees in the capital. Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programmes are credited with this achievement. \nAt least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera. Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense. Even during a brief encounter, you can tell she has the patience needed to be a baker.“You can eyeball cooking, but baking is chemistry. You have to be meticulous. You cannot rush it, or it does not turn out as expected,” says the 21-year-old environment science student. She also runs the online baking shop Bakeleus. Recently, she has also started selling her baked goods beyond her online shop, with her first stall appearing at The Yellow House’s Night Market. Bakeleus’s menu lists a variety of offerings, including jams, granola, tarts, cakes, cookies, cupcakes and brownies. Baral began baking in 2020, during the lockdown, and launched her online shop last year.She grows much of the produce she incorporates into her baking, and believes we should all understand the origins of our food. “This connection fosters gratitude and a deeper appreciation for nature,” she says. Her background in environmental science, coupled with her affinity for the natural world, imbues her creations with a unique artistic sensibility. Each item she bakes is a testament to her creativity and experimentation, as she believes consistent practice is the key to mastery.Despite the demands of being a full-time student, Baral strives to accommodate orders, typically requiring a minimum of 72 hours' notice for delivery. She is a passionate and discerning individual, evident in the love she infuses into her baking. Additionally, Baral advocates for a zero-waste policy at home, ensuring that every scrap of food and all household items are recycled.Three easy to bake recipes you can try at homeMini carrot cakes Ingredients:38 g milk or yoghurt35 g all-purpose flour1/4 tea spoon ground cinnamon1/8 tea spoon ground gingerA pinch of cardamom1 tea spoon baking powder½ tea spoon fine sea salt2 large eggs, at room temperature27 g granulated sugar13 g brown sugar (or 39 g of regular granulated sugar)1 tea spoon vanilla extract27 g extra virgin olive oil33 g carrots, peeled and shreddedChopped walnutsCandied lemon or orange slices (optional for garnish)Cream cheese frosting56.5 g unsalted butter, softened113.5 g cream cheese, softened1/2 teaspoon vanilla extractA pinch of salt250 g powdered sugarDirections:For the cake:Preheat the oven to 195°C.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nKhokana, a village near Kathmandu, boasts historical architecture, goat trails to Sikali Temple, mustard oil mills, and the preserved Newari culture with Guthi houses and ponds.\nA filmmaker's journey to Everest Base Camp highlights the importance of preparation, resilience, and the power of embracing the unknown, while emphasizing the fragility of life and the significance of finding meaning and purpose.\nA group of journalists embarked on a 1,000-km tour of Sri Lanka, visiting heritage sites, beaches, and a tea factory, witnessing the island's economic recovery and enduring beauty while learning about its ancient irrigation and cultural significance.\nNepal offers diverse cultural trails like the Mundhum Trek through Kirati villages and religious sites such as Janaki Mandir, scenic destinations like Kuri Village with panoramic Himalayan views, popular treks like the Annapurna Base Camp, wildlife havens like Bardiya National Park with Royal Bengal Tigers, pristine nature in Khaptad National Park, and remote valleys like Limi Valley.\nA nostalgic return to Phidim reveals a transformed hometown marred by departing residents but an influx of pilgrims, marking a transition from rustic charm to urbanized identity.\nNepal National Women's Volleyball team defeated India for the first time in history in the CAVA Women's Volleyball Nations League.\nAt least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.The death toll, which includes at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets to demand the scrapping of quotas for government jobs.The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month. It also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasina's biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Demonstrators blocked major highways on Sunday as student protesters launched a non-cooperation programme to press for the government's resignation, and violence spread nationwide.“Those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilize the nation,” Hasina said after a national security panel meeting, attended by the chiefs of the army, navy, air force, police, and other agencies.“I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand.”Police stations and ruling party offices were targeted as violence rocked the country of 170 million people.Thirteen policemen were beaten to death in the north-western district of Sirajganj, police said. Nine others were killed in the district, where two lawmakers' homes were set on fire.At least 11 people, including two students and a ruling party leader, were killed and dozens injured amid fierce clashes in several places in the capital, Dhaka, police and witnesses said.India's foreign ministry urged its nationals not to travel to Bangladesh until further notice.BULLET WOUNDSTwo construction workers were killed on their way to work and 30 injured in the central district of Munsiganj, during a three-way clash of protesters, police, and ruling party activists, witnesses said.“They were brought dead to the hospital with bullet wounds,” said Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal, the superintendent of the district hospital.Police said they had not fired any live bullets.In the northeastern district of Pabna, at least three people were killed and 50 injured during a clash between protesters and activists of Hasina's ruling Awami League party, witnesses said.Eight each in Feni and Lakshmipur, six in Narsingdi, five in Rangpur, four in Magura, and the rest in several other districts, hospital officials said.“An attack on a hospital is unacceptable,” said Health Minister Samanta Lal Sen after a group vandalized a medical college hospital and set fire to vehicles, including an ambulance, in Dhaka.At least four garment factories were set on fire in Ashulia, on the outskirts of Dhaka, police said.For the second time during the recent protests, the government shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Bangladesh authorities instructed the country’s telecoms providers on Sunday to shut down 4G, effectively disabling internet services, according to a confidential government memo seen by Reuters.“You are requested to shut down all your 4G services until further notice, only 2G will be effective,” said the document issued by the National Telecommunication Monitoring Center, a government intelligence agency.Telecoms companies were previously told their licenses would be cancelled if they did not comply with government orders, a person with direct knowledge told Reuters.The telecom regulatory body did not respond to Reuters' calls.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed.“I think the genie is out of the bottle and Hasina may not put it back in the bottle again,” said Shakil Ahmed, associate professor for government and politics at Jahangirnagar University.Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman on Saturday directed his officers to ensure the security of people's lives, properties, and important state installations under all circumstances, a statement said.“(The) Bangladesh Army is a symbol of the people's trust. The army is always there and will always be there for the people's interests and for any needs of the state,” the statement quoted him as saying.Zaman will brief the media on Monday, an army spokesman said. \nAt least 27 people were killed and scores injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday, as police fired tear gas and lobbed stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.The interior ministry declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is its biggest test since deadly protests erupted after Hasina won a fourth straight term in January elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force to stamp out the movement, a charge she and her ministers deny.Demonstrators blocked major highways on Sunday as student protesters launched a non-cooperation program to press for the government's resignation, and violence spread nationwide.“Those who are protesting on the streets right now are not students, but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation,” Hasina said after a national security panel meeting.“I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand.”Two construction workers were killed on their way to work and 30 injured in the central district of Munsiganj, during a three-way clash of protesters, police and ruling party activists, witnesses said.“They were brought dead to the hospital with bullet wounds,” said Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal, the superintendent of the district hospital.CLASHESPolice said they had not fired any bullets, however, when some improvised explosives were detonated and the area turned into a battleground.In the northeastern district of Pabna, at least three people were killed and 50 injured during a clash between protesters and activists of Hasina's ruling Awami League, witnesses said.Two more were killed in violence in the northern district of Bogura, and 20 were killed in nine other districts, hospital officials said.“An attack on a hospital is unacceptable,” said Health Minister Samanta Lal Sen after a group vandalised a medical college hospital and set fire to vehicles, including an ambulance, in Dhaka, the capital. “Everyone should refrain from this.”For the second time during the recent protests, the government shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said, while social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Last month, at least 150 people were killed, thousands injured and about 10,000 arrested in violence touched off by demonstrations led by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHumans have gambled throughout history. It is one of the oldest activities that people across the world, irrespective of how advanced and sophisticated their social and cultural histories are, have engaged in and clung to. Indeed, gambling has been so pervasive in the human consciousness that it has assumed precision and advancement, including its harnessing by technology.Gambling was prevalent in ancient India, China, Rome, Egypt, Peru and Japan. Late 19th century historians found evidence of “gaming tables engraved or scratched on the marble or stone slabs, for the amusement of idle men, always ready to cheat each other out of their money” in ancient Rome. Over time, the acceptance of gambling varied from culture to culture.In the ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata, the reference to the game of the dice was central to the unmaking of a princely clan which put everything—including their kingdom and their queen—at stake. It is a prime instance of gambling’s so-called immorality and the social and economic harm that it can cause.Gambling is essentially a game of chance or hazard. While in the past it was viewed as recreation and entertainment—it remains so across many countries—more recent scholarly studies increasingly view the motives for gambling as highly complex. At the same time, problem or pathological gambling is seen as an addiction and, therefore, a mental health problem, with socially and financially destructive consequences.So culturally embedded gambling has been in India that card games, with money on stake, is a routine feature in households celebrating the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, during Diwali, the festival lights. Crude gambling games such as teen patti and matka continue to be played in India’s crowded megacities even as online gambling sites and betting apps have boomed with the penetration of technology. A recent study found that the illegal betting market receives as much as $US100 billion in annual deposits.In India, betting and gambling are strictly prohibited under the Public Gambling Act, and are considered illegal across most regions. However, successive Indian central governments have taken little interest in enforcing a blanket ban with the only legal forms of gambling being state-run lotteries, horse racing, rummy card games and casinos.More recently, the Indian Central Consumer Protection Authority issued an advisory prohibiting advertising, promotion and endorsement of unlawful activities. With this, the authority sought to caution that advertisements or endorsements of activities otherwise prohibited by law shall be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. It warned that any violation of the guidelines would invite “stringent measures”.In the West, the mental health consequences of gambling have been extensively studied, but the subject has not been a focus of interest for researchers in India even as compulsive betting in cricket matches (since the early 1990s) and now the proliferation of online betting micro-sites and apps indicate. It is generally accepted that a “bad beat”—significant financial loss at gambling—acts as a “catalyst” for a condition known as problem gambling. Several consecutive losses can “disorient perceptions” and lead to a continuing pattern of financial setbacks which, in turn, causes mental health disorders, including substance abuse, anxiety and depression, that need prolonged psychiatric and other treatments.The permissiveness of gambling varies from country to country. Each country can address the issue of gambling in general, and problem or compulsive gambling in particular, from their own cultural perspectives. On a general plane, experts suggest greater legislation and funding is needed on prevention, awareness, treatment and research, particularly in India. Government, private and charitable efforts to mitigate the mental health impact of gambling need to be more responsible. More importantly, instead of dismissing or challenging research findings, online gaming industry members can address the problem of gambling with more coordinated efforts.-360info \nEvery time someone mentions “business plan,” I think about two of the major projects of my life—the discussion series run by Martin Chautari and the academic journal Studies in Nepali History and Society (SINHAS). When I was involved in expanding the work of the mangalbare discussion group of Chautari and in founding SINHAS, both in 1995, no one asked me what the business plans for these projects were. If anyone had asked, I would have had to tell them they did not exist. And if the existence of such plans were a prerequisite for these projects, they would have never taken off to become important platforms for public discourse and academic publications related to Nepal. I wrote about the discussion series in an earlier column of the Post (“Chautari guff at 32”, November 10, 2023).The idea of SINHAS emanated from a spontaneous proposal made by our publisher, Madhab Lal Maharjan, to me when I was visiting his shop, Mandala Book Point, some day in 1994. I made no immediate commitment to him. I returned to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in late 1994 to complete my doctoral dissertation. The final decision to start SINHAS was made in the summer of 1995 following conversations between Mary Des Chene, Mark Liechty and myself in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Lazima Onta-Bhatta was invited to join the team. We decided that each journal volume would consist of two issues—each about 200 pages thick—published in June and December of each year. Then, Madhab and we made a simple oral agreement: The editors would prepare the “camera-ready” copy of each issue, and he would publish, distribute and sell it. The first issue of SINHAS was published in August 1996. A “foolish” decisionReflecting on the decision to start SINHAS, I would say that it represented the collective “foolishness” of the four founding editors. How so?Think about the “standing” of the founding team in 1995: Here were four people, two of whom were early career post-PhD researchers, and the other two doctoral students still writing their dissertations. The most senior of the lot, Mary, had finished her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1991 with a dissertation titled “Relics of Empire: A Cultural History of the Gurkhas, 1815-1987.” She published an article in the Himalayan Research Bulletin in 1992 and a second one in the South Asia Bulletin in 1993. In 1995, apart from teaching, she was crafting articles for other journals and edited volumes. She had published at least two book reviews in academic journals by then, and might have even peer-reviewed a manuscript or two for some journals.The second post-PhD researcher in our team, Mark Liechty, obtained his PhD in anthropology from UPenn in December 1994, writing a dissertation titled “Fashioning Modernity in Kathmandu: Mass Media, Consumer Culture, and the Middle Class in Nepal.” He had spent the first six months of 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands. While there, he finished the final draft of his article, “Kathmandu as Translocality: Multiple Places in a Nepali Space,” published in 1996 in the edited volume Geography of Identity. Before going to Leiden, Mark finished another article on youth identities and the experience of modernity in Kathmandu, published in 1995 in the edited volume Youth Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Hence, by mid-1995, although two of his articles in two separate edited volumes were in various stages of the pre-press process, Mark had not even submitted an article to a journal for review. He published a book review in 1993 but does not remember doing any official peer reviews for any journal until then.In July 1995, I was still a year away from finishing my PhD in history at UPenn. During the hot summer of 1995 in Philadelphia, I was writing my dissertation, “The Politics of Bravery: A History of Nepali Nationalism.” Some months earlier, I had published a full-length article under the title “Rich Possibilities: Notes on Social History in Nepal” in Contributions to Nepalese Studies, which was the most prominent journal of Nepal Studies at that time. That submission had not undergone a rigorous peer review process but was finely copy-edited before publication. By then, I had published reviews of academic books in three journals. Still, I had not done any official peer review of any article manuscript written by others for any journal. In the early summer of 1995, Lazima, the fourth founder of SINHAS, was still doing her anthropological fieldwork in Kathmandu on the subject of street children. At that time, she had not published anything in academic journals. Later that year, she returned to the US to begin writing her doctoral dissertation, which eventually got submitted to Cornell University in 2000 under the title “Street Children’s Subcultures and Cultural Politics of Childhood in Nepal.” So here was a group of four researchers—two early post-doctoral ones and two doctoral students—who had certainly read thousands of journal articles between them during their graduate training but whose collective experience of writing for academic journals was limited to just three published full-length articles in total! Three members of this group had never done an official peer review of any article manuscript submitted to any journal. None of them had worked as a proper editorial assistant in any academic journal team previously. In other disciplinary domains, early career researchers cut their journal editing teeth by working first as junior members of the editorial collective of some journals. Later on, they are offered associate and eventually full editorial positions in those same or other journals. But here was our team, deciding to establish a new journal of Nepal Studies without such experience. Surely, we were well read in Nepali history and society, but collectively, we had minimal knowledge of the intricate processes that generate academic journals. Hence, the decision to establish SINHAS was a “foolish” reflection of the collective youth and naivety of the four founding editors.Portable lessonsGiven its current standing among practitioners of Nepal Studies, I would have to say that SINHAS has done pretty well in its 29 years of existence despite not having a “business plan.” We have learnt to run the journal while securing and editing good articles that enhance our collective understanding of Nepali history and society. That raises this question: Does every project in life need a business plan? I clearly don’t think so. For many aspects of how a democratic society ought to function, we probably need individuals committed long-term to specific ideas and projects more than business plans for them. Such individuals should have the freedom to “foolishly” launch public-serving projects without worrying about business plans. I am glad that back in 1995, I did not have to respond to folks who were married to the idea of business plans for everything, whether a discussion forum or a journal. There should be ample room for spontaneity, public-serving naivety and experiential serendipity in any society that likes to call itself loktantrik.   \nA swollen and roaring Trishuli River swept away two passenger buses on July 12. The fact that the buses and most of the passengers are yet to be found has compounded the tragedy and grief of the families. The failure of rescue groups in this incident indicates that our existing mechanisms and disaster preparedness need to be revised, and the country needs heightened vigilance in the coming days.Right since the accident, the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force, and the Nepal Army have tirelessly toiled in search and rescue on Simaltal section of the Muglin-Narayanghat road and subsequently in other areas too. However, locating the bus and passengers in the raging river is proving to be as hard as searching for a needle in a haystack. The experienced rescuers from the Indian National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) joined their Nepali counterparts with two magnets weighing 19 kg and 14 kg each and advanced sonar devices but they had to return empty-handed. Officials say they are now mulling over reaching out to its northern neighbour, China, for some help.Nepali rescuers’ efforts are praiseworthy, but they are apparently ill-equipped both in terms of skills and advanced tools for the intended goal. Much time was wasted in the initial days of the Simaltal incident; when the Indian team arrived, it was too late for them to make much difference. While there is nothing wrong in asking for help from our two neighbours, effective disaster management begins at a community or local level. People in the vicinity should be equipped to immediately mobilise after such disasters with the right sets of tools and knowhow. What’s concerning is that such a deadly incident in Trisuli is not isolated. Over the past eight years, as reported in Nepalkhabar, 55 people have gone missing aboard 21 vehicles that plunged into the Trishuli River on the Muglin-Narayanghat road and the Muglin-Mowakhola section of the Prithvi highway. Similarly, six vehicles lost in the past 32 years have never been found. This suggests something is badly amiss in disaster preparedness on our treacherous highways. The monsoon this year has been harsh, and rainfall patterns are ever-changing. Amid this, the authorities have tried to evade their responsibility of building engineeringly sound roads, heeding experts and arranging for right tools for search and rescue. Poor roads and haphazard road construction, in turn, result in landslides. Due to random road construction, and expansion projects that involve bulldozing the cliffs/hills adjoining the roads, the risk of disasters in most of Nepal’s highways continues to be high. Many stretches on the Muglin-Narayanghat Road and Prithvi Highway are in the red zone, and they need proper monitoring and surveillance as well as dedicated human and financial resources to prepare for a disaster that might occur any time of the year. Besides, the government should prioritise upskilling the rescuers in line with the changing weather patterns and disaster types.If the government doesn’t learn from the Simaltal tragedy and plan its disaster preparedness and responses accordingly, no highway or season in Nepal will be safe to travel. The wait-and-see approach and the tendency to swing into action only after the fact will continue to exact a heavy toll in terms of human deaths and injuries. \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee on Monday rejected the Constitutional Council’s nomination of Krishna Man Pradhan as election commissioner. Rights bodies, media and common folks had been closely following the committee’s deliberations. They were trying to gauge whether the committee would endorse the nominee who had been accused by a woman of years of sexual exploitation. Appearing before the committee, the woman narrated how Pradhan had sexually abused her and why he was morally unfit to hold a respectable constitutional position. After listening to the woman and interrogating the nominee, the joint panel of the federal parliament finally rejected Pradhan for the position. Of course, you could argue that the panel had it easy as Pradhan had already pulled out of the race to be the commissioner when he realised that the woman had a strong case against him. Yet that would be a simplistic reading. The reason Pradhan pulled out was the intense scrutiny that the parliamentary hearing process had put him under. There are differing views on the relevance of parliamentary hearings in Nepal. The Constitutional Council, which picks the officials for constitutional bodies, is an all-powerful entity headed by the prime minister and comprising Speaker, National Assembly chair, chief justice, leader of the main opposition and deputy speaker. It involves not only heads of executive, legislative and judiciary but also that of the opposition party. So, one argument is that a person picked by such a powerful entity need not again be vetted by a parliamentary committee. But, historically, top leaders in the council are guided mainly by the ethos of political bhagbanda (sharing of seats). Its decisions have often courted controversy. It would often happen that when a member of the council didn’t get to pick those close to them, the member would be absent from the council meeting, thus hindering its functioning. In 2020, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister during his second term, he even changed the provisions of the Constitutional Council Act, just so he could make over four dozen appointments including heads and members of several constitutional bodies. The decision couldn’t be crosschecked at the hearing committee as Oli had already dissolved the House of Representatives. Lawyers challenged the move in the court but the issue is still sub-judice. It is only in a rare case that the House committee rejects the council’s recommendation. Pradhan’s rejection however is not the first. If the House wasn’t in session, Pradhan’s recommendation would have automatically been passed and he would have by now become an election commissioner. It is because the committee has a system to seek complaints, if any, from the public about the nominee that a victim could reach out to the lawmakers and inform them about his wrongdoings. Thus a wrong man has been stopped from holding an important position. The committee however over the years failed to gain public trust as it is seen as no more than a rubber-stamp of powerful leaders. It should be able to dispel such beliefs by taking more bold decisions. The goal, as some argue, should not be to do away with the parliamentary hearing altogether. It should rather be to make the process so effective that the council would think many times before making questionable recommendations.  \nAsked by a young Nepali woman why more and more students are going abroad for higher studies, the envoy of a country that hosts one of the biggest populations of Nepali students replied: “Young people like to travel.” The ambassador was implying that even if Nepal had a far better education system than it currently does, as well as a decent job market, many young people would still jet off to faraway lands. There is thus no easy way to make young Nepalis stay back in their own country, either to work or to study. The best the country can hope is that at least some of its youths who get a good education or valuable work experience abroad come back and do something worthwhile in their homeland. There are ways to encourage this trend. The national economy needs to grow at a decent clip, putting more disposable income in people’s hands and boosting enterprises and industries. More than that, having policy stability will allow businesses to plan long-term. It’s a virtuous cycle. Yet, even in the best-case scenario, a touch of realism is warranted: There is only so much a developing state like Nepal can do to keep its youth rooted in their country—if such a policy is advisable.Japan seems to be the new destination of choice for Nepali students. In the just-completed fiscal year, over 112,000 students obtained the ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs) from the Ministry of Education. (Such letters are mandatory for Nepali students to study abroad.) The ministry issued over 34,000 NOCs for Japan, followed by over 15,000 for Canada, over 14,000 for Australia, over 13,000 for the UK, and a touch over 11,000 for the US. The appeal of Japan has been steadily rising as education there is relatively cheaper compared to studying in Western countries and a Nepali student in Japan can work for up to 28 hours a week. Interestingly, the high influx of foreign students has sparked a debate in Japan, traditionally a closed country, on the costs and benefits of accepting migrants of all kinds. Pretty much the same thing is happening in Australia, which has over the past year tightened its rules for foreign students. As Australia tightened its borders, Nepali students seem to have shifted to Japan. So, again, part of the reason Nepali students go abroad is undoubtedly economic. Yet it is far from the whole story. Rather than looking to keep young folks in the country at all costs, the goal could rather be to build a capable network of people of Nepali origin, wherever they are in the world, and harness this collective power for the country’s good. For instance, Nepalis in North America collaborated to push for the Nepal Open University, the distance learning public university established in 2016. As the gig economy takes off and studying online gains popularity, distance learning gives people the flexibility to juggle their study, work and other commitments. The potential for such collaboration is endless, if only the host country creates the right environment. Moreover, even as it is, there is a steady stream of young professionals coming back to Nepal from abroad and setting up their own businesses and ventures. Perhaps the time has come to rethink the whole debate around the ‘brain drain’ from Nepal. \nThe new coalition government, led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, faced a huge public backlash when it appointed only two women and not a single Dalit in the 22-member Council of Ministers. The same government, however, garnered praise in a matter of days when Prime Minister Oli appointed Lila Devi Badtaula as the Nepal government’s first female Chief Secretary. While undeniably historic in a country where men are at the forefront of leadership positions, it is difficult to ignore the political context surrounding Badtaula’s selection, which came amid a public outcry over the severe underrepresentation of women in the Cabinet. Her appointment at the end of her career and only when former chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal was suspended—outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Badtaula an acting chief secretary on July 15—is suggestive of the disregard for having women in top positions when men are around. This raises questions about whether Badtaula’s promotion was no more than a tactical move to quell public discontent. The prime minister, silent about the biases in Cabinet, boasted on Facebook on Saturday, “I saw many friends writing about Nepali women who have reached high leadership positions on social media yesterday. I am also pleased with these four coincidences that became possible under my positive initiative”. The pictures showed the first female President, Bidhya Devi Bhandari; the first female Chief Justice, Sushila Karki; the first woman speaker in the House of Representatives, Onsari Gharti; and Badtaula—all of whom were appointed during Oli’s government leadership at different times. We also have another unforgettable name Sewa Lamsal (the first female foreign secretary), at present. The world is forging ahead towards gender inclusivity, bringing more women to the fore, be it in politics or administration, and Nepal also seems somewhat committed to it. The country has significantly improved women’s political representation, who now occupy 91 seats in the 275-member federal parliament. And apart from politics, as per the Department of National Personnel Records, out of 85,513 civil service employees, 20.64 percent are female; seven are secretaries besides the chief secretary. Even so, genuine gender equality and inclusion is far from ensured. These seemingly “historic” achievements, each carrying the tag “the first woman,” however, fail to represent a whole lot of Nepali women. It is uncertain whether more women will consistently fill the positions left by their ‘female firsts’. As concerning is the exclusion of women from marginalised communities in the top roles, where the Khas-Arya dominate.Things won’t improve much unless more women are elected through first-past-the-post or direct elections—in the 2022 elections just nine women were directly elected—and unless women stopped being played as token cards. And this will never come without political leaders’ willingness to change. As men dominate Nepali politics, women are “given” positions. Tokenism will never lead to women’s empowerment and equality; it will in fact prove detrimental to the realisation of our gender-equal dreams. True gender equality requires more than symbolic gestures; it demands substantive change in our behaviour in how we treat women both at home and in public positions. As of yet, political positions are seen as something that only men can handle, and women are largely sidelined or dismissed. Because of this, not many women aspire to be politicians or top administrators. This structural discrimination against women undermines the constitutional spirit of equality of opportunity for people of all genders and socio-economic backgrounds. Not only is this immoral but also illegal.  \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nNepal is experiencing monsoon weather with partly cloudy conditions, light to moderate rainfall, and possible heavy rainfall in Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi provinces; temperatures ranged from 14.5°C to 35.7°C.\nLight to heavy rainfall with thunder and lightning is expected throughout Nepal today and tonight, with the highest recorded temperature being 35.5 degrees Celsius in Bhairahawa and the lowest recorded temperature being 15 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.\nFriday's weather forecast predicts scattered light to moderate rain, heavy rainfall in some areas, and wind gusts in certain regions, with temperatures ranging from 13.5°C to 36.4°C.\nPartly or generally cloudy weather with rain predicted across most provinces, with heavy rainfall possible in specific areas, while Simara and Jomsom experience temperature extremes.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.

Write it in the form of inspiring story not news article or event.\n    \n    Story:\nOnce upon a time, nestled between the towering peaks of the Himalayas and the lush jungles of the Terai, there was a country named Nepal. Though still a developing nation, Nepal was a land of profound beauty and deep-rooted cultural heritage. The residents of Nepal faced many challenges, but beneath these hardships lay a resilient spirit and an unyielding hope for the future.\n\nThis enchanting land, where Mount Everest reaches towards the skies and the air carries a mix of incense and cool mountain breezes, was more than a geographical marvel. It was a mosaic of cultures, languages, and traditions, a testament to human endeavor against all odds. Nepal's history, from the unification under King Prithvi Narayan Shah to its transformation into a federal democratic republic, told a story of aspiration and endurance.\n\nIn recent years, the people of Nepal, with their indomitable will, had taken strides towards rebuilding and reimagining their country. They turned their struggles into stepping stones, each challenge a chapter in their ongoing saga. The shift from a monarchy to a republic had not only changed governance but had woven a new tapestry of democratic values and collective decision-making.\n\nEconomically, while agriculture continued to sustain a large part of its population, Nepal had begun to harness the potential of its picturesque landscapes, developing sustainable tourism that promised to preserve their natural heritage while boosting local economies. Communities living in the shadows of the Himalayas had become stewards of the earth, protecting the biodiversity that made their country unique.\n\nEach day brought new stories. Whether it was a festival in Kathmandu, a technological advance in Pokhara, or a conservation effort in Chitwan, these events were threads in the vibrant quilt of Nepali life. These stories, updated daily, reflected the pulse of progress and the spirit of hope that characterized this resilient nation.\n\nAnd so, as Nepal moved forward, each moment was not just a passage of time but a promise of potential, a narrative of a nation perennially climbing towards tomorrow, guided by the legacy of its past and the dreams of its future.\n\nNews events:\nCome autumn, Nepal will deploy heavy lifter drones to transport garbage from the 6,812-metre tall Ama Dablam, south of Everest. This will be the first commercial work an unmanned aerial vehicle does in Nepal’s high-altitude zone.The heavy lifter from China’s biggest drone maker, Da Jiang Innovations (DJI), will take on tasks traditionally handled by Sherpas. Officials believe it will help reduce casualties on Everest.Then, in spring (March-May), DJI drones, which make sounds similar to a swarm of bees, will be put to work on Everest.It will fly to Camp I (5,943 metres) to supply ropes and ladders to prepare routes and bring garbage to the Everest base camp at 5,364 metres.On Sunday, a tripartite memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed between the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee, the Khumbu Pasang Lhamu Rural Municipality, and the Airlift Technology Pvt Ltd for the use of advanced drone technology to efficiently manage garbage in the mountains of the Khumbu region.In April, Chinese drone maker DJI conducted the world’s first drone delivery test on Everest.“After a successful test in April, we plan to use drones commercially in the Everest region,” said Jagat Bhusal, chief administration officer of the rural municipality that hosts Everest. The test result showed that the DJI FlyCart 30, the long-distance heavy lifter drone, could airlift 234 kg per hour between Camp I and Base Camp, a task usually accomplished by at least 14 porters in six hours. Drone manufacturer DJI is under the microscope as US lawmakers push for a ban on Chinese drones, amid deteriorating relations between the US and China, the world’s largest trading nations.Nepali officials and mountaineers, however, see the drone as a life-saving vehicle.Traditionally, local Sherpa guides are responsible for transporting supplies and clearing trash on Everest. They may need to cross the icefall over 30 times a season to transport supplies such as oxygen bottles, gas canisters, tents, food, and ropes.All climbers and guides must navigate the icefall on the route to the world’s tallest peak. The icefall is so notoriously dangerous that even experienced Sherpas hesitate to move when the sun shines.The Khumbu Icefall, a river of ice a kilometre or so long, is usually crossed at night or early morning, with climbers putting headlamps on their helmets.Normally, the route is crossed early in the morning, when the ice blocks and the hanging glaciers are stable and avalanche risks are low.During the day, as the sun warms the mountain, the hanging glaciers melt, and ice crumbles, increasing the risk of avalanche.“Using drones will help us avoid the dangers in the Khumbu Icefall,” said Bhusal. On April 18, 2014, an avalanche resulting from a falling serac buried 16 Sherpa guides in the Khumbu Icefall, eventually leading to the cancellation of the season’s expeditions.Last year, three Sherpa guides mobilised to prepare the routes were buried under the ice masses triggered by an avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall. Their bodies are yet to be recovered.The Himalayan Database and the government records show that nearly 50 individuals died on the icefall between 1953 and 2023.The climb from Everest Base Camp to Camp I takes six hours. Between these two camps lies the Khumbu Icefall, the most treacherous part of the route.The most exciting and easiest part of the route is reaching Camp II (6,400 metres), which takes four hours from Camp I.There is a set of restrictions in the mountains for carrying loads.According to government rules, workers climbing high altitudes must not carry loads exceeding 20kg between 5,000 and 6,000 metres, 17 kg between 6,001 and 7,000 metres, 14 kg between 7,001 to 8,000 metres, and 12 kg for altitudes above 8,000 metres.“Yes, there are concerns that the machines may actually cut jobs. But our sole purpose is to reduce potential deaths in the Khumbu Icefall, the danger zone,” said Bhusal.“We will train Sherpas, as drone operators cannot handle tasks at the higher camps. In the future, all work will be done by Sherpas.” In the trial phase, the drone could lift 30 kg from Camp I. However, its performance dropped to 18 kg from Camp II. “Based on the MoU framework, we will soon sign a commercial agreement with the drone supplier,” said Bhusal. “The municipality will monitor all the activities.”The municipality has, so far, spent Rs800,000 on the trial. Climate change is melting snow and ice, exposing even more garbage and bodies that have been covered for decades on Everest. This waste pollutes the natural environment and poses a severe health risk to everyone who lives in the Everest watershed.Nearly 100 tonnes of garbage were collected during this spring climbing season from Everest and Lhotse, which share the same base camp.According to the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee (SPCC), 77.19 tonnes of waste was collected from the Everest base camp alone during the Spring 2024 climbing season. With 8-9 tonnes coming from the higher camps brought down by the expedition agencies, the SPCC collected 85 tonnes of waste this spring.The breakdown of collected waste shows burnable garbage at 27.99 tonnes, recyclable garbage at 7.51 tonnes, human waste at 27.53 tonnes, and kitchen waste at 14.15 tonnes. The Nepal Army also collected over 11 tonnes of garbage. In Spring 2023, the SPCC managed nearly 70 tonnes of waste from expedition groups.Insiders say the Everest Base Camp has become more luxurious, leading to an accumulation of people and garbage. Nearly 60,000 people trek to the Base Camp annually.Since 2015, the SPCC has enforced the 8 kg garbage rule, requiring every climber ascending the Everest base camp to return with at least 8 kg of garbage. Visitors to Everest must also pay a $4,000 garbage deposit, which is refunded if the person returns with 8 kg.Before this year’s climbing season, the Supreme Court issued a mandamus order directing the government to regulate the rising number of expeditions on the world’s tallest mountain.The court order followed frequent traffic jams and increasing trash on Everest, which has even been called the ‘world's highest garbage dump’.“Drones can replace helicopters as a relatively low-risk transport vehicle to supplement supplies on the plateau, which will greatly expand the application space of UAVs,” Cai Yong, a senior engineer at East China Normal University, told Xinhua, the state news agency of China, after the April test.In recent years, more electric drones have been used in agriculture and forestry, power line inspection, logistics, and emergency rescue, and each breakthrough will help save human and material resources and protect the safety of life and property, Jin Wei, deputy secretary-general of the China UAV Industry Innovation Alliance, told Xinhua.The April tests used the DJI FlyCart 30 to fly three bottles of oxygen and 1.5 kg of other supplies from the base camp to Camp I of the world's highest peak and to carry garbage down on the return trip.During the tests, the DJI FlyCart 30 flew up to 6,191.8 metres on Everest, which straddles the Nepal-China border.  \nDespite a parliamentary resolution mandating an end to Dalit discrimination and proportional representation in state agencies, successive Nepali governments have failed to include Dalits in the Cabinet or ensure their adequate representation in other state structures, sparking protests from Dalit lawmakers.\nPrime Minister Oli, the CPN-UML's chairman, warns against factionalism within the party, while some leaders accuse him of promoting it despite a lack of open challenges to his authority.\nResearch and initiatives aim to address the challenges of water resource management and ecosystem conservation in Nepal's rivers, particularly in urban areas, highlighting the importance of respecting natural river systems, integrating knowledge systems, and addressing the impacts of urbanization and encroachment to protect rivers and their vital role for human and environmental well-being.\nNepal's women's volleyball team lost 2-3 to Iran in the 2024 CAVA Nations League, despite having already qualified for the semi-finals.\nDue to political turmoil in Bangladesh, Nepal's border with India has heightened security to prevent illegal infiltration of third-country citizens, particularly after Bangladeshi PM's resignation amid ongoing unrest.\nThe Nepali embassy in Dhaka halts operations amid Bangladesh's unrest after Prime Minister Hasina's resignation.\nBoth tunnels at Dhedre, Makawanpur, along the under-construction Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway have achieved breakthroughs.A 1.728-km-long tunnel (Kathmandu-Nijgadh) achieved a breakthrough on Monday. Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli pressed a switch to detonate explosives for a breakthrough. A 1.653-km-long tunnel (Nijgadh-Kathmandu) breakthrough on the expressway was achieved on May 24.It is the fourth tunnel breakthrough in the Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway which connects the capital city with Nijgadh in southern Nepal with a 76-km highway.Both tunnels at Lendanda have also achieved breakthroughs. A 1,612-metre tunnel, one of the twin-tube tunnels in Lendanda, located in Bakaiya and Gadhi rural municipalities of Makawanpur, made a breakthrough on July 4. Earlier, on May 24, a 1.653-km-long tunnel breakthrough was achieved.Twin tunnels, the longest in the project, are being constructed at Mahadevtar. Of the 3.3 km of tunnel (Kathmandu-Nijgadh), 2.28 km have been cleared. Similarly, of the 3.32 km of tunnel (Nijgadh-Kathmandu), 2.09 km have been cleared so far.The Kathmandu-Tarai Expressway, or fast track, connects the capital city and Nijgadh in southern Nepal. Once completed, it will cut the current travel time by several hours. With 11 km in bridges and six km in tunnels, the expressway is more complex than any road construction project Nepal has undertaken before.The Nepal government formally handed over the project, under the Department of Roads, to the Nepal Army on May 4, 2017. The national force started building the multi-billion-rupee project in August of the same year, with a four-year completion target.So far, the expressway has made overall progress of 35.38 percent. \nBangladesh Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned and fled the country on Monday after hundreds of people were killed in a crackdown on demonstrations that began as protests against job quotas and swelled into a movement demanding her downfall.Jubilant, cheering crowds stormed into the opulent grounds of the presidential residence unopposed, carrying out looted furniture and TVs. One man balanced a red velvet, gilt-edged chair on his head. Another held an armful of vases.Elsewhere in Dhaka, protesters climbed atop a statue of Hasina's father, state founder Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe.The flight into exile ended a 15-year second stint in power for Hasina, who has ruled for 20 of the last 30 years as leader of the political movement inherited from her father, assassinated with most of his family in a 1975 coup.Army chief General Waker-Uz-Zaman announced Hasina's resignation in a televised address to the nation and said an interim government would be formed. He called for peace and promised justice for those killed in weeks of unrest.He said he had held talks with leaders of major political parties - excluding Hasina's long-ruling Awami League - and would soon meet President Mohammed Shahabuddin to discuss the way ahead.India's ANI news agency said Hasina, 76, landed at a military airfield near Delhi. Reuters could not immediately verify this, but commercial tracking services showed a Bangladesh Air Force plane leaving the country and flying west before it disappeared.“The country is going through a revolutionary period,” said Zaman, 58, who had taken over as army chief only on June 23.“I promise you all, we will bring justice to all the murders and injustice. We request you to have faith in the army of the country. I take full responsibility and I assure you to not get disheartened,” he said. “I request you all to be a little patient, give us some time and together we will be able to solve all the problems,” Zaman added. “Please don't go back to the path of violence and please return to non-violent and peaceful ways.”Bangladesh has been engulfed by violence since student protests last month against the quotas, which reserve some public sector jobs for veterans of Bangladesh's 1971 independence war, seen as favouring allies of the ruling party.The protests escalated into a campaign demanding the overthrow of Hasina, and were met by a violent crackdown in which about 250 people have been killed and thousands injured.She had won a fourth straight term only in January this year in an election boycotted by the main opposition party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party of her nemesis Begum Khaleda Zia.Hasina had ruled since winning a decades-long power struggle with Zia in 2009. The two women each inherited political movements from slain rulers - in Hasina's case, from her father Mujib; in Zia's case, from her husband Ziaur Rahman, who took power after Mujib's death and was himself assassinated in 1981.“Hasina’s resignation proves the power of the people,” said Tarique Rahman, the exiled eldest son of the two Zias who now serves as acting chairman of the opposition party.“Together, let’s rebuild Bangladesh into a democratic and developed nation, where the rights and freedoms of all people are protected,” he posted on X.WEEKS OF PROTESTS, VIOLENCEStudent activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign after clashes across the country on Sunday killed nearly 100 people.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not verify the report.Sunday's death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against the job quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 pm. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of Hasina's Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Bangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence. Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of world's top brands, have also been closed indefinitely.The role of the country's army in tackling the violence had come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Hasina had said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”. \nGeneral elections give the political parties the only real chance to test their popularity. What we have seen in the recent past is a clear preference of Nepal’s major forces for pre-poll alliances. With the country’s mixed electoral system unlikely to give any single party an absolute majority and thus a shot at forming the government on its own, what is the harm in jointly contesting elections with other parties? That, at least, is the argument of the proponents of such pre-election tie-ups. But in reality such pre-poll alliances smack of an utter lack of confidence and conviction. Nepali parties detest being in the opposition’s bench; there is no political culture of smaller parties accepting their limited mandate and waiting for the next five years for another shot at governing. So it makes sense for them to try to ensure, even before people head to the polls, to maximise their chances of being on the right side of the parliament’s aisle. What is more, such pre-poll alliances often come with the added bonus of safe seats for top leaders. But with parties professing vastly different ideologies standing on the same platform, the only message people get is that the country’s top parties are interested less in good governance and delivery than getting to power for its own sake. But lo and behold! All three of the country’s major parties—the Nepali Congress, the CPN-UML and the CPN (Maoist Centre)—have now publicly committed to single-handedly contest the 2027 general elections. That, we are afraid, is an unlikely prospect. The Maoist Centre, the latest of the Big Three to make such a declaration, could be wiped out at the next polls without other parties’ help. Pushpa Kamal Dahal, someone who has been at the party’s helm for 35 years—and by extension his Maoist Centre party—has lost all credibility with his pendulum-like political swings. The party, which once championed the causes of the marginalised and the downtrodden, is these days an ardent backer of the kind of crony capitalism it used to accuse the Congress and the UML of fostering. In the past elections, the Maoist Centre has allied with both the parties, to limited success. The benefits of such pre-poll alliances for the two biggest parties is questionable, too. It thus makes sense for these parties, including the Maoist Centre, to test their individual strength in upcoming elections. Despite the short-term risks, that would be the right thing to do, for the individual interests of these parties and for the larger good of Nepali democracy. People today are confused as they have no clear options at elections, and many of them choose not to vote. If instead the ballot papers reflect a clear choice between competing ideologies and agendas, it’s a whole new ballgame. The electorate can then make informed choices. For the political parties, the general elections offer a rare chance to test the strength of their programmes and leaders. Why lose this golden opportunity to do so and adapt accordingly for long-term success? Once individual parties know their real electoral strength, they can always join hands with other parties to form federal and provincial governments. Their public positions notwithstanding, do our political parties and their leaders have the self-belief to take the poll-plunge alone? People doubt it. But they will be happy to be proven wrong.   \nThe instant reaction to the Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 has been celebratory for the most part. How it will be judged in months and quarters to come remains to be seen. For now, the stock market has spoken. The Nepal Stock Exchange (NEPSE), which had already been rallying feverishly since early July, surged by 4.4 percent on July 28—the first day of trading after the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the country’s central bank, published the policy on July 26. The NRB has drawn accolades for adopting an expansionary policy. It lowered the benchmark interest rates, scrapped the Rs200 million margin-loan cap for institutional investors and reduced provisioning requirement for banks, among others.Stocks particularly reacted to the removal of the margin-loan ceiling for institutional investors. A brief history is in order: Three years ago, the 2021-22 monetary policy limited margin loan per customer to Rs40 million at one bank and Rs120 million at multiple banks. The NRB aimed to rein in the prevailing massive investor speculation back then. Soon after, the NEPSE tagged 3,227 in August 2021 and headed lower. The snorting bulls were up in arms and put all kinds of pressure on the Maha Prasad Adhikari-led central bank to roll back the cap, to no avail. Last October, the Rs120 million ceiling was upped to Rs150 million for individual investors and Rs200 million for institutional investors. Fast forward to now, and the cap for individual investors remains, but a limit no longer binds institutional investors. They can borrow as much as they wish. The NEPSE shot up by 35.5 percent in July to reach 2,761. Earlier, soon after it peaked in August 2021, it was rangebound between 1,800 and 2,200 before it broke out in the middle of last month. The July move looks parabolic, but volume is fully cooperating. As of mid-June, banks and financial institutions (20 commercial banks, 17 development banks and 17 finance companies) held Rs87.1 billion in margin loans, up from Rs76.5 billion as of mid-July last year. It is safe to assume that the latest monetary policy will embolden investors to take on additional leverage.Setting bad precedent Leaving aside the fact that leverage cuts both ways and contractions in leverage will hurt stocks, the current market momentum is up, and leverage can be beneficial. The NRB should closely monitor how the current bull will evolve and what kind of speculative mania this will spawn. Three years ago, the NEPSE continued to rise non-stop for over two years before it reached a record in August 2021. More important is whether the NRB leadership will have the willingness and the courage to tackle a scenario in which excessive leverage risks hurting investors and/or the economy. In this regard, Governor Adhikari withstood undue pressure from even former finance ministers who wanted looser margin-lending rules.Yuba Raj Khatiwada, the current economic adviser to Prime Minister KP Oli and former NRB governor, vice chairman of the National Planning Commission as well as finance minister, was one of several former finance ministers to openly call on the NRB to remove the margin-loan cap last year. Whether last month’s lifting of the Rs200 million cap for institutional investors was done at the sole discretion of the central bank or Khatiwada had a hand in it, we don’t know. This much we do know: The monetary policy, originally scheduled to come out on July 19, was delayed by a whole week. Apparently, on July 18, Khatiwada wanted to study the policy and borrowed it, causing the dillydally. This sets a bad precedent.According to the Nepal Rastra Bank Act 2002, (1) The objectives of the bank are (i) To formulate and manage monetary and foreign exchange policies in order to maintain price and balance of payment stability for the achievement of economic stability and sustainable development of the economy; (ii) To raise public confidence towards the banking and financial system by making the sectors stable and by increasing access to financial services; (iii) To develop a secure, healthy and efficient payment system. (2) The bank, without any prejudice to the objectives referred to in subsection 1, will extend cooperation in the implementation of economic policies of the government of Nepal.Restore central bank credibilityThe Act also states that the bank shall be an autonomous and corporate body with perpetual succession. Sub-section 2 nonetheless creates room for government intervention, particularly considering that the bank’s seven-member board of directors comprises the governor, two deputy governors, secretary at the Ministry of Finance and three others appointed by the government. If the newly appointed prime minister wanted to review the monetary policy, he should have done so via Finance Minister Bishnu Poudel. The Act states that any contact between the bank and the government should be made through the Ministry of Finance. It was wrong for Khatiwada to interject himself into this.Internal politics within the Oli-led NPC-UML may have played a role. Bishnu Poudel is the party's vice-chairman, while Shanker Pokharel is the general secretary. The two locked horns in July, trying to instil their loyal for the position of chief minister of Lumbini Province. In the end, with Oli’s blessing, Pokharel’s candidate won. It is logical to assume that Poudel and Khatiwada have different priorities for handling the stock market/economy. This, however, cannot justify Khatiwada’s intervention. The optics are jarring. Good governance, the rule of law and the end of corruption are some catchphrases thrown around in the Oli-led coalition government. Khatiwada’s faux pas is anything but good governance.Central banks live or die by credibility. The NRB’s primary responsibility is to carry out monetary policy. Fiscal policy falls under the purview of the government. By nature, politicians are driven by the next election cycle and would like good things—such as rising stock prices—to unfold during their time in power. In contrast, the NRB, as a regulator, cannot and should not wish for higher or lower prices; rather, it should focus on creating a durable investing environment. Bringing out a monetary policy a week later than the scheduled time does not help boost the confidence of foreign investors, largely because this was due to government intervention. Let the “independent” NRB stay independent. \nThe Annual Kathmandu Conference on Nepal and the Himalaya, organised by Social Science Baha, a research organisation in association with some institutions from Nepal and abroad, from July 24-26 in Kathmandu, was a huge success. My participation was minuscule in the event. I attended a few sessions and listened to some papers out of the 56 presented this year.Prof Nirmal Man Tuladhar, chair of Social Science Baha, naturally sounded proud while telling us about the growing popularity of the conference each year. I have not accessed a comprehensive analysis of the nature, size and features of the Baha conferences held in the metropolis. What I know is that they are well-attended and used by a wide cohort of researchers, scholars, dreamers and some freaks. That is, of course, the nature of conferences of such size anywhere in the world. The Baha conference is a focussed affair where senior scholars and PhD researchers converge. I was told some of them have already booked their conference seats for next year. Such is its popularity. They take up diverse themes like Nepal, the Himalayas, earth and ecology, nature, ideas, fieldwork methods, changing societies, mental problems, the agonies of Mother Earth, altitudes and human behaviours. This paints a picture of diversity. Serious and dedicated discussants and audiences give conferences a special character. There is no time for little breaks either in the day or night for a few rounds of poetry readings and music performances. No painter rushes with brush and palette. It would be a diversion. Deepak Thapa’s successful leadership is one reason for Social Science Baha’s continuity and freshness. I do not have other information about people and institutions to present here. As it is linked to the Himal association, it has always benefited from Kanak Dixit’s leadership, research and contacts, among others. Martin Cahutari is another research institute and public forum that is open year-round. People use the Chautari for meetings, presentations and interactions. It has an excellent library where one can access research materials and a collection of books and journals with research relevance. Historian Pratyoush Onta’s dedication and scholarship, as well as the hard work of his cohort and their research, have kept the Chautari going. The Linguistic Society of Nepal organises internationally popular annual conferences. It sometimes works in tandem with the Central Department of Linguistics, too. The Literary Association of Nepal is another organisation that holds seminars annually. As chairman of both of these associations in the past, I can write other articles about the struggle to create a forum for such organisations. It was not easy to work at a time when the political system of the country was not democratic. The broader international participation and the free expression of opinions were particularly in focus. But we continued the work. Today, I feel happy that our erstwhile students, who have become academics, run these organisations. I remember making some short presentations at Baha in the past. This year, I was invited to discuss at a session \"Of Journeys and Worldviews: Formation of Early Modern Consciousness in Nepal\". Three Central Department of English academics, Shiva Rijal, Mahesh Paudyal and Komal Phuyal, made different presentations on the above theme. The courses in the department are interdisciplinary. They chose Nepali fictional and dramatic texts that address the times when travelling on foot was a common practice.According to these scholars, the well-known Nepali literary texts that depict this condition give a picture of a feudal society where people's physical mobility coheres with the level of consciousness and characters’ aspirations. Through their analyses of the texts, they discussed a condition of power and discipline; they evoked the theories of New Historicism and the power and knowledge of the French theorist Michel Foucault. My comments were woven around these themes. Rijal gave a picture of a society where an individual’s journeys, confusions and quests get dramatised in the plays. Travelling on foot sets the stage. He addressed the tension between the wide space of travel and its representation on small impromptu stages. The staging of Mukunda Indira (1939) and Sahanshila Sushila (1940) at Durbar High School and the newly opened Judhyodaya Public School, respectively, shows that theatrical reality. The text Mukunda Indira is set along the route to India, whereas Sahanshila Sushila is set in Kathmandu and Nuwakot. Rijal's theory is that ''Reading Nepal’s walking era through modern plays is not a literary experience alone.'' It opens up more.Phuyal chose early fictional texts like Lil Bahadur Chhetri’s Basain (1957) and Lain Sing Bangdel’s Muluk Bahira (1948). He claimed these fictional works show the \"formation of the political self of the society.\" He sees through these novels the Nepali state making efforts to what he calls \"to intellectually and politically awake itself from the grip of traditional lynchpins.\" Paudyal’s choice of what he rightly calls \"seven representative Nepali short stories\" written in pre-modern Nepali times represent the long forties of the 20th century. As the engine-propelled means of transport had not become accessible, especially to the common people wanting to move, travelling became solely a bodily performance. He shows how, in the stories, this factor becomes a reality.In my observation, I put that some questions may be addressed while discussing the form of travel then. The accessibility of the rails in India for the Nepalis to travel extended the reality of what the paper writers rightly called pre-modern travel on foot. Through human contact, migration to places like Assam, Burma and other areas of British India became possible. However, the three paper presenters rightly evoked the conditionality of power and social mobility by using the mode of travel by foot. Using fictional characters, the paper writers gave their theory new power and explained the phenomenon of a consonance of life, reality and imagination. They had selected fiction and drama, which alone could capture that reality by bringing society, creativity and forward-looking dynamism into play. That dynamism is different from any anthropological or social study. A cohort of research-savvy audience, including Onta, discussed the subject introduced by the three scholars. I appreciate the modality of the existing conferences. This particular conference was different and effective. I returned with a good experience that evening.      \nThe prime minister and several ministers keep on asking: Since the quota reform has already been implemented, why are the students still demonstrating? The repetition of this question only proves how blind to facts and disconnected with the people the government and Awami League leaders are. They are denying or seem to be oblivious to the fact that over 200 killed—the government itself admits to 150—and thousands injured by the indiscriminate firing by the police and Border Guard Bangladesh (BGB) has totally changed the situation. In one eye hospital in Dhaka, during the violence, nearly 400 people who sustained eye injuries were treated, 300 of whom had to be admitted, and 250 had to undergo eye surgery. The majority of them had pellet (a particular type of ammunition used by police during the recent violence) wounds in one or both eyes. Imagine what the total figure could be like. We have no count yet of how many will have to amputate one or both arms or legs due to gunshots, and how many more will have to be operated upon. How many will really return to normal life? Everything points to mindless violence that cannot be termed as police action to quell unrest that emanates from usual demonstrations in our part of the world. The evidence is of a mindset of \"shoot at sight,\" as announced by an AL leader.Today's issue is seeking justice. Justice for the massacre of students and other citizens, the unleashing of a killing machine that the police and BGB turned out to be, the large-scale arrests, the \"block raids,\" the house-to-house search, the false cases, and the insults of terming the demonstrators in general to be agents of destruction and anti-Bangladesh forces.The all-encompassing issue that has alienated the students and enraged the people is the atmosphere of fear under which all students, youth, politically involved citizens, and people in general are having to live. (A father called this author and said, \"I have a school-going son. I become tense with every sound of a car stopping near my house at night\".) The killings definitely stand as the most brutal retaliation by a government on any civic movement in the post-liberation Bangladesh history—and may be that of the subcontinent. We shudder at the thought of how a civilian government could allow its law enforcers to attack its own people with such brutality. The killing was not just an event, but one that took place over several days. Wasn't there any reflection, any afterthought and reassessment at the end of the first, second or third day that such heartless and continuous killing of one's own people must stop?What brought the party that led us during the Liberation War to this? Over 15 years of unaccountable power, greed, cronyism, wealth accumulation, abuse of authority, and the attitude that they are above the law.Of all the deaths, the most heart-rending is perhaps the story of Riya Gope, a six-year-old in Nayamati, Narayanganj, who was playing on the rooftop of their four-storey building. On July 19 afternoon, when police started firing on the demonstrators on the street near her house, her father Dipak Kumar Gope rushed to the roof to get her; he was carrying his daughter back to their flat when a bullet struck the child's head. She died at the Dhaka Medical College Hospital (DMCH) on July 25. How could a bullet hit someone on the roof of a four-storey building unless the police took an aim to do so? Was Riya a threat? The explanation will most likely be that it was an accident. But can that be acceptable when she was in her father's arms on the roof of a four-storey building?Use of helicopters to fire sound grenades and tear gas shells is a new element we saw in crowd-handling by the law enforcers this time around. However, there are disturbing accounts from the public, reporters and especially photographers that rifle shots were fired from these helicopters upon demonstrating crowds. On July 18 and 19, around mid-morning, helicopters hovered over Mayor Hanif Flyover, Shanir Akhra, Kajla and Signboard areas, sometimes sweeping down as they flew and fired on the crowd gathered below. These helicopters were clearly marked with the insignia of our law enforcers.The case of Sumaiya Akter in Narayanganj adds credibility to this claim. She was 20 years old and the mother of a healthy two-month-old daughter. Hearing the sound of the helicopter and that of the clashes going on outside, following her mother, Sumaiya ventured out to the veranda of her sixth floor apartment to see what was going on. She got hit by a live bullet and died soon after. Where could the bullet come from? Given the height and the location of the apartment, the most likely possibility is that the shot came from a helicopter, as claimed by her family. This gives substance to claims by many others that they saw gunshots coming from helicopters.How can a protesting crowd be fired upon from the air by their own government? Firing from helicopters is known to occur only when operating in an \"enemy\" territory or a location captured by armed terrorists. How can our own BGB or Rab or police fire upon our own people in such a manner?We demand a credible and thorough investigation on the use of helicopters and their firing on demonstrators. While the judicial investigation to probe all deaths should continue, a separate and fast-track probe must be conducted to reveal the truth on this specific matter.It must also be investigated as to what led to such a large-scale killing in the hands of law enforcers. Who made the threat assessment, and how? At what stage were they allowed to open fire on demonstrators, and who gave the orders to shoot? The rifles used were all modern and sophisticated. BGB used weapons meant to protect our borders. How could they be allowed to tackle student demonstrators with the same weapons? The investigation should also consider whether or not excessive force and disproportionate firepower were used against the demonstrators, none of whom have so far been seen to carry firearms. They were all carrying sticks and iron rods.It is our considered view that the government and the ruling party continue to live in their own bubble and underestimate the depth of the people's grievances that has resulted from the killings of students and the public. We also feel that peace will not return to the campuses and the streets until justice is done and convincingly seen to be done. Force can be used to \"calm\" the situation, but it will be temporary. The lengthier the period of uncertainty, the more grievous will be its impact on our economy and the country's international acceptability.Those who are used to using power to get their way are usually not aware of its limits. We have used Ansar, police, Rab, BGB and even the army, and an extreme measure like curfew. What has been the result? Yes, brutality, death, arrests and harassment can be further ratcheted up. But all that will generate more resentment, deeper hatred, and critical desperation. Such use of force may, at best, show a superficial show of calm, but will never solve our real problem of \"power corrupting and absolute power corrupting absolutely\" (adopting Lord Acton's time-honoured observation).We urge the government to no longer hide behind convenient narratives that stand totally contradicted by facts. We further urge them to examine the brutality with which the demonstrators have been treated and the death and injuries that ordinary students and the people have had to suffer, and respond to the call for justice. We also urge them to stop befooling themselves as facts are in people's hands due to modern technology. Yes, there could be a lot of false news and videos in the digital sphere. But there are many credible ones too. Wisdom should compel the government not to brush them aside, which it will do only at its own peril.-The Daily Star (Bangladesh)/ANN \nKamal Bahadur Shah, the newly appointed chief minister of Sudurpaschim Province, took his oath of office and secrecy before Province Head Najir Miya on Monday.After swearing-in, the chief minister appointed six ministers and three ministers of state, forming a 10-member council of ministers. The ministers and state ministers were also sworn in later on the day.Unlike before, the formation of the Council of Ministers did not face challenges as the issue of power-sharing between the coalition partners was immediately resolved. Chief Minister Shah successfully managed to allocate portfolios to the ministers and ministers of state.Nepali Congress, CPN-UML, and Nagarik Unmukti Party formed the present ruling coalition in Sudurpaschim.As part of power-sharing in the provincial government, Nepali Congress got three ministerial portfolios along with two ministers of state, including the chief minister whereas the CPN-UML got three ministerial portfolios and one state minister. The Nagarik Unmukti party is given one ministry in the Cabinet.From Nepali Congress, Bahadur Singh Thapa has been assigned to the finance ministry and Meghraj Khadka to the social development ministry. Prakash Bahadur Bam and Saraswati Khadka have become state ministers at the ministry of finance and the ministry of social development respectively.Likewise, Surendra Bahadur Pal became the minister for physical infrastructure, Bir Bahadur Thapa the minister for land management, agriculture, and cooperatives, and Hira Sarki the minister for internal affairs and law representing the UML in the cabinet. Nirmala Saud has been made the state minister for the ministry for physical infrastructure development.Laxman Kishor Chaudhary, representing the Nagarik Unmukti Party, has been appointed as the minister for industry, tourism, forest, and environment.This is Shah's second term as the chief minister. He had earlier headed the provincial government for 14 months from February 9, 2023, to April 4 this year. \nBangladesh’s former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina landed in India’s northeastern city of Agartala on Monday after fleeing Dhaka, broadcaster CNN-News18 reported. India is set to offer a safe passage to Hasina, the report said, citing intelligence sources. Army chief General Waker-Us-Zaman said in a televised address that Hasina 76, had left the country and that an interim government would be formed.Media reports said she had flown in a military helicopter with her sister.Television visuals showed thousands of people pouring into the streets of the capital Dhaka in jubilation and shouting slogans.Thousands also stormed Hasina’s official residence ‘Ganabhaban’, shouting slogans, pumping fists and showing victory signs.Television visuals showed crowds in the drawing rooms of the residence, and some people could be seen carrying away televisions, chairs and tables from what was one of the most protected buildings in the country.“She has fled the country, fled the country,” some shouted. Protesters in Dhaka also climbed atop a large statue of independence leader Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, Hasina’s father, and began chiselling away at the head with an axe, the visuals showed.Student activists had called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Hasina to resign, a day after deadly clashes across the country killed nearly 100 people.About 150 people were killed in protests last month.On Monday, at least six people were killed in clashes between police and protesters in the Jatrabari and Dhaka Medical College areas on Monday, the Daily Star newspaper reported. Reuters could not immediately verify the report.Bangladesh has been engulfed by protests and violence that began last month after student groups demanded the scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs.That escalated into a campaign to seek the ouster of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition. \nProtesting students in Bangladesh have called for a march to the capital Dhaka on Monday in defiance of a nationwide curfew to press Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign, a day after deadly clashes in the South Asian country killed nearly 100 people.Bangladesh has been engulfed by protests and violence that began last month after student groups demanded scrapping of a controversial quota system in government jobs. That escalated into a campaign to seek the ouster of Hasina, who won a fourth straight term in January in an election boycotted by the opposition.At least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured on Sunday in a wave of violence across the country of 170 million people as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters. Starting Sunday evening, a nationwide curfew has been imposed, the railways have suspended services and the country’s huge garments industry has closed.Sunday’s death toll, which included at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh’s recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets against the quotas.The government declared the indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday and also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.“The government has killed many students. The time has come for the final answer,” protest coordinator Asif Mahmud said in a statement on Facebook late on Sunday. “Everyone will come to Dhaka especially from the surrounding districts. Come to Dhaka and take a position on the streets.”The Bangladesh army urged everyone to obey the curfew rules.“The Bangladesh army will perform its promised duty in line with the Bangladesh constitution and existing laws of the country,” it said in a statement late on Sunday.“In this regard the people are requested to abide by the curfew as well as give full cooperation to this end,” it said, adding that the curfew was imposed to ensure the security of people’s lives, properties and important state establishments.Over the weekend, there have been attacks, vandalism and arson targeting government buildings, offices of the ruling Awami League party, police stations and houses of public representatives, local media reported. Violence was reported in 39 of the country’s 64 districts.Army role in focusBangladesh Railway said it had suspended all services indefinitely due to the escalating violence.Garment factories in the country, which supply apparel to some of the top brands in the world, have also been closed indefinitely.“In view of the prevailing situation, owners have decided to close all garment factories across the country, considering the overall safety of the workers,” the Bangladesh Garment Manufacturers and Exporters Association said.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasina’s biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.For the second time during the recent protests, the government has shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed and Hasina’s resignation.Hasina has said that “those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation”.The role of the country’s army in tackling the violence has come into focus with a group of retired military officers urging Hasina to withdraw troops from the streets and undertake “political initiatives” to resolve the crisis.Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman has said the army will always be there for the people’s interests and for any needs of the state. He is due to brief the media on Monday. \nToday, Nepal is expected to experience partly to generally cloudy conditions. Light to moderate rain, accompanied by thunder and lightning, is likely across all provinces, with a chance of heavy rainfall in one or two locations in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.Tonight, cloudy conditions will persist throughout the country. Light to moderate rain, with thunder and lightning, is anticipated in many areas of Koshi, Madhesh, Bagmati, Gandaki, and Lumbini provinces, and in some parts of the remaining regions.Heavy rainfall is possible in a few places in Koshi, Madhesh, and Bagmati provinces, and at one or two locations in Gandaki and Lumbini provinces. There is also a risk of very heavy rainfall at one or two places in Koshi and Bagmati provinces.On Sunday, the highest recorded temperature was 35.2 degrees Celsius in Dipayal and Dhangadhi, while the lowest recorded temperature was 14.5 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.  \nIn 2008 Matina Shakya was only three years old when she was appointed as the Kumari of Kathmandu. She was succeeded by Trishna Shakya as the new Kumari in 2017.Kumaris are revered as goddesses of beauty and strength in certain Hindu and Buddhist traditions. Worshipping young girls as Kumaris is a 2,000-year-old practice in Nepal. Since the 13th century, when the Malla kings ruled, the Newars of the Kathmandu Valley have been worshipping Kumari, a girl from the Shakya/Bajracharya community chosen to embody the divine energy of goddess Taleju Bhawani. The reign of a Kumari ends when she starts menstruating. So long as she is serving as the Kumari, she is believed to be the nation’s divine protector, safeguarding it from evil. Matina, 18, is now in her first year of college, studying for a bachelor’s degree in management. Her father, Pratapman Shakya, when asked about having a daughter who is the only living the goddess in the world said, “Not having your own daughter live in the same house as you seemed a little unfair, but we feel very proud to call ourselves the parents of the royal Kumari who is revered by people all over the world.”On March 9, 2023, he, along with Matina, were getting ready for a special function held to honour all former Kumaris from across Nepal. “There are often events to honour Matina as she was the royal Kumari, but this one was dedicated to all former Kumaris from different areas. There are 129 living Kumaris in all,” he added. Besides Kathmandu, Kumari tradition is followed in Bhaktapur, Lalitpur, and Kirtipur, among other cities.According to him, this was the first time an event like this was organised and the Deputy Mayor of Kathmandu, Sunita Dangol, was also in attendance.Throughout the year, many people line up outside the ‘Kumari Ghar’ to get a chance to visit the Kumari and get her blessings. Many foreigners stand out in the yard to catch a glimpse of her. Nepali people believe that if a Kumari smiles at you, it is a bad omen.Everyday, a tutor visits the Kumari to help her continue with her education as she is not allowed to step outside the Kumari Ghar. She takes her exams and does her homework from the Kumari Ghar itself. She also has the freedom to play inside the Kumari Ghar. Many former kumaris have pursued careers in their fields of interest or studied after their term ends, and they continue to be treated with the same respect. The tradition of Kumari has evolved over time. In the past Kumaris did not enjoy these freedoms.Because of various superstitious beliefs, Kumaris were not fully educated and were forbidden from getting married because of the belief that the groom would die soon if he married an ex-Kumari. They led secluded lives, were restricted from participating in normal childhood activities, and focused solely on their religious duties.However, now, these myths have been dispelled. Modern understanding has shifted to recognise that Kumaris, after stepping down from their divine role, have the freedom to marry and lead a normal life. The perception of Kumaris as isolated figures has evolved, with a focus on providing them with a more balanced upbringing. There have been initiatives to integrate Kumaris into regular social and educational settings, allowing them to have a more holistic and fulfilling childhood experience. “Matina was already familiar with the students from the school that she attended after her term as Kumari ended,” said Shakya. “The kids visited the Kumari Ghar frequently so that she could have a smooth transition,” he added. According to Gautam Prasad Shakya, who has been living as a caretaker in the Kumari Ghar, the changes made to the tradition are minor. “The traditions of Kumari have mostly stayed the same. All the rituals are still practised like in the old days,” he said.On 6 May 2005, Pun Devi Maharjan, a lawyer, filed a case in the Supreme Court claiming that the traditional practice of electing young girls as Kumaris, or “goddesses’, who are expected to follow certain social restrictions and appear at religious festivals, violated the rights of the child. Quoting Maharjan’s complaint, Puskar Mathema writes in Yuwamanch Monthly of October 2007, “If Kumari tradition is continued, it will undermine the fundamental rights as well the freedoms of children guaranteed by the constitution and child rights treaties. Apart from this, it will have a negative impact on their physical and mental development.”The case continued while Nepal overthrew the monarchy and declared itself a secular state in 2007. When the judgement was pronounced in 2008, the goddess was still in her role, now giving blessings to the country’s President. The court ordered that the Kumaris and ex-Kumaris receive better benefits and arrangements and ordered the government to improve their support and allowances.In April 2006, Prof Chunda Bajracharya filed a petition at the Supreme Court against Maharjan’s petition, who had argued against the Kumari tradition. Bajracharya contended that the tradition should be preserved as heritage due to its over 100 years of history.“People who don’t understand the culture shouldn’t comment on it,” she stated. Bajracharya also criticised the human right activists who contended that Kumaris were only allowed to wear the colour red. “People who say Kumaris are forced to wear red clothing all the time, are the same people who send their kids to schools in uniform,” she said.“After the 2008 court verdict, there have been a lot of improvements. Now, a teacher visits the Kumari Ghar daily to tutor the Kumari, who is expected to complete school assignments and sit periodic exams. All the former Kumaris now get benefits like scholarships and special pensions,” she added.Bajracharya is currently a professor of literature at the Tribhuvan University in Kathmandu.“The only significant change that the court verdict brought to the tradition was in terms of her education,” said Gautam Prasad Shakya, the caretaker. “Kumaris were tutored long before the case, but the case helped formalise this arrangement. After the court verdict, the time between 12 pm and 4 pm was designated as the Kumari’s tuition time,” he added.After the verdict, there was a concerted effort to provide Kumaris with access to quality education, enabling them to develop the skills and knowledge needed to lead fulfilling lives beyond their divine roles. There was also a shift towards ensuring that the Kumari's living quarters are comfortable, safe, and conducive to her overall well-being.Moreover, the selection process for the Kumari underwent reforms in the aftermath of the Pun Devi Maharjan case. There was a push for greater transparency, accountability, and inclusivity in the selection of the Kumari, with an emphasis on ensuring that the process was fair, respectful, and free from undue influence.Efforts were made to support their transition into adulthood, including providing them with comprehensive resources for education, vocation, and social integration. This shift aimed to address the challenges faced by former Kumaris and empower them to lead independent and fulfilling lives after their divine service.“The Kumari tradition has evolved over time. During the tenure of my daughter, we saw a lot of improvements. Even after her time as Kumari, Matina continued to get a lot of government support,” said Shakya, former Kumari Matina’s father.“Some people argue that child rights are being violated, but all of her rights are being upheld inside the Kumari Ghar. This is a unique and respected aspect of Nepali culture, and I don’t believe it violates any of my child’s rights.”While the Kumari tradition continues, its practices have evolved. “She enjoys this normal life and it didn’t take her long to adjust as well,” says Matina’s father, on her transition from the revered Kumari to the ordinary Matina. \nMost economists believe spending on infrastructure has a significant multiplier effect. During the construction phase, infrastructure generates real cash flow for workers and their families. In the long run, it has a direct and indirect impact on the economy, with a multiplier effect, particularly in job creation.In Rupandehi, which hosts the industrial city Bhairahawa, and Lumbini, a landmark of the Buddhist world listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1997, infrastructure built with a sizeable investment has gone to waste.Big infrastructure projects like the international convention centre, meditation centre, industrial zones, and Gautam Buddha International Airport have failed to generate income and have turned into veritable white elephants.Nature has started reclaiming most of the under-utilised infrastructure.Since 2010, talk of building an international airport led to the construction of large-scale infrastructure, including a bevy of luxury hotels.Proliferating factories and a rapidly spreading transport network turned the Butwal-Bhairahawa metroplex into an economic powerhouse.Nepal opened its second international airport in May 2022 in the southern city of Bhairahawa, but no international flight stops there right now.The objective of building an international airport in Bhairahawa was to bring in more tourists, energise businesses and create jobs. But the situation is just the opposite. Traders are closing down their shops and moving abroad for decent jobs.The private sector, too, invested heavily. When the finished project started to sit idle, it hit the sector, and many enterprises were teetering into bankruptcy.Economists term this development in Lumbini a cascading failure—a breakdown in a system of interconnected parts in which the failure of one or few parts leads to the failure of other parts. Hem Raj Regmi, deputy chief statistician and data curator at the National Statistics Office, said Lumbini province saw heavy investment from the government and the private sector, but the output has slowed. “Enterprises are unable to raise even the operating cost.”In the last fiscal year, Lumbini province was estimated to grow at 4.05 percent to a GDP of Rs814 billion, from the low base of the 1.99 percent growth it had achieved in the previous fiscal year. Lumbini is estimated to contribute 14.26 percent to the national GDP. The highest value-added growth rate in Lumbini was in electricity and gas, which grew by 28.93 percent, while the manufacturing sector was estimated to shrink by a negative 1.43 percent in the last fiscal year.Most completed infrastructures in Lumbini have become white elephants, as their expenditures have been growing instead of them generating income. The Butwal International Convention Center, built with an investment of Rs1.11 billion in ward 10 of Butwal Sub Metropolis, is currently without business. The centre has 13 halls, each with a capacity to accommodate 2,700 people. The auditorium is the largest of the 13.The government built the convention centre to organise national and international conferences and events, but it is not generating much income. Construction started in 2014 and the centre was inaugurated in August 2022.Officials say that the centre is struggling to pay its staff. While the centre is under-utilised and lacks maintenance, bushes have grown around it.Dharmendra Panthi, chief of the Butwal International Convention Center project, said 22 events or functions have been conducted in the past three years, earning Rs4 million. The centre is currently closed as the provincial cabinet is yet to pass the operating guidelines even in three years.However, Panthi said they have been occasionally renting the hall on request. The centre charges Rs96,000 for a day-long event.Prabin Pathak, president of the Nepal Hoteliers Association, who took part in a recent function at the convention centre, said the infrastructure is in a sorry state due to lack of periodic maintenance.“If the building is not utilised properly, it will be a waste of tax money,” said Pathak. “The washroom faucets are dry, and it is difficult to sit in the hall due to the stench from the washroom.”“In Nepal, there is a growing trend of building new infrastructure, but their upkeep is often ignored. This is sad,” Pathak said. “No one is accountable for the losses the projects incur. Similarly, questions are raised about the quality of construction. In most projects, low-quality materials are used, severely compromising the structural integrity.”A hall with a capacity to accommodate 5,000 people built near the Buddha’s birthplace, Lumbini, has yet to do any business, except hosting a few functions. It was built with an investment of Rs720 million.Sanuraja Shakya, member-secretary of the Lumbini Development Trust, said that if a social organisation wants to conduct a function at the centre, they have to pay a fee.Shakya said that since it is a meditation centre, they do not allow other functions, especially those involving entertainment.Questions were raised about the construction when the roof started leaking soon after project’s completion. It was repaired later.Likewise, the Special Economic Zone (SEZ) in Bhairahawa, has not been fully operational for a long time. As factories have not been set up in the SEZ, the area has turned into a jungle. Construction of the SEZ had started in 2003 and it was inaugurated in 2014.Located in south-central Nepal, the Bhairahawa Special Economic Zone has 69 industrial plots of sizes from 1,400 to 3,700 square metres. A few industrialists have booked plots, but have not set up their plants as the government has failed to provide pledged services and amenities. The government had promised to provide 24-hour electricity, a one-stop service system, customs, banks, and insurance among other things inside the SEZ.“Every year, new entrepreneurs book plots, but do not set up their factories due to associated tough conditions,” said Saput Dumre, assistant director of SEZ. Dumre said industrialists are concerned about the mandatory export provision. According to SEZ guidelines, which were amended three months ago, firms that lease space inside the SEZ must export at least 30 percent of manufactured goods. “There is a water tank in the SEZ, but it has no water, the weighing machine does not work, the petrol pump is defunct, there are no parking areas, and the road is covered in thick bushes,” said Ujjwal Prasad Kasaju, a central member of the Federation of Nepalese Chambers of Commerce and Industry. Then there is the new Gautam Buddha International Airport—all dressed up, and nowhere to go. The airport awaits applications for flight slots from international airlines after more than two years of opening.Nepal's second international airport was ready after ten years and nearly Rs40 billion pumped into the project, but despite the build-up, the expected rush of eager carriers is nowhere to be seen.The airport is a landmark located in south central Nepal and spread over 787 bighas (533 hectares).The modern facility has a 15,169-square-metre terminal building that can serve nearly a million passengers a year. The airport's 3,000-metre runway is long enough to handle the largest commercial jets. However, no commercial jet wants to fly to the airport. \nIn Kathmandu, where construction dust often clouds the air, the resumption of the pavement widening project at New Road on July 17 has elicited mixed reactions. While some citizens harbour doubts and disagreements, people with disabilities have their fingers crossed as well. For Narayani Dawadi, who is visually impaired, the initiative offers hope and apprehension in equal measures. She worries that the Kathmandu Metropolitan City (KMC) might overlook the parameters for disabled-friendly infrastructure and execute the project superficially.Dawadi’s scepticism is not unwarranted. Her distrust stems from her 20 years of experience navigating Kathmandu, where she has become familiar with its footpaths and pavements. Despite this familiarity, she cannot navigate confidently due to the ever-changing, unpredictable condition of the pavements.“I don’t know if I can call the footpaths accessible,” Dawadi says. “There is tactile paving for white cane users but it’s not perfect. Sometimes they guide us to a pole or a tree, and in many places, there are only partial tactile guides, leaving us confused.”Her experience highlights a recurring issue: lack of a reliable, consistent infrastructure for people with disabilities in Kathmandu.The roads and footpaths that appear fine during the day are often damaged or under-construction by the evening, giving people with disabilities a hard time navigating them.Dawadi isn’t entirely critical; she appreciates the KMC’s sidewalk widening projects and regulations on street vending and parking. Areas like Baneshwar have become much easier to navigate, Dawadi says.However, Dawadi hopes the KMC doesn’t just displace street vendors without providing alternatives. “They need options that won’t affect their income; a crackdown won’t work.”Dawadi emphasises that KMC shouldn’t view current projects as a complete solution to make public infrastructure ‘disabled-friendly.’ Issues like half-finished tactile paving, narrow roads, and misplaced poles and tiles need to be addressed. “People with disabilities should be involved in planning,” she says.Rishi Dhakal, 44, a wheelchair user for the past 21 years and president of the Spinal Cord Injury Network Nepal, says that while the KMC has been building new footpaths and pavements with nice bricks and tiles, they often fail to meet the measurements for wheelchair use.Rishi notes that the footpath in Narayantar, between Bagmati Bridge to Jorpati Chowk, has become easier for pedestrians and the visually impaired due to reduced parking and fewer street vendors. But it remains inaccessible for wheelchair users due to a lack of proper slopes.“On many footpaths, especially at crossroads, the slope is not favourable for wheelchairs to climb,” he explains. “The footpath has become just a showpiece.”Rishi and his organisation are working to arrange a meeting with the minister and secretary of the Ministry of Physical Infrastructure and Transport to present a memorandum advocating for wheelchair-friendly slopes on Kathmandu’s footpaths. On July 21, Rishi met with the ministry’s Joint Secretary Sushil Babu Dhakal to discuss the next steps.While Rishi appreciates the ongoing work to widen pavements on New Road, he doubts the standard measurements for slopes and inclined planes for wheelchair users will be adhered to, citing KMC’s recent work on footpaths near Tribhuvan International Airport where the slopes are inaccessible.Another wheelchair user, Muskan Adhikari, pointed to a double problem of inaccessibility: footpaths lack slopes, and the sky bridges are not wheelchair-friendly. Moreover, she has faced incidents where vehicles did not stop at crossings when traffic police were absent, leading to several close calls.Rishi’s organisation has also received reports of incidents of wheelchair users being hit by vehicles in the Jorpati area.“The constitution promises accessible infrastructure for people with disabilities to navigate independently, but the current footpaths and infrastructure makes independent travel very difficult,” Adhikari said. “Forget pavements, even government offices are not accessible.”Rishi says that even the Health Ministry is only accessible up to the first floor, “forcing us to wait all day for meetings as ministers do not sit on the first floor.” This lack of accessibility extends to the KMC office itself, which has a metal ramp that is extremely difficult for wheelchair users to use and there is no tactile paving either.Vishwo Shrestha, director at the Blind Youth Association Nepal, reveals that their organisation frequently receives reports of blind and visually impaired individuals falling into sewers and rivers due to inadequate safety measures. In Sukedhara, where several offices catering to the blind community are located, a lack of proper fences along Dhobikhola river had previously resulted in accidents. The association had petitioned the KMC a year and a half ago for guard rails or road safety barriers.“Despite the installation of guard rails, there have been recent cases of individuals falling into the river due to gaps in the barriers,” Shrestha says. Shrestha adds that while not all incidents are reported, they receive two to three cases every two months involving falls into rivers or sewers. Many incidents involving collisions with poles or trees due to poor tactile guidance or uneven footpaths go unreported. “This reflects a major failure of the state’s duty,” he said.Meanwhile, for 36-year-old Radha Kumal, a blind white cane user, problems in footpaths and pavements are just part of the larger problems in the country’s road infrastructure. “We don’t know where the zebra cross begins, and traffic lights are useless for us as we cannot see the colour change,” she says. Many like Kumal hope for audio signals at traffic lights to ensure safe and independent road crossings.Sukhdev Ray, 41, who is deaf and lives in Baneshwar, points out a different but equally critical issue: lack of proper signage. “Without clear directional signs in public spaces like pavements, it’s hard for us to find our destinations,” Ray says. “As I can’t hear, I rely on signs for guidance.”Ray also adds that many traffic lights either malfunction or are ignored by drivers. “Crossing the road can be chaotic,” he notes. “With drivers in a rush and traffic lights often disregarded, I often fear getting hit, like I was the last time.”Ray was hit by a motorcycle while walking at Satdobato four months ago. Though he didn’t suffer major injuries, he is still reminded of the incident while walking on the road. He was also hit by a Safa tempo twice in Bhaisepati in June.Sugam Bhattarai, general secretary of the National Federation of the Disabled Nepal (NFDN), acknowledges that the KMC’s new footpaths and railings are a step forward but “they are usually limited to major areas like New Road and lack comprehensive accessibility features.”According to Bhattarai, in Nepal, the term ‘disabled-friendly’ often translates to just adding tactile paving and a ramp, ticking off an ‘inclusivity checklist’ without genuinely addressing accessibility needs. “What about individuals with deafness or intellectual disabilities?” he questions. The Act Relating to Rights of Persons with Disabilities, 2017, and the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (UNCRPD), which Nepal has ratified, mandate accessibility to infrastructure.Article 9 of the UNCRPD says, “States Parties shall take appropriate measures to ensure to persons with disabilities access to the physical environment, transportation, information and communications, and other facilities and services open or provided to the public, both in urban and in rural areas.”Despite these legal frameworks, implementation remains inconsistent.Kumal shared that the ongoing pavement widening project at New Road has uprooted both sides of the road, leaving no alternative paths or assistance for the blind. “There’s no guidance or facilities for us,” she said.Shrestha criticises the KMC’s approach for lacking provisions for the blind and visually impaired. “Construction continues without first ensuring alternative routes or proper information,” he said.Nabin Manandhar, spokesperson for the KMC, assures that their pavement widening project at New Road includes considerations for disability access. “While we’re committed to making footpaths accessible, we’re not yet at the stage where we can address all types of disabilities,” he said.“We’ve just started. We welcome suggestions and acknowledge that we can’t address every issue alone.”Baburam Bhattarai, an expert member at the City Planning Commission under the KMC, emphasised that new projects adhere to disability guidelines. “We are monitoring compliance and plan to address issues with old pavements, including complaints about obstructing electric poles,” he said.However, officials blame funding constraints as a barrier in implementing good ideas.In 2021, the Department of Roads allocated Rs50 million for disabled-friendly pavements. The first phase (1.5km from Putalisadak to Thapathali) was completed, but the second phase at Durbarmarg and Jamal was halted due to budget constraints, according to Narayan Dutta Bhandari, division chief of the Road Division of Kathmandu.Rishi said that they, along with the NFDN, will start monitoring construction across the capital. If the right parameters are not followed, they will negotiate with the KMC, even if it means halting the work, he said.“We’ve learned to navigate the inconveniences in Kathmandu’s pavements and roads, but that doesn’t mean they’re not problematic,” Kumal says. “Accessible infrastructure is our right. While we do our best to adapt, we expect the government to adapt to our needs as well.” \nThe Monetary Policy for Fiscal Year 2024-25 issued last Friday by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB), the monetary authority of Nepal, is generally hailed as expansionary. Nepal’s stock market responded positively to it, triggering a bull run and circuit breaks on Sunday’s trade, the first day of trading after the policy announcement. The Nepal Stock Exchange Index crossed the 2,700 mark after 29 months.The market seemed to have responded positively to the abolition of the Rs200 million ceiling to institutional investors in margin-type lending by the bank and financial institutions, an extension of the loan repayment period for the construction businesses by the end of December 2024, and provision for uncollateralised loans to those going for foreign employment, among others. These, indeed, are more reactive than well-thought-out sustainable policy responses that are unlikely to deliver desirable impacts on containing the severe recessionary trends faced by the economy.Monetary policy-makingFor decades now, Nepal’s monetary policy formulation has been a ritual orchestration rather than a substantive assertion of legally empowered independence by the NRB. The first compromise on monetary policy independence emanated from the fact that the Nepali currency is strictly pegged with the Indian currency. Pragmatically, the pluses of this arrangement may outweigh the minuses for the Nepali economy, so policymakers are not even considering discontinuing it.First, according to the universally acclaimed monetary theory of the impossible trinity, “a country can’t have a fixed exchange rate, independent monetary policy, and free capital movement all at once”. This means that no monetary policy can be ‘independent’ as long as it is pegged with any other currency. But we continue to embrace this impossibility.Second, the central bank shoulders three distinct responsibilities: Controlling inflation, ensuring financial sector stability through supervision and regulation, and, for all practical purposes, functioning as the government's key development finance agency. This reality has often obviated the NRB from an undivided focus on the 'core' central banking functions of money supply, inflation targeting and aversion to systemic risk.Third, the monetary authority and the monetary policy it brings out are often burdened with undue expectations beyond their jurisdiction and capacity. For example, a monetary policy is expected to come out with stimulus packages to ‘rescue’ the economy reeling down the recession, which could be appropriately addressed only by a bold and creative fiscal policy. The monetary policy can only complement this endeavour by managing financial resources for the same.Fourth and the saddest of all, the central bank is exhausting all its autonomy and energy in utterly un-innovative ritualisation of the tasks it should have shed decades ago. For instance, the directed lending policies in the name of the priority sector, deprived sector or the schemes aimed at financial inclusion should no longer be part of monetary policy since they may give rise to a conflict of interests between the roles of a regulator and concessional development financer. The most striking ambiguity of the sort is manifested in the NRB dilemma in dealing with microfinance institutions.The missesThe Monetary Policy appeared as if the central bank was unaware of the current economic malaise and the sources of recalcitrant stagnation. One major sector where the banks have over-invested in the past and suffocated at present is real estate. Except for raising the credit limit from 50 to 70 percent of the valuation to the homeowners with a ‘proven tax file’, the policy has left the land and housing entrepreneurs completely at bay. With India reducing duties on gold imports by 9 percent, as announced in the country’s annual budget last week, the gold market in Nepal, for better or worse, is going to be impacted differently. It will have a bearing on both investment and foreign exchange reserves. The new monetary policy grossly overlooks this phenomenon.Despite repeating a decade-old idea of setting up a second-tier oversight institution to regulate the saving and credit cooperatives and streamlining the operations of the microfinance institutions, the policy has blatantly failed to reinvigorate the small-and-medium-enterprise (SME) ecosystem. At present, the SMEs of Nepal face a grave crisis of legal/official recognition that has, in turn, impeded their access to formal financing mechanisms.The Economic Census of Nepal 2018 has shown that out of 923,356 establishments, only 462,605, or 50.1 percent, are registered. The rest—49.9 percent—have no legal identity. These are important entities providing self-employment and livelihood support to a large population. However, they have hardly any scope to find sizable investments and scale up their operations to enable them to reap the benefits of economies of scale. Again, it must not be misconstrued that the central bank should be directly involved in financing these SMEs. However, as a policy-maker, it should make functional arrangements by engaging relevant stakeholders like the subnational governments to facilitate and recognise grassroots businesses. This reflects the glaring gap in the public policymaking mindset that devolved financial power under federal polity can help optimise implementation, including monetary policy.Flimsy approachSome haphazard and over-ambitious policies have only eroded the central bank’s credibility as the regulator. A provision not to blacklist the contractors deliberately issuing bank checks without adequate balance in their accounts is in direct contravention of the best universal practices in banking.The monetary policy proposes to support the government in achieving an economic growth rate of 6 percent, as proposed by the budget of the current fiscal year, through liquidity management and credit disbursement towards the productive sector. It projects the broad money supply to be at 12.0 percent and credit disbursement to the private sector to grow at 12.5 percent. This means an increase of about Rs660 billion from the current Rs5.3 trillion disbursements of loans.The target is clearly to invest about Rs700 billion worth of loanable funds now lying idle in the system. This is a huge ask considering that during 11 months of the last fiscal year, loans from banks to the private sector increased only by 5.1 percent.The policy also fails to address the risk of alarmingly increasing non-performing assets in the banking system, making the banks more hesitant to invest aggressively. Such policy orchestration does not support the wider agenda of overdue structural reform of the financial system.  \nWhen the Ranjitkar group was established, they discovered this forgotten dance and devoted two years to researching it.Now, they are reintroducing it during Indra Jatra by training the new generation in this traditional art form. \nHe is known for his nationalist legacy, marked by the amendment of Nepal's map to include territories like Kalapani, Lipulekh, and Limpiyadhura, and his strong stance against India, especially during and after the 2015 Nepal blockade.But how did he rise to become the country's powerful man? \nPyakuryal holds a Phd in Public Affairs from the University of Akron, US. In this interview, they discuss Nepal’s elusive political stability, the narratives governing Nepali politics, the role of patriarchy, and the trends in Nepali politics Pyakuryal will be closely following in the years ahead. \n\nWriter and journalist Ghanshyam Khadka has released a new book, ‘Ananda Samhita.’ Known for his novel ‘Nirvana’, Khadka discusses philosophical insights on attaining a joyful life in this latest publication.Khadka's book highlights the issue of human suffering, delving into its root causes and exploring methods to end it to achieve lasting happiness.A statement by the publisher Alchemy reads, “While everyone spends their lives searching for happiness, many end up facing the opposite outcomes, leading to the belief that suffering is the reality of life.” They added, “This book discusses how anyone can achieve happiness under any circumstances if pursued with the right approach.”Each chapter of the book presents a straightforward concept of happiness and a practical method for implementing it.'Aananda Samhita' delves into the philosophical foundations of joy, examining how spirituality, psychology, and daily life intersect. Khadka explores these areas by providing readers with an understanding of joy beyond superficial happiness.The book also analyses different perspectives on happiness, explaining overcoming small and large obstacles in everyday life. \nWhen the Supreme Court’s verdict in March 2021 dissolved the then Nepal Communist Party (NCP) and revived the CPN-UML and CPN (Maoist Centre), most of the leaders returned to their mother parties.A group of Maoist leaders, however, joined the UML. They included some key Maoist leaders such as Ram Bahadur Thapa, Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, Lekh Raj Bhatta, Prabhu Sah and Mani Thapa. Some central committee members and scores of other cadres from various lower committees followed them to join the UML, the bigger communist party among the two.The UML and the Maoist Centre jointly fought the general elections in 2017 and later merged to form the NCP in 2018. But the merger was challenged in court, accusing them of copying the name of a fringe communist party. The Supreme Court in 2021 invalidated the merger, reviving their original parties.While around 30 central level Maoist leaders had joined UML, only a few have succeeded to hold important positions in the UML.CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli on Thursday convened the party’s central secretariat meeting to divide work among the leaders as several of them have become ministers in federal and provincial governments. The same meeting relieved former Maoist leader Mani Thapa of all his positions and roles from the party citing his failure to fulfill the roles and responsibilities assigned by the organisation.Thapa, who was a standing committee member in the UML, however, had reportedly tendered his resignation around a year ago expressing his differences on various issues with the UML leadership.Former key maoist leaders Ram Bahadur Thapa and Lekh Raj Bhatta are now vice-chair and secretary in the UML, respectively. Former Maoist leader Top Bahadur Rayamajhi, who was elected UML secretary in 2022, is now suspended after he is accused in Bhutanese refugee scam. He is now in judicial custody as the case is sub-judice.Prabhu Sah, a prominent Maoist leader of Madhesh Province, quit the UML to form the Aam Janata Party.Lil Bahadur Thapa and Jwala Kumari Sah are politburo members in the UML.According to multiple UML leaders with Maoist background, Mani Thapa remained inactive in the party activities and he also remained inactive during the November 2022 election.A Maoist-turned-UML leader said that the former Maoist Centre leaders, who were given more importance at the time of NCP split and immediately after joining the UML, were gradually sidelined. “That was one of the reasons why Mani Thapa became inactive in party activities,” the leader told the Post requesting anonymity.At the time of the NCP split, UML chair Oli was in serious trouble as the then UML leaders Madhav Kumar Nepal, Jhalanath Khanal, backed by a powerful group of second-rung leaders, had challenged him in the party. At the time, Oli managed to stay in the leadership taking support of the former Maoist leaders.“Thapa was a standing committee member in the UML. I am not aware of what exactly he had expected in the party but he was unhappy,” another UML leader with Maoist background told the Post. “It was Thapa’s personal decision to stay away from party activities. It has nothing to do with the party’s work style.”The Post’s attempts to contact Thapa were unsuccessful.Among the leaders who left the Maoist Centre to join the UML, Ram Bahadur Thapa, Rayamajhi, and Bhatta had played crucial roles in leading the decade-long Maoist insurgency.Some UML leaders with Maoist backgrounds admitted that they get discouraged when the party leadership does not acknowledge the people’s war. At times, UML leaders including chair Oli express critical views against Maoists and their decade-long insurgency.“It is true that UML leadership, especially chair KP Sharma Oli, ruthlessly criticises people’s war, but it is also the fact that both the parties signed a 12-point agreement and agreed to work together for the betterment of the country in 2006,” a former Maoist, currently with the UML, told the Post.The leader said that UML is the suitable option for communists in the country as the Maoist Centre’s political prospects have drastically diminished in recent years. “Though some of their statements on the Maoist insurgency at times cause bitterness, UML is the safest place for us now,” he added.Niru Darlami, another Maoist-turned-UML leader, rubbished the claims that former Maoists were deprived of opportunities in the UML. Some Maoist leaders got a chance to become ministers after joining the UML, says a UML leader.Mani Thapa himself was never given a ministerial position as a Maoist Centre leader but soon after joining the UML, he got the opportunity to lead the Ministry of Water Supply under the KP Sharma Oli government.Similarly, Jwala Kumari Sah held ministerial berths more than three times after joining the UML.Giridharilal Naupane, another UML leader with Maoist background, claimed that the leaders’ former Maoist background was no longer an issue in the UML. “We former Maoist leaders have already been mixed in the UML like sugar in water,” he said. “If some former Maoist leader raises the question to UML, it is due to their misunderstanding.”Meanwhile, some leaders argue that the UML leadership didn’t support Rayamajhi when he got in trouble after being accused in the refugee scam. The party leader still considered Rayamajhi an outsider, they say.“If any UML leader other than Rayamajhi was indicted in the refugee scam, the UML would have made a lot of efforts to release him from custody,” a Maoist-turned-UML leader told the Post on condition of anonymity.However, Maoist-turned-UML leader Tanka Angbuhang, who claims to have met Rayamajhi recently in jail, claims that Rayamajhi himself does not feel the party has alienated him.“During our meeting, Rayamajhi did not show any displeasure to the party,” Aangbuhang told the Post. \nAs Nepal adopted the federal system while promulgating the constitution in 2015, the country’s governance was expected to be more effective with the centralised power being devolved to the seven provinces and local units.However, in practice, provincial leaders are too dependent on the top politicians at the centre when it comes to forming and running the sub-national governments.Though the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML have pledged political stability in the country, observers are not convinced as the two parties too are for rotating the government leadership after some time both at the centre as well as in the provinces.The country’s mixed electoral system has been giving fractured results, resulting in no single party being able to form the government, not only at the centre but also in the seven provinces. The result is that the parties must form coalitions to constitute national as well as subnational governments. Every change of ruling partners at the centre has immediate implications on the provincial level. This was not envisioned while drafting the constitution, according to experts.Before the federal system, the authority was centralised. Even though the country was divided into five development regions and 75 districts, they only served as administrative hubs and centres. The new constitution gives executive as well as legislative powers to the provincial governments. Also, the local governments have all executive, legislative and judicial powers exercised by an elected council.“The country’s federal structure was designed to devolve the central government’s rights to the provinces and local units. But, in practice, the centre has grabbed hold of the provinces’ rights, in the same manner as in the old political structure,” former lawmaker Radheshyam Adhikari of Nepali Congress, who was a member in the Constituent Assembly as well, told the Post. “This was not how the federal structure was envisioned while drafting the constitution.”Blaming the electoral system for the prolonged political instability, the Congress-UML coalition has now vowed to amend the constitution and electoral laws purportedly to ensure stability. However, Adhikari questions the rationale behind such an amendment.“If the political leadership allows provinces to exercise their rights without dictating their daily functions from the centre, the federal system will still work,” he adds. “But they are afraid to give up power that they have been exercising for years to the subnational governments.”The July 1 change in the central coalition caused immediate jolts at the provinces.As per the two-party agreement, the UML formed the government at the centre with the Congress rallying KP Sharma Oli of the second largest party.The two parties also reached an agreement to lead governments in three provinces each while they supported the Janamat Party to form the provincial government in Madhesh. As per the deal, the UML will lead governments in Koshi, Lumbini, and Karnali provinces in the first round while the Congress will take the reins in Bagmati, Gandaki and Sudurpaschim. Except in Sudurpaschim, the governments in the other five provinces have already been formed. Chief Minister of Sudurpaschim Province Dirgha Sodari of the CPN (Unified Socialist), which is now in the opposition coalition, resigned on Friday.This arrangement in the provinces will change again, with the handover in federal government leadership to the Nepali Congress after two years from the day Oli was appointed the prime minister. Prime Minister Oli, reading out the seven-point agreement from the rostrum of Parliament on July 21, said he will lead the federal government for two years, and hand over the mantle to Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba.With the change in leadership at the centre, coalitions in the provinces too are expected to realign. “Even so, there will not be the kind of instability we saw earlier,” says Congress Chief Whip Shyam Kumar Ghimire.With the change of power equations at the centre, the whole dynamics of provincial politics changed, he said. For instance, in under two years, the Koshi government changed five times. “Though the provincial governments’ leadership can change as per the two-party deal, the Congress or the UML will continue to lead, thus providing political stability.” There are already signs of discord in the Congress-UML alliance.Congress and UML leaders have already started disputing power sharing in Gandaki Province, where Congress is leading the government.UML provincial leaders have been warning Gandaki Chief Minister Surendra Pandey of the Congress not to take long-term decisions as they expressed reservations over some of his moves. While forming the two-party coalition, the leaders said they wanted to ensure political stability, among other things. But political observers aren’t very optimistic. “The agreement between the two major parties says the leadership of the provincial governments will be rotated within an agreed timeframe. This will only lead to more instability,” Pitambar Bhandari, a political observer, told the Post. “The way our political parties are trying to run the federal structure, there could soon be a systemic crisis.” \nThe CPN (Unified Socialist) on Friday announced the names of 344 central committee members.The party, which picked 93 central members through its general convention held in July's first week, announced the names of the remaining 251 members on Friday.A task force comprising Chairman Madhav Kumar Nepal, senior leader Jhala Nath Khanal and General Secretary Ghanashyam Bhusal finalised the names of the central members.The party’s tenth general convention concluded on July 5 without giving the central committee a full shape. The Unified Socialist Party had announced that it would finalise the names of the remaining central members within ten days.Nepal and Bhusal retained their positions as party chair and general secretary, respectively, through the general convention after they were unanimously selected for the party’s two key positions. Former prime minister Khanal was also given continuity in his role as senior leader of the party.The party has yet to pick the remaining office bearers. As per its statute, the party will have 21 office bearers, including a chairman, a senior vice-chair, seven vice-chairs, including one woman, a general secretary, four deputy general secretaries, and seven secretaries.Ahead of the general convention, the leaders amended the party statute to increase the number of office bearers to 21, besides the senior leader.In August 2021, a group of CPN-UML leaders led by Nepal split the country’s largest communist party–CPN-UML–to form the Unified Socialist. \nThe Lions Club of Kathmandu Corporate, Nepal MD325-D has felicitated various personalities as part of its endeavour to recognise the contribution of the individuals and business entities for the society.As part of its campaign, the Lions Club of Kathmandu honoured Prateek Pradhan with Social Journalism Award, Sylapa T Rimponche with Social Spiritual Award, Erika Gurung with Social Player Award, Ramesh Corporation with Social Corporate House Award, Rajendra Malla with Social Corporate Leader Award and Rajesh Hamal with Social Celebrity Award.Likewise, Chandra Ghimire is honoured with Social Bureaucratic Award, Binod Das with Sports Management Award, Anil Kedia with Social Academic Award, Mohan Ojha with Social Management Award and Surya Nepal with Corporate Social Responsibility Award.The Lionism embarked in Nepal in 1971 as the Lions Club of Biratnagar under the stewardship of former Prime Minister Matrika Prasad Koirala.The Lions Clubs International says it has over 2,000 clubs operating across the nation. \nThe Kathmandu Metropolitan City has resumed pavement widening in the New Road area from Wednesday. Officials at the Public Construction Department under the metropolis said that the contractor resumed the work after the High Court, Patan issued an interim order paving the way for following an interim order from the High Court, Patan allowing the work to proceed. “Now there is no obstruction from locals nor from federal government agencies,” said Baburam Bhattarai, a member of the City Planning Commission under the KMC. “We hope that the project will be completed at the earliest.”The metropolis had awarded a contract to widen the sidewalks by 1.5 metres along both sides of the road section between the New Road gate and the Juddha Statue roundabout in the last fiscal year. The work started in the New Road area in May, but a jurisdictional dispute between the city office and the Road Division, Kathmandu, caused the project to come to a halt. The division confiscated contractors’ equipment, and the federal government deployed police in to prevent the city office from working. Some local residents, too, had demonstrated against the pavement widening plan. The division had even repaired the parts of roads cut for pavement expansion.And on June 9, the metropolis moved the High Court challenging the breach of jurisdiction by the road division, which is a federal agency, and its intervention in the city’s work.City officials were already frustrated by the years-long delay by federal agencies in completing another project, the widening of Kathmandu’s Ring Road in the Kalanki-Maharajgunj section, which has caused huge inconvenience to the public due to dust and mud.Mayor Balendra Shah then directed city officials to dump truckloads of dirt from the Ring Road section in front of the main entrance of the Road Division office at Minbhawan, accusing federal agencies of delaying the work.The 8.2km Kalanki-Maharajgunj section was set to be widened by the Chinese government, and the work was initially planned to start in early 2020, but the project has not progressed even after years due to Covid and delays in clearing the power poles and in some cases structures along the right of way.Regarding the jurisdiction dispute over the sidewalk widening work in the city, a division bench of judges Dhurba Raj Nand and Prakash Kharel at the High Court Patan issued an interim order in favour of the metropolis on Sunday.The City office has already widening pavements by 1 metre on both sides in the Bhrikutimandap area. “Neither did the federal government agency intervene, nor did locals object while expanding pavement in the Bhrikutimandap area by narrowing the road,” said Bhattarai. “Further decisions on pavement widening in other areas like Thamel, Handigaun and others will be taken after collecting public feedback.”Officials said that the long-term plan is to restrict motor vehicles altogether in the New Road area due to heavy pedestrian traffic. “We have also been working to find a solution to the parking problem and weighing various options including setting up multi-storey parking facilities,” said Bhattarai, who is also an urban planner.Officials said that pavements in the New Road area, which always remain crowded, should be widened to ensure free pedestrian movement. Officials claimed that New Road residents have also requested the city office to expand the pavement.According to city officials, local residents have, from time to time, complained about feeling unsafe and experiencing sexual harassment on the narrow and crowded sidewalks. \nIn a bid to prevent garbage from piling up on streets during the monsoon, the Kathmandu Metropolitan City has deployed heavy equipment including bulldozers, excavators, and loaders, to clear the road to the landfill site. Officials said the move aims to ensure smooth transfer of waste as roads to the landfill often become impassable during the monsoon, preventing the passage of garbage trucks.“We have deployed three excavators, two bulldozers and two loaders to clear landslide debris along the road to the Bancharedanda landfill,” said Rabinman Shrestha, chief of the Environment Department at the metropolis. “Also, we have kept five more vehicles on standby for immediate deployment if needed.”Every year, during monsoon season, the road to landfill sites gets obstructed in multiple places, obstructing the transfer of house waste collected in the three districts of the capital city—Kathmandu, Lalitpur, and Bhaktapur. Apart from these, some local levels of Kavrepalanchok also discard garbage at the landfill site at Bancharedanda.The metropolis officials said that they had purchased 10 high-pressure pumps to drain floodwaters from inundated settlements.“Five pumps have already been sent to the high-risk areas along riversides,” said Shrestha. “These can quickly pump away floodwaters.”The city office started repairing the Sisdole road leading to the Bancharedanda landfill in Nuwakot district just a few weeks before the start of the monsoon. Officials said Rs30 million had been allocated for repairs, which included fixing potholes, concreting roads, and other works.Around 200 metres of road near the Sisdole area, which is often damaged by garbage trucks and excavators, will be concretised, according to officials.Besides monsoon-induced road obstructions, garbage disposal is sometimes disrupted due to obstructions by the residents living in settlements near and around the landfill site. These obstructions cause weeks-long halt to door-to-door garbage collection, leading people in the Valley to discard their trash on streets.Officials said that a high-pressure pump is being used to prevent the overflow of leachate from the dumping ground.Landfill leachate is a hazardous liquid containing harmful bacteria, chemicals and other components. It forms when rainwater passes through a landfill or when organic matter decomposes naturally.Officials say the leachate needs to be re-injected into the landfill, which quickens the decomposition process of the landfill waste and prevents the liquid from flowing into the river. The City office has also started segregating degradable and bio-non-degradable waste materials from households in its seven wards. Wards 5, 7, 10, 12, 24 and 27 have been segregating the waste materials generated in the households. The city office has also arranged separate trucks for collecting segregated waste materials from the households.Degradable waste materials are being turned into compost at the KMC’s waste transfer station. Officials said that the metropolis has also been using reagents to expedite the compost-making process.The city office recently sold non-degradable waste worth Rs700,000.Waste segregation at the source was one of the measures Mayor Balendra Shah touted as a solution to Kathmandu’s chronic garbage problem. After he assumed office, Shah asked city residents to start segregating waste at the source. They started doing so, using separate bins in their homes. But the plan didn’t work, largely due to a lack of preparations on the KMC’s part.The Kathmandu Valley generates over 1,200 tonnes of solid waste every day, nearly 60 percent of which comes from the KMC alone. Experts say 60 percent of organic waste originating in the Valley can be converted into compost and the remaining 30 percent of non-degradable waste can be recycled. \nA year after rolling out the Nepal Trade Integration Strategy (NTIS), Nepal’s export of high-value products grew at a snail's pace in the last fiscal year.According to the statistics from the Trade and Export Promotion Centre, the export of high-value goods increased by 10 percent in the review period.NTIS 2023, which supersedes NTIS 2016, was implemented from the beginning of last fiscal year. The latest trade strategy is meant to support Nepal's graduation from the least developed country (LDC) status to a developing country by 2026.As per the statistics, export earnings from the goods identified by NTIS 2023 totalled Rs110.38 billion in the review period.Nepal’s total export amounted to Rs152.38 billion in the last fiscal year.The aim of NTIS 2023 is to diversify the export market for which a country-wise strategy was said to be prepared and implemented. But little has been done towards that end.“It’s true. Few works have been done for the implementation of the latest trade strategy and the result is not as expected,” said an official at the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Supplies requesting anonymity. There are problems in production, quality entrepreneurship development and global price competitiveness in the implementation of trade strategy. “We have started consultation with the private sector and stakeholders since the beginning of the current fiscal year regarding the legal, resource and other aspects of effective implementation of a trade strategy in the current fiscal year,” said the official.The ministry has got a budget of Rs34.5 million for the implementation of NTIS in the current fiscal year. Officials said that budget constraint is one of the problems in the full implementation of the trade strategy.According to the latest NTIS estimation, around Rs463 billion will be required for its implementation.The major target of NTIS 2023 is to attain Nepal’s trade-to-GDP ratio of 55 percent by 2026 from 43.81 percent in 2021. Trade is the sum of exports and imports of goods and services measured as a share of the gross domestic product (GDP).Proper coordination among the ministries and government bodies concerned is crucial for an effective implementation of the trade strategy but in the lack of the coordination there is a problem in budget mobilisation.“The development of entrepreneurship and its ecosystem from the private sector and increase in the government’s capital expenditure are also required to achieve the objective of NTIS.”Trade experts have been stressing for long that as Nepal is preparing to graduate from the “least developed” status by 2026, the increase in the export of high-value goods is not satisfactory which is not a good sign for the graduation.“The performances of former NTIS-listed goods were not good, demonstrating that Nepal failed to develop the products’ value chain. Making plans alone doesn’t work if they are not properly executed,” said Purushottam Ojha, former commerce secretary and trade expert in a recent interview with the Post. “There are problems in increasing and enhancing production, assuring quality and marketing Nepali products.”A major implication of LDC graduation is the loss of preferential market access available through LDC-specific schemes under the Generalised System of Preferences (GSP) and other arrangements.After LDC graduation, Nepal may lose a huge European market as it might not get facilities under the Everything But Arms (EBA) initiative. This scheme grants full duty-free and quota-free access to the European Union Single Market for all products (except arms and ammunition).There are around 184 activities for the implementation of the NTIS and provision requiring monitoring and evaluation. But the monitoring mechanism does not seem to have done its work, a trade expert said. There should be a dedicated review after a certain time gap, which helps focus on problematic issues.The export of iron and steel products, readymade garment, fabrics, medicinal herbs, cement, footwear, lentils, fruits, honey and textile, yarn and rope has increased in the last fiscal year.Shipment of iron and steel rose by 60 percent to Rs17.40 billion during the review period, making it top exportable goods from listed products. The export of iron and steel contributed 11.4 percent in total export share.Export of textile, yarn and rope increased by 30.09 percent to Rs19.22 billion contributing second largest export from Nepal. The export of textile, yarn and rope contributed 12.6 percent to the total export.Readymade garment export increased by 9.12 percent to Rs8.96 billion in the review period.The export of fabrics increased by 6.68 percent to Rs2.52 billion while medicinal herbs shipment increased by 19.27 percent to Rs2.25 billion.Cement shipment jumped by 449.05 percent to Rs1.97 billion during the review period. Footwear exports grew by 22.84 percent to Rs1.32 billion.Nepal’s lentils export increased by 14.12 percent to Rs568.47 million while fruits export jumped 517 percent to Rs19.02 million. The export of honey rose by 210.83 percent to Rs57.47 million.The exports of carpet, readymade garment, cardamom, jute and related products, felt products, dog food, pashmina, rosin and resin acid, ginger, handmade paper, silver and gold jewellery, vegetable, tea, coffee and spice fell in the last fiscal year compared to the previous one.Shipments of carpet from Nepal declined by 8.12 percent to Rs10.57 billion while cardamom export declined by 4.06 percent to Rs7.94 billion.Exports of jute and processed goods fell by 7.86 percent to Rs7.04 billion.Shipment of felt products dropped by 8.18 percent to Rs4.79 billion in the review period.Dog chew export came down by 6.59 percent to Rs3.18 billion in the last fiscal year. Shipment of pashmina also fell 5.32 percent to Rs3.02 billion.Export of rosin and resin acids declined by 10.51 percent to Rs1.47 billion. Shipment of Nepali paper declined by 10.18 percent to Rs1.02 billion.Gold and silver jewellery exports declined by 69.14 percent and 22.39 respectively to Rs58.23 million and Rs167.05 million accordingly.Nepal’s tea, coffee and spice exports shrank by 4.48 percent to Rs13.44 billion.Shipment of pasta fell by 14.38 percent to Rs1.96 billion during the review period. \nAt the Nepal Tourism Board, the country’s tourism promotional body, crises appear to be hovering all around again.Politicking at the board, which operates under a public-private partnership model, has been a long-standing problem, affecting its national and international tourism promotional plans for decades.Political manoeuvring becomes rampant when the time for appointing a chief executive officer (CEO) begins every four years. And the key tourism promotional body is already headless.Apart from the politics over the chief’s appointment, the board has yet to introduce its annual budget, a serious matter for the agency promoting Nepal abroad.“The board is in severe crisis,” said a top board official. The crisis arrived after most countries launched free-visa policies to attract tourists.Nepal plans to draw 1.6 million tourists this year, but that will not be possible without promotions. Amid all this, the country’s poor air safety has further hindered tourism growth, the official said. There is now tough global competition to attract tourists.Laos is extending its visa exemption policy and increasing visa validity for tourists from certain countries.The Thai cabinet has rolled out a series of new visa promotions, including visa-free and visa-on-arrival schemes, extended student stays, and reduced compulsory health insurance for retirees. Under the new scheme, visitors can stay in Thailand for up to 60 days, compared to the earlier limit of 30 days.Indonesia plans to introduce visa-free entry for tourists from 20 nations, including India, by October this year.In December last year, Malaysia granted visa-free entry to citizens of China and India for up to 30 days.Zimbabwe is giving a leg up to its tourism industry with a new visa-free entry policy for 35 countries.However, poor planning, unstable politics, and plane crashes have marred Nepal’s tourism, the country’s economic growth engine, at a time when most economic indicators are dim.The tourism board has been headless since January 30 when the term of its former CEO Dhananjay Regmi ended.On top of that, the board is yet to present its annual budget. “We are on a budget holiday,” said Mani Raj Lamichhane, spokesman for the Nepal Tourism Board. “From Sunday, there will be not a penny to spend on day-to-day activities.”As per the board’s financial bylaws, it has to bring the full budget by July 9. If the budget is not passed by then, it can manage expenses for day-to-day activities through a partial budget up to August 9. And there is a mandatory provision of passing the budget by August 19. If the budget is not passed by August 19, the tourism board may face a legal crisis. “We don’t know what will happen in that case,” said another senior board official.Officials say that given the ongoing crisis, the full budget seems impossible.Last fiscal year, the board earned Rs1.04 billion in tourism promotional fees charged to foreigners who departed from Kathmandu’s Tribhuvan International Airport, the main source of its budget. However, only 30 percent of it has been spent. The board estimates that it will introduce a Rs1.25 billion budget this fiscal year.Lamichhane said they met Tourism Minister Badri Pandey on Wednesday, and the minister assured them that the budget would be passed.Officials say frequent government changes have affected the functioning of the board, creating a leadership vacuum. Power tussles have become common among the board of directors, appointed by different ministers belonging to different parties at different times. “In the board of directors, the members face four different directions. No agendas can be approved.”The 11-member Nepal Tourism Board comprises five representatives, each from the government and the private sector, and the CEO. The tourism secretary chairs the board.As per the law, even a six-member board can pass the budget. “We don’t know what’s stopping the tourism secretary, the board chair, from doing that,” said the official.The CEO appointment, too, seems uncertain. As per the process, a three-member CEO selection committee should be formed to appoint the chief.The sub-committee shortlists three candidates based on their presentations and interviews and submits their names to the board, ultimately selecting the CEO within 90 days of the committee’s formation.After Regmi’s term ended, the board of directors initiated the process of appointing a new CEO. However, the applications were invited only on April 6. Twenty individuals, including Regmi, had applied for the executive position. The sub-committee had shortlisted 16 candidates. However, this was challenged when a writ petition was filed at the Patan High Court questioning the legality of the sub-committee members.On April 29, the joint bench of High Court Judges Sudarshan Dev Bhatta and Kailash Prasad Subedi continued the short-term interim order issued on April 22, ordering the halt of the CEO selection process. The next hearing was scheduled for Sunday. However, the government has declared Sunday a public holiday, on the occasion of Bhoto Jatra. On this day, the Machhindranath chariot festival concludes with the showing of the legendary vest at Jawalakhel in Lalitpur.Kundan Sharma Mishra, an official at the tourism board, filed the writ petition, contesting the legality of the two board members Milan Devkota and Madan Kumar Acharya, who were nominated to the CEO selection subcommittee. The director general of the Department of Tourism is another subcommittee member.“As per the law, the Cabinet should appoint board members. But it was former tourism minister Prem Ale who appointed the two board members. This minister-level decision is illegal. If the appointment is illegal, the CEO they select will also be illegal,” said Mishra.Devkota and Acharya were appointed in March 2022.The CEO appointment process had run into controversy even in the past.In 2011, the board had shortlisted 12 applicants in the first week of November.However, it was four years later, in December 2015, that the CEO was appointed. In that period, more than two dozen writs were filed in courts to halt or postpone the appointment process.The tourism board, established in 1998 under the public-private partnership model, is mandated to promote Nepal in domestic and international markets.But the board soon became a political playground. \nNepal has eased the foreign exchange facility for Nepali travellers, traders, and those with dollar accounts as the central bank is awash with foreign currencies, with a historic high of reserves.As of mid-June, the 11th month of the last fiscal year, the country had Rs1.96 trillion in foreign exchange reserves. The Nepal Rastra Bank’s own stock amounts to Rs1.75 trillion.The central bank said on Thursday that it amended the unified directives to allow Nepali citizens travelling abroad to carry $2,500 per trip. Earlier, Nepali citizens were allowed $2,500 twice a year.“Two years ago, we set the limitation on foreign exchange facilities in view of the country’s depleting foreign exchange reserves. Now we have amended the unified guidelines and removed the frequency limit as resources have improved. It will be helpful for frequent travellers,” said Ramu Paudel, spokesperson for the central bank.However, the limit of the amount of currency available remains unchanged. The amendments are based on the central bank's recently announced monetary policy for the current fiscal year.Similarly, the central bank has doubled the foreign currencies available to Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet, China, and the SAARC countries. Nepali citizens travelling to Tibet via surface route can now get an exchange facility of $1,000 one time and $2,000 in a fiscal year. This will also apply to Nepalis travelling to the SAARC countries, excluding India, via surface route.This provision, however, will not apply to the residents of border regions who make frequent travels to Tibet.The country’s foreign currency stock has been breaking records in recent months, mainly due to a robust remittance growth and ever-increasing migrant departures to foreign lands in search of better incomes.Economists say that robust forex reserves suggest a scenario of low investments, particularly in a least developed country like Nepal.In June 2022, Nepal’s foreign exchange reserves slid to a critical level that could sustain imports of goods for less than six months. Even the central bank's import controls did not improve the situation.Instead, the measures nearly suffocated Nepal’s economy, according to the International Monetary Fund.Following the Russia-Ukraine war, which choked the global supply system and caused prices to rise like never before, Nepal, too, suffered chronic current account deficits and was increasingly vulnerable to external economic shocks, while forex reserves dwindled fast.In late April 2022, the government banned imports of at least 10 goods considered luxury or non-essential in a bid to stop the country’s foreign exchange reserves from depleting further. The ban was lifted in December 2022.Paudel said that the foreign exchange ceiling has gone higher not only due to the improving forex reserve situation but also to prevent the hassles that travellers and traders are facing.People who travel frequently despite the limited forex convertibility were facing the problem of submitting documents required by the central bank, he said. “The amended provision will help such travellers.”The central bank has also amended the foreign exchange limitation for traders.According to the amended provision, traders who import goods through demand draft and telegraphic transfer are allowed to import goods of $100,000 at once, up from $60,000 before.Paudel said that the traders ordering goods beyond the limitations are required to submit documents to the central bank.But with the amendment, they can access needed facilities from any commercial bank.The amended provision has increased the payment limitation to import silver.Bullion traders importing silver to produce silver jewellery, artistic goods, and utensils, among other things, can get a foreign exchange facility of $300,000 per import. The other bullion traders importing silver can get a foreign exchange facility of $100,000 per import.The foreign exchange limitation for companies outsourcing services from foreign countries and invisible imports by domestic companies and their sister concerns has increased to $25,000 monthly from $15,000 monthly. \nMonsoon rains this year have brought with them a considerable amount of death and destruction. But they also bring some good news. Nepal has recorded one of the fastest paddy transplantation rates in many decades, courtesy of “above-normal rainfall”.According to the Department of Agriculture, the paddy transplantation rate reached 96 percent as of Wednesday. “Though details have yet to come, based on our inquiry, transplantation has been completed on 96 percent of the paddy fields,” said Arun Kafle, deputy director general of the department.He said Nepali farmers have been transplanting summer paddy at a rapid pace due to abundant rainfall, raising the prospect of a bumper harvest.This is believed to be the fastest transplantation rate in many decades. “Rainfall has been consistent, which is a boon for the crops, particularly paddy.”Agro experts say that due to the regular and abundant monsoon rains, the Madhesh province has surpassed Koshi province, its neighbour, in terms of paddy transplantation for the first time, which also surpassed the national average. Insufficient rainfall has long been a recurrent problem in the Madhesh province. A massive outflow of youths to foreign lands, creating a shortage of labourers to carry out agricultural activities, has added to the difficulties of local farmers.Agro experts say that transplanting dates differ from region to region.Early transplantation has some advantages. Agro economists say that early transplanted paddy mostly escapes pest attack, thereby reducing the additional cost of inputs in terms of pesticide application.Besides, it eases the next cycle of crops on the same field in a timely manner.“The most important part of early transplantation is that it increases the paddy areas,” said agro expert Rajendra Uprety, who is also the executive director at AgriGreen Nepal. “After transplantation, the next one-month period is critical for plant growth. If the rainfall is regular during the growth period, production will rise.”He said that in a few areas of eastern Nepal, a nutrition deficit has been observed due to the overuse of urea. Excessive urea use can easily damage other fertilisers and cause a nutrition deficit.“As urea is cheap, farmers use it without balancing it with other nutrients like potash and compost. This tendency has led to serious problems in many areas of Nepal.”In Nepal, the transplantation dates differ according to the availability of rainfall and geography. In the upper hills, paddy transplantation is completed by mid-June. In Tarai, the country’s food basket, it begins in early July and extends to early September, depending on water availability.The plains account for 71 percent of the total rice acreage. The hills account for 25 percent, and the mountain region 4 percent.Last year, low rainfall delayed transplantation in Madhesh Province, affecting production and productivity.According to the Department of Agriculture, the process had been completed on 92.4 percent of the 1.39 million hectares of land available for paddy cultivation as of Sunday.Paddy transplantation was at 78 percent in the same period last year. This year, the monsoon entered Nepal from the east on June 10, three days ahead of its usual onset date, according to the Meteorological Forecasting Division.Nepal’s economic well-being is closely tied to the rainy season. Rainwater is the lifeblood of Nepal's Rs5.7 trillion economy, which relies heavily on agriculture. Nearly two-thirds of the farmlands are rain-fed.During the four months from June to September, a large part of the country receives nearly 80 percent of its annual rainfall.The production of food grains, mainly rice, depends on the amount and distribution of monsoon rain over the country. The rains also replenish groundwater and reservoirs critical for drinking and power generation.According to the department, Madhesh Province had the lowest transplantation rate, at 58.8 percent, last year. This accelerated to 92 percent this year. Madhesh, which commands the lion’s share of the paddy fields (383,150 hectares), has completed transplantation on 352,443 hectares as of Wednesday. “The growth in productivity in Madhesh raises the overall national production. So, if the rainfall continues and there is no fertiliser shortage, Nepal could see a bumper paddy harvest this year,” said Kafle. Paddy is harvested from mid-October to November. Sudurpaschim Province saw the highest transplantation rate, at 99.6 percent of its 174,576 hectares, followed by Karnali Province, with 96.9 percent of its 41,904 hectares, Madhesh Province, with 92 percent, and Gandaki Province’s 91.9 percent of 96,053 hectares.The rate in Lumbini province has been recorded at 91.3 percent of 311,643 hectares. In Bagmati Province, transplantation is complete on 90.8 percent of its 112,273 hectares. The Koshi province saw the lowest transplantation rate of 90.7 percent of 276,386 hectares. Paddy is Nepal’s biggest earning farm commodity, with tens of thousands of farmers relying on its income. According to economists, the high output may cool down inflation and pump up the economy. \nAmid monsoon rains causing widespread death and destruction, the risk of infection of water- and vector-borne diseases intensifies.Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population are bracing for tough days ahead, as the escalating monsoon not only pollutes sources of drinking water but also provides breeding grounds for various disease-spreading vectors.“Over 2,000 people from 73 districts have already tested positive for the dengue virus and several districts have witnessed outbreaks of waterborne diseases, including cholera,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We are aware of the possible risks and have alerted the relevant agencies.”The division said that 23 cholera cases have already been confirmed in Lalitpur, Kailali and Kathmandu districts. Likewise, as many as 2,061 people from 73 districts have tested positive for dengue. Health facilities across the country have been grappling with a surge in water- and vector-borne diseases. “Infection of the dengue virus has not risen this time compared to the previous years,” said Ghimire. “Ongoing rain has contaminated drinking water sources which increases the risk of potential outbreaks of waterborne diseases in the coming days.”According to data provided by the division, among the 73 districts that reported dengue outbreaks, Kathmandu has the highest number of cases at 249, followed by Jhapa 130, Chitwan 105, Tanahun 87, Makawanpur 78, Kaski 74, Bhojpur 62, Kavrepalanchok 60, and Okhaldhunga with 59 cases.Dengue is a mosquito-borne disease transmitted by female Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus mosquitoes. The same vector also transmits chikungunya, yellow fever, and Zika, according to the World Health Organisation.Public health experts say reported cases could be just the tip of the iceberg, as around 80 percent of those infected are asymptomatic. Likewise, cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported only from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in Kathmandu Valley and 10 in Kailali district.The monsoon season in Nepal is a time of epidemics during which thousands of people across the country become infected with waterborne and vector-borne diseases. Officials warned that health facilities could witness an uptick in the number of viral fever cases, and waterborne diseases—diarrhoea, dysentery, food poisoning, and snakebites—in the coming days.The Ministry of Health and Population last month urged provincial and local health authorities not to grant leave to health workers during the monsoon season and step up vigilance about the potential risks.Officials say that they have been raising awareness through all available means to inform people of the risks and directed agencies concerned to stockpile essential medicines.Doctors say the only ways to prevent deaths from waterborne diseases, including diarrhoea, are to raise awareness and ensure safe drinking water.They say a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation and treatment are required to contain the spread of the diarrhoeal infection. \nAt least 20 diarrhoeal patients—12 from Lalitpur, eight from Kailali and two from Kathmandu—were found to have contracted cholera recently. People residing in other districts may have also been infected with the deadly disease, but due to absence of an active cholera surveillance programme in most of the districts, no one knows what is going on.“Active cholera surveillance is being carried out only in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and Bhaktapur—and in Kailali,” said Dr Hemanta Chandra Ojha, an official at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have a system in place in other districts as well but intensive surveillance is being carried out in Kathmandu Valley and in Kailali only.”Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool samples of the infected patients. They concede that the outbreaks of the deadly disease are being reported from the districts having active case surveillance programmes. Active cholera surveillance is being carried out from 27 health facilities in the Valley and 10 in Kailali district.“Report of cholera outbreak in districts having intensive cholera surveillance is an obvious thing, as we carry out testing only when we find problems,” said an official at the Department of Health Services, asking not to be named as he is not authorised to talk to the media. “We will not know anything about the cause of disease outbreaks, if we stopped testing.”Officials at the Ministry of Health and Population, however, claimed that even if active cholera surveillance programmes are not in place in most of the districts, systems are in place to collect stool samples of the diarrhoeal patients and send them for lab testing if needed.“We have provincial public health laboratories in all provinces that can carry out cholera testing, and we also bring samples to the National Public Health Laboratory for examination when a massive diarrheal outbreak occurs,” said Ojha of the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division. “We have an Integrated Health Information Management System and Early Warning, Alert and Response System, which reports about the disease outbreaks. Active surveillance is being carried out only in high risk districts.”Officials, who wish not to be quoted in news as they fear retribution for speaking to the media, however, said that Integrated Health Information Management System only provides monthly reports; moreover, the system provides only clinical reports, not the reports of lab testing. The Early Warning, Alert and Response System is also not very effective.“The thing is systems on which health authorities rely much do not give an exact picture of the disease outbreak, and such systems do not help contain massive outbreaks,” the official said. “Major outbreaks of waterborne disease could happen at any time and at any place, and authorities concerned get alerted only after loss.”Health officials concede that it is not the government that is carrying out active surveillance of the deadly disease in four districts but the International Vaccine Institute, Korea. When asked why the government does not think it necessary to carry out active cholera surveillance in other districts, they said that the existing health budget is insufficient for the task.Cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season are not a new thing in Nepal, as hundreds of people throughout the country suffer from diarrhoeal infections that continue for months every year and scores contract the disease.In 2022, a total of 77 cholera cases were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in Kathmandu Metropolitan City’s wards 11, 12, and 13, which were highly affected by the outbreak.Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.They say sheer negligence from authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrhoeal diseases including the deadly cholera.Health authorities in most local units had stopped the testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season, citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, the presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.Doctors say bottled water, which is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley, is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Dangerous microbes are detected in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.To contain the spread of the infection, a combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nThe polio immunisation drive launched in the Kathmandu Valley a week ago has achieved an impressive 104 percent coverage rate. This is not the first time coverage rate of a healthcare campaign has exceeded 100 percent.What concerns public health experts is that even if the coverage of the health campaign exceeds 100 percent every time, post-campaign surveys reveal actual coverage falling short.“We don’t have the exact count of the floating population or those living in the city slums,” said Dr Arjun Spkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Moreover there are refugees in the capital. Providing healthcare programmes to these groups is always a challenge. Chances of children missing vaccination or other health campaigns is always high in big and crowded cities like in the Kathmandu Valley.”Health authorities launched a special immunisation programme in the three districts of the Valley—Kathmandu, Lalitpur and in Bhaktapur—following the detection of a highly contagious poliovirus in sewage samples.Officials say that presence of type-3 poliovirus in sewage samples has been confirmed by the National Institute of Health of Thailand, a World Health Organisation’s collaborating centre. The virus, which originated from a vaccine, was detected in sewage samples collected from the confluence of the Tukucha and Bagmati Rivers [in Kathmandu] on May 26, according to them.Nepal has been polio-free since 2010, but was officially declared polio-free by the World Health Organisation only on March 27, 2014, after maintaining zero polio cases for three consecutive years.After having zero human cases of polio for about 14 years, the infectious disease has surfaced in the capital city’s sewage, which is a serious problem, according to public health officials. They said that the presence of poliovirus in sewage samples indicates the looming risk of an outbreak.The Immunisation Section at the Family Welfare Division under the Department of Health Services had planned to carry out a four-day polio vaccination in all three districts of the Valley from July 24 but later extended for a week.All children under five years of age have been inoculated with an additional dose of oral polio vaccine in the drive.Oral polio vaccine, which consists of Type-1 and Type-3 polioviruses have been administered during the campaign. Health workers and female community health volunteers were deployed to homes, schools, bus parks, and entry points to ensure that no eligible children miss the vaccine. “We found over 3,000 children living in city slums,” said Dr Abhiyan Gautam, chief of the Immunisation Section. “We are aware that children might still miss the vaccine despite our best efforts to meet the target.”The health ministry said that the vaccine coverage rate for polio is 95 throughout the country. An estimated 300,000 children live in three districts of the Valley. But the 104 percent coverage rate shows that more children reside in the Valley than estimated. Health authorities do not have exact data on the people residing in the city slums. Floating population, scattered slums, high density of working-class people, and lack of awareness and poor access to health services are some of the challenges identified in improving health indicators, experts say. They urge the authorities to focus on high-risk groups when designing health programs, as vulnerable populations are always disproportionately affected during disease outbreaks.Doctors say the poliovirus mainly affects children and is usually transmitted through droplets or aerosols from the throat and by faecal contamination of hands, utensils, food and water. Those who do not wash their hands properly, and those who consume contaminated food and water or reside in an area where water and sanitation conditions are poor are at high risk of getting infected with the virus.Experts urge health authorities to carry out post-campaign surveys to know the actual coverage of the campaign.“Achieving 104 percent coverage is more of an administrative number,” said Upreti, former director general, who is also a child health expert. “Health authorities must carry out a post-campaign survey to reveal the true picture.”Regular immunisation is one of the most successful programmes in Nepal, boasting a high coverage rate. The country has made remarkable progress in reducing the under-five mortality rate and the regular immunisation programmes are credited with this achievement. \nAt least three diarrheal patients— one from Kalimati in Kathmandu Metropolitan City, one from Tokha Municipality, and another from Gwarko of Lalitpur district—have tested positive for cholera. Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu said that the National Public Health Laboratory, which carried out testing on stool samples of diarrheal patients, confirmed cholera infection on Monday evening.“Reports from the laboratory confirmed cholera outbreaks in additional three places in the Valley, including two areas in Kathmandu,” said Dr Arjun Sapkota, chief of Health Office Kathmandu. “Earlier rapid diagnostic tests too had shown cholera infection in those patients.” With these additional cases, the total number of diarrheal patients testing positive for cholera across the country has reached 16 within a week. Last week, cholera outbreaks were reported in Godawari Municipality of Lalitpur district and Dhangadhi Sub-metropolitan City of Kailali district.At least 13 people—seven in Godawari Municipality and six in Dhangadhi Sub-metropolis tested positive for cholera, according to officials at the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division.Cholera is a highly infectious disease that causes severe diarrhoea and vomiting, which in turn results in dehydration and can lead to death within a few hours if left untreated. The World Health Organisation says cholera is a global threat to public health and an indicator of inequality and a lack of social development.Health officials said that the Vibrio cholera 01 Ogawa serotype has been confirmed in the stool sample of an infected patient. Health officials concede that the outbreak of the deadly disease in several places at once shows that the cholera has spread to multiple locations of the Valley.According to Officials at the Health Office Kathmandu, the infected patients have been admitted at the Sukraraj Tropical and Infectious Disease Hospital and Chabahil-based Helping Hands Community Hospital. Following news of the suspected cholera outbreak, the Epidemiology and Disease Control Division, along with Health Office Kathmandu and the local units, which are responsible for responding to the disease outbreaks, scrambled to contain the spread of the infection.“Contaminated water is the main culprit behind the cholera outbreaks in Lalitpur and Kailali,” said Dr Yadu Chandra Ghimire, director at the division. “Various programmes including water and sanitation initiatives, and awareness campaigns, are being organised in the affected areas.”The Kathmandu Valley often witnesses cholera outbreaks during the monsoon season, with hundreds of people suffering from diarrheal infections that continue for months. Public health experts say that due to poor sanitation and hygiene conditions, the country as a whole is highly vulnerable to water-borne illnesses including diarrhoea, dysentery, typhoid, hepatitis, and cholera, with thousands of people getting infected every year.This year too, major hospitals in Kathmandu Valley have been grappling with a surge in cases of water-borne diseases including severe diarrhoea. “Fifteen to 20 diarrheal patients have been seeking care in our emergency department every day,” said Dr Ravi Shakya, director at the Patan Hospital. In 2022, a total of 77 cases of cholera were confirmed in the Valley. Last year, health authorities administered an oral cholera vaccine in wards 11, 12, and 13 of the Kathmandu Metropolitan City, which were highly affected by the outbreak. Public health experts said that sheer negligence from parts of authorities concerned is responsible for ongoing outbreak of diarrheal disease including deadly cholera. Health authorities in most local units had stopped testing of drinking water just before the start of the monsoon season citing lack of funds, although deadly microbes such as faecal coliform and E coli were frequently detected in drinking water samples.Faecal coliform and E coli, both microscopic organisms, are found in human faeces. According to doctors, their presence of faecal coliform and E coli in drinking water means it is contaminated with sewage.“Ensuring water quality is a regular job and basic duty of the relevant agency,” said Dr Sher Bahadur Pun, chief of Clinical Research Unit at the Sukraraj Hospital. “Such essential services should not be halted under any conditions.”Doctors say bottled water is widely used by households and offices in Kathmandu Valley and is generally considered safe, but water quality of several companies have been found questionable. Presence of dangerous microbes in bottled water every year, which means not all jar water brands are safe to drink without treatment.Doctors have asked authorities to launch awareness drives against water-borne diseases and ensure safe drinking water to prevent deaths from illnesses like cholera.A combination of careful surveys, ensuring safe drinking water, maintaining sanitation and hygiene, social mobilisation, and treatment is required to contain the spread of the infection, according to doctors.The World Health Organisation also said that a multifaceted approach is key to controlling cholera and reducing deaths. \nOver the decade, Nepali doctors, categorised as “foreign national residents” in India’s prestigious All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), have been deprived of stipends.On June 26, Dr Indra Shekhar Prasad, the president of the Resident Doctors Association (RDA), and Raghunandan Dixit, general secretary of the RDA, wrote to the director of AIIMS and raised the issue of non-payment of stipends to the foreign national residents at AIIMS.“This long-standing grievance demands immediate redressal and your decisive intervention,” the letter said. “The RDA has tirelessly advocated for the rights of these residents, who contribute to AIIMS's mission despite facing this glaring injustice.”Most of the foreign students are from Nepal. Ekata Vyas, who campaigns on behalf of the Nepali students—estimated to number at least 60—told the Post that she is hoping for positive results this time. She has received positive feedback and responses from New Delhi and the Indian Embassy in Kathmandu. The monthly stipend ranges from IRs 90,000 to 1,20,000.Besides taking up the matter, the foreign national doctors, mostly from Nepal, took up the issue before 2011. According to the Nepali doctors who are serving in AIIMS, a case was filed in the Delhi High Court against the discriminatory provision over the stipends and arrears in 2011. The Delhi Court gave its verdict in favour of the students on July 16. In 2013, however, the AIIMS filed a counter case which was made absolute on December 4, 2017, after 27 hearings, most of them just formalities marked by absences on the bench and of defendants. A Nepali student said that since they did not have the time and resources to follow up on the case in court, it was dismissed. “Then, we started discussing the matter with government officials and diplomats,” said the student.During the Nepal visit of Indian prime minister Narendra Modi in 2018, then-prime minister KP Sharma Oli also took up the matter with the Indian delegation.“Then we came to know that the India prime minister's office directed the Ministry of External Affairs to look into the matter and expedite its resolution. The Indian Embassy in Kathmandu also confirmed to India’s Ministry of External Affairs that Indian students in similar courses are getting stipends equal to their Nepali counterparts from their respective institutions in Nepal. In May 2018, India’s Ministry of External Affairs wrote to the Ministry of Health and Family Affairs to examine and expedite the prime minister’s directive.Then, India’s health ministry wrote to AIIMS, the Jawaharlal Institute of Postgraduate Medical Education and Research (JPIMER), and the Postgraduate Institute of Medical Education and Research (PGIMER), Chandigarh, seeking the details of the foreign national residents.“It is pertinent to note that esteemed institutions such as JIPMER and PGIMER have already rectified similar issues by ensuring stipend payments to their Foreign National Residents as early as 2020. AIIMS, renowned for its commitment to excellence and equity, cannot afford to lag behind in such matters of principle. As representatives of the RDA, we assert that the workload and dedication of Foreign National Residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,” the RDA stated in its letter to the AIIMS director.After two premier health institutions started providing the stipends in April 2020, the Resident Doctors Association of AIIMS wrote to the Prime Minister's Office in India seeking its intervention and solidarity with the foreign national residents who have been deprived of the stipends for the past decade.Again in May of the same year, the AIIMS association wrote to the AIIMS director to recognise the efforts by foreign national residents during the pandemic and consider resuming the stipend, but the request went unheard.In January 2023, the AIIMS issued a public notice stating that the government of Nepal should sponsor these students.Nepal’s foreign ministry then clarified that the Nepali students had competed openly and were selected on merit with no sponsorship or role of the government of Nepal. It directed the Nepali Embassy in New Delhi to look into the matter. “We took up the issue with prime minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal and urged him to raise the matter while meeting with Modi,” said the Nepali doctors. “In September, 2023, the Supreme Court of India issued a verdict in a similar case stating that nonpayment of stipend cannot be justified.”Arguing that it is equivalent to bonded labour, the verdict directed the Medical Council to take note of instances in which the stipend is not paid.The Indian government informed the Supreme Court of India that, as per its directive, action will be taken to ensure that there is parity in medical education. “We again wrote to the foreign minister of Nepal, the Nepali Embassy, and the Indian Embassy to discuss the matter during the bilateral commission meeting scheduled for the first week of January 2024,” a Nepali doctor said.Both foreign minister NP Saud and Nepal’s ambassador Shankar Sharma took up the matter during the seventh joint commission meeting held in Kathmandu, according to the students.Then, several meetings were held, correspondence was made by the resident doctors of AIIMS, and Nepali students submitted applications to the health minister of India, people informed on the matter said.\"RDA asserts that the workload and dedication of foreign national residents are equivalent to their peers who receive stipends,\" said RDA President Dr Inder Shekhar Prasad. \"Denial of their stipends not only undermines their morale but also tarnishes AIIMS's reputation as a beacon of medical education and equality.\"The Nepali doctors said that since India has come up with a new budget, they hope their long struggle for getting stipends will be resolved. \nI can vividly remember my first encounter with baking when I was 10 years old. We had just moved to our new home and got a cable connection. The cable opened a world of possibilities, as it gave me access to various contents.This was back in the late 2000s when YouTube would take hours to load, taunting us with its buffering screen. I was particularly drawn to travel and lifestyle channels, mainly TLC, Fox Life, and Food Network, which kept me informed about different foods and cultures. I don’t know why, but I was always drawn to desserts. It was fascinating to see how these miraculous treats made people smile at the end of the meal.Growing up in Nepal, I noticed that baking wasn't very common. While some families did have ovens, they were mostly multifunctional ones used primarily for heating food.I also noticed that most of our desserts didn't require an oven, as they could be made on a stovetop. So, you can imagine my excitement when my mom decided to buy an oven during one of her festive shopping sprees.I could finally feel the joy these channels portrayed. (I blame food writer Nigella Lawson for getting me hooked on a domestic lifestyle.) Then, one day, after watching one of the cooking episodes on television, I finally mustered enough strength and decided to bake something. I distinctly remember wanting to make a chocolate cake for myself after watching one of Rachel Allen’s bake series. I watched all the ingredients used in that recipe and scurried across my pantry, only to realise I didn’t have half of the stuff she mentioned. I then decided to improvise the recipe (a big mistake). I randomly combined the ingredients that I had in a mixing bowl and chucked the batter into my oven, hoping for a magical cake to pop out an hour later.After I saw the result an hour later, I was mortified. The cake was stuck in the pan, refusing to come out, and it was as dense as fudge. I convinced myself that the taste was what mattered most, but when I served a slice to my brother, he made a face of utter disgust.That was the day I realised that baking soda was not the same as baking powder.After this incident, I researched baking and found out it was technical. This was a blessing in disguise for me, as I loved science, and I started to view baking as a science experiment. I then reflected and evaluated how to perfect one's baking skills.I analysed my errors and noted down all the steps I did every time I baked. Home baking is a passion for many. The idea of turning a few simple ingredients into a delicious masterpiece is as enchanting as it sounds.Yet, for many of us, this seemingly magical process can often turn into a series of unfortunate events, leading to crumbled dreams and deflated ambitions. Dense cakes, burnt crusts, rock-hard cookies and unrisen bread, if you are an amateur baker, then you have seen it all. But why do these mishaps happen so often? And most importantly how do we overcome them?From my experience, behind every successful bake lies a series of challenges and mishaps that test even the most dedicated bakers. Baking has its own set of rules that you need to follow to get that scrumptious treat every time. So, to transform a recipe into an actual dish that will impress your friends and family, I am sharing with you some of the tips and tricks I learned from my tumultuous journey as a home baker.First things first, we have to look into the prime appliance that we are working with. Commercial ovens are of two types: one that runs on gas and the other that runs on electricity. We have to look at the oven present at our home and consider its pros and cons. The main benefits of a gas oven are its size and temperature control. One can quickly change the temperature just by twisting the knob, and it preheats much more quickly than an electric one. However, they are known to have uneven temperatures at times and release more humidity, making it harder to properly crisp or brown food. This can result in burnt edges and cold or hot spots. An electric oven, on the other hand, provides more even and consistent temperatures and doesn’t release as much moisture in the air.This dry oven environment makes it easier to brown your items, making it great for baking bread. However, while the dry oven results in more even cooking, you also run the risk of drying out cakes and other baked goods.Also, many people forget to preheat the oven before baking, which is crucial for maintaining an even temperature throughout the baking process. When baking cakes and bread, I like to place a small tray of water at the bottom of the oven to provide moisture and prevent the baked goods from drying out.An oven thermometer can be a baker's best friend, providing a true reading and ensuring your creations bake evenly. I also like rotating the pan midway while baking, as it allows for an even distribution of heat.The next thing people mess up on is measuring and the specificity of ingredients in a recipe. Our moms made our food with their instinct; it is something that they learned along the way, but when you are baking, you cannot instinctively add or omit a few steps.I think that is why we initially had problems with baking. In a culture where cooking comes instinctually, baking challenges us, to be precise. A gram of more or less of any ingredient can drastically alter the outcome. Different methods of measuring flour can yield different results.Every component in baking serves a distinct purpose and function. Flour offers structure, sugar adds sweetness and moisture, eggs bind things together, and butter enhances taste and texture. However, not all ingredients are created equally. For example, using salted butter instead of unsalted might change the taste profile of your meal.Similarly, different flours have varying protein concentrations, which affect the texture of baked goods. The type of sugar used also makes a difference. Granulated sugar, brown sugar, powdered sugar, and speciality sugars like turbinado or muscovado each add unique flavours to a bake.Understanding these nuances and how they interact is critical for getting the intended outcomes. Accurate measurement tools and techniques are essential, but mastering them can be a steep learning curve. So, I would recommend investing in a kitchen scale that allows for more accurate measurements by weight rather than volume.Moving on, leavening agents such as baking soda, baking powder, and yeast are required to make baked goods rise. However, they can also cause confusion and errors. Baking soda needs an acidic component to activate, but baking powder has both an acid and a base, making it self-activating.Using the wrong type of flour or sugar, or using them in incorrect proportions, can result in flat, overly raised, or collapsed cakes. Yeast, being a living organism, presents its challenges.The water temperature must be just right—not too hot to kill the yeast, nor too cold to inhibit its activity. Proofing times and conditions also need to be carefully managed to achieve the perfect rise.Bakers should also be careful about the way they mix ingredients. The method of mixing ingredients can significantly impact the final product. Over-mixing can develop too much gluten in cakes and pastries, leading to tough textures.Under-mixing can leave pockets of unincorporated ingredients, resulting in uneven bakes. Techniques like folding, creaming, and whipping each serve specific purposes and must be executed with care.Finally, home bakers must understand the importance of timing and patience in baking. Even a minute or two can make the difference between perfectly baked cookies and burnt edges.Recipes often provide a range for baking times, but factors like oven hot spots, pan material, and altitude can affect these times. It’s crucial to keep a close eye on your bakes and rely on visual and tactile cues, such as a cake pulling away from the sides of the pan or a toothpick coming out clean, to determine doneness.Baking is also an exercise in patience, a virtue not everyone possesses. Doughs need time to rest and rise, flavours need time to meld, and baked goods need time to cool before they can be enjoyed.Impatience can lead to underbaked centres, crumbling slices, and a general sense of frustration. Cultivating patience is as important as mastering any technique in the baker’s repertoire.Home baking is a journey full of ups and downs, but it comes with great rewards. The obstacles encountered teach valuable lessons in patience, precision, and perseverance.The satisfaction of success, the freedom to create, and the therapeutic benefits make the endeavour meaningful. Whether baking for oneself, loved ones, or as an artistic outlet, the journey is as fulfilling as the result. Embrace the flour-dusted countertops, occasional setbacks, and the joys of home bakingFor a beginner-friendly recipe that involves mixing ingredients and delivers amazing results, try my recipe for fudgy, nutty brownies that I call ‘Bliss Brownies’.Bliss Brownies150g unsalted butter plus extra for the tin150g chopped dark chocolate200g caster sugar½ tsp baking powder2 eggs80g cocoa powder150g plain flour70g mixture of nuts (walnuts and almonds)60g blended papayaMix all the ingredients (except the dark chocolate and nuts) in a blender or a food processor and blitz till you get a smooth paste.Fold the chocolate and the nuts into the brownie batter, making sure that the pieces are evenly mixed in.Grease a loaf pan with soft butter and dust with cocoa powder. Pour the batter into the loaf pan.Bake in a preheated oven at 170c for 40 minutes and let it cool in the oven for an hour. Enjoy with a cup of coffee or, as I like it, a scoop of vanilla ice cream. \nIn a world where acceptance and safety often seem difficult to attain, many queer individuals also struggle to find a safe space to express themselves. They have to hide their true self and face relentless judgement when going to public places like cafes and restaurants.This is the reality for countless LGBTQIA+ individuals. The need for a safe space for this community is not just a desire but a necessity—a space where one can be themselves. This struggle for safety and acceptance can be traced to crucial historical moments, such as the Stonewall Riots of 1969 in New York City.The Stonewall Inn was more than a bar; it was a refuge for the queer community. When police raided the bar, the community fought back. This series of violent confrontations, which began in the early hours of June 28, 1969, between police and gay rights activists, marked the beginning of the modern LGBTQIA+ rights movement. The spirit of Stonewall, the fight for dignity and the right to exist openly lives on in places like Inclusive Galaxy Restaurant in Kathmandu. Inclusive Galaxy beyond a restaurant is an ‘oasis’ for the queer community and beyond.Founded by Bishwaraj Adhikari, Mr Gay Handsome Nepal 2013, a human rights defender, the restaurant proves the power of safe spaces. It’s a place where the community can unite, free from the prejudice and hostility that often permeate their everyday lives.After years of working in the human rights sector, Adhikari and his partner developed the idea for Inclusive Galaxy. What began as a small cafe gradually evolved into a full-fledged restaurant, driven by the growing demand and support from the community.“In developed countries with strong LGBTQIA+ movements, you can find community areas like gay villages. These are created as safe spaces for people whose families and communities have excluded them. They also support new business ideas and pink tourism. I hope to see pink tourism develop in Nepal someday,” says Adhikari. His vision for Inclusive Galaxy goes beyond just being a restaurant. He aims to promote financial independence and empowerment within the queer community.Since its inception in February 2019, Inclusive Galaxy has become a key spot for many in Lazimpat, a relatively queer-friendly area in Kathmandu. The location is essential because the first LGBTQIA+ movement in Nepal started in 2001 through the Blue Diamond Society.Inclusive Galaxy, true to its name, welcomes everyone—queer and non-queer alike—to share a comfortable space. His vision was clear: to create a space where people of all genders and sexual identities could come together without fear of exclusion.“I didn’t want to make it exclusively for queer people because that would be excluding ourselves from society. Different groups need to live together and understand each other,” Adhikari explains.In the early days, the cafe attracted both queer and non-queer customers. However, when some of the residents learned about Adhikari’s identity and the nature of the clientele, there was a brief period of hesitation. “At first, I didn’t understand what was happening, but then I realised my identity was an issue for a few people. I believe people should be judged by others by their character, not by their gender or sexuality. Over time, as residents saw that we operated like any other cafe, they became more comfortable,” Adhikari reflects.Adhikari started Inclusive Galaxy to give queer individuals a place to be proud of themselves, counteracting the self-doubt and insecurity that hiding one’s identity can cause. This turned the cafe very quickly into a community hub. The journey was not without challenges, though. It was difficult to hire staff and cooks from the LGBTQIA+ community, and soon after the restaurant opened, the COVID pandemic made things even harder.Despite these difficulties, the doors of Inclusive Galaxy remained open. During the pandemic, many queer individuals, who were abandoned by their families or afraid to return home, found comfort at Inclusive Galaxy.Since many couldn’t afford to pay for meals, the restaurant provided free food from its resources. As the number of people needing meals grew to 20-30 daily, Adhikari started raising funds within the community.“During my time as an activist, many people came here not only for food but also to see an organisation where the queer community supports one another,” Adhikari says.“The time during COVID was difficult, but it brought me closer to the community.”Four years after its inception, the restaurant has garnered a loyal following. Sarosy Neupane, Miss Pink Nepal 2024 first runner-up, describes Inclusive Galaxy as her second home. She moved to Kathmandu to study in 2022. Being distant from her family, she started visiting Galaxy for meals that reminded her of home-cooked food. Over time, she grew attached to the café because of its welcoming atmosphere.“It’s heartwarming to see people from our community and different walks of life here. The founders even invite us to festivals like ‘Dahi Chiura Khane din,’” she shares.Neupane visits the cafe regularly and sometimes stays until 3 am, engrossed in conversations. “I hope more spaces like this can open in the future. If, unfortunately, this place were to close someday, I don’t think we’d have any other place to turn to,” she adds.Muna Chhetri, a trans woman who has been a loyal customer for three years, shares, “This is my safe space where I can truly be myself. I always feel judged in other restaurants, but that fear doesn’t exist here. It’s where even those who aren’t accepted at home can feel accepted.”Sahara Khadka Chhetri, owner of Pink Tiffany, Kathmandu’s first openly LGBTIQIA+ friendly restaurant and bar, frequently visits after managing the bar, appreciating the convenience of not cooking at home.She notes very few places like this cater to our community, and some even had to close during COVID. “As an entrepreneur, I know that sustaining these spaces is a challenge. But as more spaces like these open, they will make the way for a more inclusive and compassionate society.”The welcoming atmosphere at Inclusive Galaxy has also had a surprising effect on non-queer patrons. Samriddha Jung Rana, a twenty-year-old neighbour who identifies as straight, often visits the café and appreciates the importance of such spaces.“Previously, I didn’t know much about the queer community and didn’t care much. But now, coming into this café, I’ve been interested in their rights and issues. I’ve realised that we’re not so different after all. We are all human,” he remarks.The ventures like Inclusive Galaxy and Pink Tiffany have inspired hope for collaborative businesses between queer and non-queer groups. The recent initiative by the Nepal Tourism Board promoting Pink Tourism in April 2024 is a positive step. Still, Adhikari believes that more support is needed from the government and the private sector.Despite the progress, challenges remain. However, Adhikari remains optimistic about the future. He is working on plans to develop the restaurant into a homestay program in the future.“Like how different planets, asteroids, and stars make up a beautiful galaxy, people from all walks of life and identities make a beautiful society. I am happy that we are assimilating together in this space. We are not so different; we are all different and similar simultaneously,” he says. \nAditya Mishra is a Nepali chef and entrepreneur based in New York. Passionate about elevating Nepali cuisine globally, Mishra sharpened his culinary skills while staging at various Michelin-starred restaurants in the city during his time at culinary school. A recipient of the James Beard Foundation National Scholars Scholarship in 2023, Mishra’s early experiences inspired him to establish his own supper club, ‘The Sewing Tin’, alongside co-founder Akhil Upad.In an interview with Post’s Aarati Ray, Mishra discusses his restaurant in New York, serving Nepali cuisines there and the recipe for his signature dish.How did your cooking journey start in New York?At 14, I told my parents I wanted to be a chef, but they preferred I pursue a stable career like engineering, as many Nepali families do. So, I left for Louisiana in 2019 to study engineering.But, cooking never left my heart so, after a year, I left engineering college and moved to New York City. It’s been three and a half years and my parents only learned about it later. When my mom visited me in NYC and saw my dedication to cooking, she saw my passion and supported my decision.What sparked your interest in cooking from a young age?As a child, I was drawn to cooking shows on TLC. The glamour of cooking, eating, travelling and the prosperity of famous chefs was fascinating.Around age 16, I discovered Chef Anthony Bourdain’s groundbreaking book, ‘Kitchen Confidential’, which shed light on the reality of the culinary industry. I learned how he became a cultural icon in NYC, reshaping perceptions of chefs.I was also fascinated by chefs like Marco Pierre White, who was a mentor to Gordon Ramsay. Their stories of achieving fame while maintaining discipline intrigued me. But, as I grew older and entered the culinary world, I realised it was far from glamorous—it involved dedication and I am glad I persevered.How did the idea for The Sewing Tin originate?The concept of ‘The Sewing Tin’ came when I realised the stark contrast between the romanticised view of kitchen work and its harsh reality. Witnessing the struggles of many kitchen staff—economic hardships, immigration challenges and language barriers—I had to rediscover my love for cooking.During my internship at ‘Junoon’ restaurant, I met my co-founder, Akhil Upad, who shared my culinary enthusiasm despite his preparations for medical college. Together, we wanted to create a dining experience that was more personal and communal, offering fine dining with a sense of community.We wanted our food to tell stories, so we named our restaurant ‘The Sewing Tin’ inspired by the immigrant experience in NYC. When immigrants opened cookie boxes as kids, they often found sewing supplies instead of food.‘The Sewing Tin’ is like opening a cookie box and finding sewing supplies—something uniquely desi, or South Asian. How do you promote Nepali cuisine in New York City through The Sewing Tin?My partner is from Atlanta with Indian roots, while I come from Nepal, so our menu celebrates and reflects both cultures and heritage.We represent our respective cultures authentically. For example, we have a dish inspired by Newari cuisine called kachaila, similar to French Tartar. We present it as Tartar to make it accessible to our customers but infuse it with Nepali flavours, telling stories about its origins and giving diners a taste of my homeland.What do you think of the prospects of Nepali cuisine abroad?I’m on a mission to share Nepali food worldwide. I have served up dishes like chatamari and lamb sekuwa in my restaurant. But I’m still learning and want to explore more of Nepal’s cuisines. My big dream? To make Nepali cuisine reach more places because it’s got something special that can wow taste buds everywhere.How do you see the changes in restaurants in Nepal?The restaurant industry has deep roots in community and bringing people together, dating back centuries. While this core idea remains, modern restaurants have evolved, making changes to adapt to the times.Yet, in Nepal, despite the growing number of restaurants, many lack uniqueness and storytelling, focusing more on making money than fostering a sense of community.I’ve noticed a troubling trend of rising prices, especially for beloved dishes like momos, which makes people question if they're getting value for their money. It seems like profits are taking precedence over creating genuine, authentic culinary experiences.The industry is starting to lose the creativity and passion that once made it special. It might be time for chefs to shake things up, challenge the norm and bring fresh ideas to the table, revitalising the culinary scene with renewed energy and creativity.What challenges have you faced in New York as an outsider?Living in a bustling city like New York as an outsider has its challenges. But, this city is also full of opportunities for those who are passionate. If you stay true to your culture and want to share your story, opportunities are waiting for you.Even though it can be daunting because of the tough competition, the city appreciates determination and expertise. When I started my journey here, all I wanted to do was cook, eat and share the story of Nepal and its diverse cultures. Instead of focusing on the difficulties, I embraced the chance to follow my passion.What do you think about the criticism of blending Nepali food with modern culinary styles?Chefs care about their food—it’s like they’re sharing a story. They’ve put in a lot of effort to become skilled, so let them be creative. It’s okay to give helpful advice but don’t be mean just to criticise. Chefs shouldn’t also just copy what’s popular, they should cook what they truly love. That’s what makes food special and meaningful.Mishra’s signature dish:Confit Duck Chatamari A traditional Nepali delicacy with French influence.Ingredients:Duck (Legs and breast)Rice (soaked overnight)MayonnaiseWhole spices (cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, bay leaf)Red onionGarlicGingerMula ko achar (Fermented radish)ScallionsLemon juiceNepali pepperVinegarSaltSugarProcedure:For the Duck:Season duck with salt and pepper.Cook in a covered pan with whole spices, garlic, and ginger at low heat for 2 hours on a stove (270 degrees in the oven)Increase heat to crisp up the skin (approximately 15 minutes).Shred the duck meat.Confit Garlic Aioli:Mash cooked garlic and ginger and mix with mayonnaise, lemon juice, Nepali pepper and fermented radishes.Pickled Onions:Slice onions and cook in a mixture of vinegar, water, salt, sugar, and whole spices until softened (about 10 minutes).For the chatamari:Blend soaked rice to make a batter, let it ferment for 6 hours, and adjust consistency with water.Assembling:Cook chatamari batter in duck fat for 4 minutes.Top with shredded duck, aioli, pickled onions and scallions.Serve \nCeleus Baral exudes a serene aura when you meet her, and when she tells you she bakes, it makes sense.

The vegetable is relatively cheap and used in almost all cuisines and curries. This ubiquity could perhaps be why someone might be snubbingly called an ‘aloo’ in Nepal, but the reference does not make potatoes less important.Why have them With zero fat, potatoes contain many important nutrients—vitamins B1, B6, Vitamin C, which is an antioxidant, minerals and fibre. Along with starch, it is a good source of potassium, copper, vitamin C, manganese, phosphorus, niacin, dietary fibre and pantothenic acid. Potassium derived from potatoes is an electrolyte that benefits the heart, muscles and nervous system. Potato skin contains fibre, which is important for digestive health.Compared to other vegetables, potatoes are more energy-dense. It is free of fat, gluten, cholesterol and sodium. The relatively cheap plant-based food is also a good source of carbohydrates. Filled with nutrients, one can get a lot of them by consuming potatoes.Sourcing of potatoesPotatoes thrive in diverse climatic conditions. The country cultivates potatoes on around 200,000 hectares of land—from the plains of Tarai to the mountainous region.Every year, Nepal churns out around 3,410,000 tons of the stuff. It also imports potatoes and potato products worth Rs 8.71 billion.“These imports include potato chips, frozen potatoes and fresh potatoes,” said Biswas Poudel, a senior technical officer at the National Potato Research Programme.As its cultivation is possible in diverse landscapes, even climate change does not affect potato farming, experts say. Types of potatoesRed and white potatoes are popular and widely available in the country. Lately, dark potatoes or blue potatoes are gaining popularity.“Red potatoes are highly popular,” said Poudel. “Potatoes that come in colour contain more nutrients. Darker potatoes are packed with antioxidants.”Potatoes that taste sweet are a good source of vitamin A, an important nutrient for immunity and eye health. Purple potatoes are rich in antioxidants, including anthocyanins that may prevent heart disease and cancer and boost brain health.Other benefits As potatoes contain important nutrients, they benefit human health in multiple ways. Iron, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, and zinc contained in potatoes help the body build and maintain its structure and strength. Consumption of the vegetable that is rich in potassium, calcium and magnesium helps reduce blood pressure naturally. Potatoes also contain a significant amount of fibre, which helps in lowering cholesterol levels in the blood and ultimately lessens the risk of heart disease. Fibre also boosts digestive health.Compared to other green vegetables, farmers use only a minimal amount of pesticides in potatoes, making them safe to eat. Chips and french friesOf late potato chips and french fries are gaining popularity in Nepal. They are also popular dishes in most restaurants and people have even started making french fries at home. Children love potato chips the most. Intake of nutrients and micronutrients, fibre and antioxidants components depends on how potatoes were cooked or prepared for food.Consumption of a lot of chips and french fries can lead to added calories and unhealthy weight gain.“Fibre and antioxidant and other micronutrients of the potatoes may be lost while frying,” said Poudel. “As potatoes are a carbohydrate-rich vegetable, it is not necessary to consume them with rice, which many people do in Nepal.”Experts say diabetic people should limit their potato intake as they cause spikes in blood sugar. \nKhokana, a village near Kathmandu, boasts historical architecture, goat trails to Sikali Temple, mustard oil mills, and the preserved Newari culture with Guthi houses and ponds.\nA filmmaker's journey to Everest Base Camp highlights the importance of preparation, resilience, and the power of embracing the unknown, while emphasizing the fragility of life and the significance of finding meaning and purpose.\nA group of journalists embarked on a 1,000-km tour of Sri Lanka, visiting heritage sites, beaches, and a tea factory, witnessing the island's economic recovery and enduring beauty while learning about its ancient irrigation and cultural significance.\nNepal offers diverse cultural trails like the Mundhum Trek through Kirati villages and religious sites such as Janaki Mandir, scenic destinations like Kuri Village with panoramic Himalayan views, popular treks like the Annapurna Base Camp, wildlife havens like Bardiya National Park with Royal Bengal Tigers, pristine nature in Khaptad National Park, and remote valleys like Limi Valley.\nA nostalgic return to Phidim reveals a transformed hometown marred by departing residents but an influx of pilgrims, marking a transition from rustic charm to urbanized identity.\nNepal National Women's Volleyball team defeated India for the first time in history in the CAVA Women's Volleyball Nations League.\nAt least 91 people were killed and hundreds injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday as police fired tear gas and rubber bullets to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.The death toll, which includes at least 13 policemen, was the highest for a single day from any protests in Bangladesh's recent history, surpassing the 67 deaths reported on July 19 when students took to the streets to demand the scrapping of quotas for government jobs.The government declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. (1200 GMT) on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month. It also announced a three-day general holiday starting from Monday.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is Hasina's biggest test in her 20-year regime after she won a fourth straight term in elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force against protesters, a charge she and her ministers deny.Demonstrators blocked major highways on Sunday as student protesters launched a non-cooperation programme to press for the government's resignation, and violence spread nationwide.“Those who are carrying out violence are not students but terrorists who are out to destabilize the nation,” Hasina said after a national security panel meeting, attended by the chiefs of the army, navy, air force, police, and other agencies.“I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand.”Police stations and ruling party offices were targeted as violence rocked the country of 170 million people.Thirteen policemen were beaten to death in the north-western district of Sirajganj, police said. Nine others were killed in the district, where two lawmakers' homes were set on fire.At least 11 people, including two students and a ruling party leader, were killed and dozens injured amid fierce clashes in several places in the capital, Dhaka, police and witnesses said.India's foreign ministry urged its nationals not to travel to Bangladesh until further notice.BULLET WOUNDSTwo construction workers were killed on their way to work and 30 injured in the central district of Munsiganj, during a three-way clash of protesters, police, and ruling party activists, witnesses said.“They were brought dead to the hospital with bullet wounds,” said Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal, the superintendent of the district hospital.Police said they had not fired any live bullets.In the northeastern district of Pabna, at least three people were killed and 50 injured during a clash between protesters and activists of Hasina's ruling Awami League party, witnesses said.Eight each in Feni and Lakshmipur, six in Narsingdi, five in Rangpur, four in Magura, and the rest in several other districts, hospital officials said.“An attack on a hospital is unacceptable,” said Health Minister Samanta Lal Sen after a group vandalized a medical college hospital and set fire to vehicles, including an ambulance, in Dhaka.At least four garment factories were set on fire in Ashulia, on the outskirts of Dhaka, police said.For the second time during the recent protests, the government shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said. Social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Bangladesh authorities instructed the country’s telecoms providers on Sunday to shut down 4G, effectively disabling internet services, according to a confidential government memo seen by Reuters.“You are requested to shut down all your 4G services until further notice, only 2G will be effective,” said the document issued by the National Telecommunication Monitoring Center, a government intelligence agency.Telecoms companies were previously told their licenses would be cancelled if they did not comply with government orders, a person with direct knowledge told Reuters.The telecom regulatory body did not respond to Reuters' calls.Last month, at least 150 people were killed and thousands injured in violence touched off by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed.“I think the genie is out of the bottle and Hasina may not put it back in the bottle again,” said Shakil Ahmed, associate professor for government and politics at Jahangirnagar University.Chief of Army Staff General Waker-Uz-Zaman on Saturday directed his officers to ensure the security of people's lives, properties, and important state installations under all circumstances, a statement said.“(The) Bangladesh Army is a symbol of the people's trust. The army is always there and will always be there for the people's interests and for any needs of the state,” the statement quoted him as saying.Zaman will brief the media on Monday, an army spokesman said. \nAt least 27 people were killed and scores injured in clashes in Bangladesh on Sunday, as police fired tear gas and lobbed stun grenades to disperse tens of thousands of protesters calling for Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to resign.The interior ministry declared an indefinite nationwide curfew starting at 6 p.m. on Sunday, the first time it has taken such a step during the current protests that began last month.The unrest, which has prompted the government to shut down internet services, is its biggest test since deadly protests erupted after Hasina won a fourth straight term in January elections that were boycotted by the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party.Critics of Hasina, along with human rights groups, have accused her government of using excessive force to stamp out the movement, a charge she and her ministers deny.Demonstrators blocked major highways on Sunday as student protesters launched a non-cooperation program to press for the government's resignation, and violence spread nationwide.“Those who are protesting on the streets right now are not students, but terrorists who are out to destabilise the nation,” Hasina said after a national security panel meeting.“I appeal to our countrymen to suppress these terrorists with a strong hand.”Two construction workers were killed on their way to work and 30 injured in the central district of Munsiganj, during a three-way clash of protesters, police and ruling party activists, witnesses said.“They were brought dead to the hospital with bullet wounds,” said Abu Hena Mohammad Jamal, the superintendent of the district hospital.CLASHESPolice said they had not fired any bullets, however, when some improvised explosives were detonated and the area turned into a battleground.In the northeastern district of Pabna, at least three people were killed and 50 injured during a clash between protesters and activists of Hasina's ruling Awami League, witnesses said.Two more were killed in violence in the northern district of Bogura, and 20 were killed in nine other districts, hospital officials said.“An attack on a hospital is unacceptable,” said Health Minister Samanta Lal Sen after a group vandalised a medical college hospital and set fire to vehicles, including an ambulance, in Dhaka, the capital. “Everyone should refrain from this.”For the second time during the recent protests, the government shut down high-speed internet services, mobile operators said, while social media platforms Facebook and WhatsApp were not available, even via broadband connections.Last month, at least 150 people were killed, thousands injured and about 10,000 arrested in violence touched off by demonstrations led by student groups protesting against quotas for government jobs.The protests paused after the Supreme Court scrapped most quotas, but students returned to the streets in sporadic protests last week, demanding justice for the families of those killed. \nWhat animals did Juddha Shumsher have in his zoo?“We only have records of animals from the mid-1960s,” says Ganesh Koirala, who has been employed at the Central Zoo for the past 36 years and currently serves as its information officer and programme officer. “That too I hand-copied from an old torn-down file that I came across.”Today, the Central Zoo, which sprawls across six hectares in Jawalakhel, Lalitpur, houses as many as 1,298 wild animals of different species of mammals, reptiles, fishes and birds from Nepal and around the world—from tiger, rhinoceros, hippopotamus and red panda to its recent attraction: a pair of chimpanzees.After enduring decades of neglect under various government bodies, with its animals and infrastructure scraping along in a deplorable state, the zoo received a new lease of life with improved infrastructure and animal care in 1995, when it came under the management of the King Mahendra Trust for Nature Conservation (KMTNC), now known as the National Trust for Nature Conservation, in 1995.Today, the Central Zoo is an entertainment venue, one of the most happening places in the Kathmandu valley. Flocked by thousands of daily visitors, the zoo now also hosts rescued animals and those in need of rehabilitation. It is also a site for conservation education.But when Juddha Shumsher Rana (prime minister from 1932–1945) built the Jawalakhel Zoological Garden on the premises of his Jawalakhel Durbar (where Nepal Administrative Staff College stands today) in 1932, he did so purely for private interests—as a space of entertainment and amusement for him and his family.Built in the semi-wilderness of Jawalakhel around a historical pond dating to the 17th century during the reign of King Siddhi Narsingh Malla, the zoo also became the space he could use to show his respect for two women he revered, his mother and sister-in-law, and indulge in one of his favourite pastimes—gambling.Today, the Central Zoo, nestled in the heart of Jawalakhel's sprawling crowd, does not go unnoticed, and its story is well told. But what passions drove Juddha to build the zoo? What was its original layout? What animals did it have in the beginning? And how did Juddha spend time there?“I remember once seeing a small board that read ‘Jawalakhel Zoological Garden’,” Koirala says. “I don’t know whether it was from Juddha’s time or was made in the later years. It must surely be that Juddha built the zoo out of influence from the British given how this term was used by them.”Koirala adds, “There is a former employee, now an elderly gentleman who worked in the zoo in the 1960s. He surely has some stories from Juddha’s time.”Birds, beasts and palacesTo trace the birth of Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, one has to look at the history of Nepal’s rulers owning birds and animals.Like rulers around the world, Nepal’s royalty kept wild and exotic birds and animals in captivity as a source of pleasure and mark of wealth and power. The book ‘Social History of Nepal’ by historians TR Vaidya, Tri Ratna Manandhar and Shankar Lal Joshi details how Mallas during the mediaeval Kathmandu Valley to Ranas and Shahs in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries owned rare, exotic creatures. In 1708, a rhinoceros in Kathmandu Valley broke the iron chain in which it was bound and killed its tamer. In 1714, Bhaktapur’s King Bhupatindra Malla gifted a camel and an elephant to Kantipur’s King Bhaskar Malla to build peace.Among Shahs, King Rana Bahadur Shah in particular was reputed for his collection of birds and animals. He also owned a zoo outside his palace in Basantapur Durbar Square, where the Nepal Bank Limited stands in New Road today. The zoo contained “tiger, bear, monkey, elephant, horse, deer… heron, peacock… pigeon, wild dogs, rabbits, rats, mongoose.”Jung Bahadur Rana’s zoo on the premises of his Thapathali Durbar hosted a variety of birds and animals collected during his hunting expeditions as well as those brought from abroad. Jung Bahadur himself used to “supervise and inspect it”. Juddha Shumsher likewise had his own collection of creatures which steadily expanded into a zoological garden. Seeking wilderness in his Jawalakhel DurbarJuddha’s biographer Ishwari Prasad writes in ‘The Life and Times of Maharaja Juddha Shumsher Jung Bahadur Rana’ that between 1933 and 1940, Juddha shot 433 tigers, 33 rhinoceros and 93 leopards. An insatiable big-game hunter, Juddha had a deep fondness for being in the wild and among wild animals, and from this came, according to oral history prevalent among members of Kathmandu’s Rana community including Juddha’s descendants, the desire to own a zoo.Built in 1752, Schönbrunn Zoo in Vienna, the world’s first modern zoo, was already over 100 years old when Juddha was born in 1875. London Zoo opened in 1828 and Alipore Zoological Garden (Kolkata Zoo) in 1875. Nawab Wajid Ali Shah Zoological Garden (Lucknow Zoo) was established in 1921. Juddha’s inspiration, his descendants say, was most likely reinforced by his tours to zoological gardens during his visits to England in 1908 and to different Indian cities.An article titled ‘Central zoo in state of neglect’ published in The Kathmandu Post in 1996 says that Juddha one day “received a pair of leopards as a gift”, cementing his desire to own a zoo. A report ‘Central Zoo Master Plan’ prepared by the KMTNC in 1996 says that Juddha decided to build a zoo in an epiphany when he saw that some animals “including deer, a few rhinos, and some tigers had been collected from the Tarai and kept in Kathmandu” could be put into one compound in the “lonely piece of land with a large 16th [sic] century Malla period Pokhari”.The pond lay still and serene surrounded by green wilderness ever since Patan’s King Siddhi Narsingh Malla built it in the 1600s. On the grounds surrounding this pond, the Newars from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surroundings had their devisthans where, for centuries, they gathered to perform their religious ceremonies during Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra even after this area fell within the Jawalakhel Durbar.For the palace, the ground served as its extended garden along with a horse and elephant stable. Subodh Rana, 69, grandson of Juddha Shumsher, recalled his father Kiran Shumsher telling him that Juddha and his family sometimes also used the scenic grounds for picnics. If there was any spot where Juddha wanted to build a menagerie, it would be around this Pokhari (pond). One day, he called his grandson General Maheshwar Shumsher Rana and deputed him to the task of doing just this.The zoo’s layout—except for the small plots of lands acquired later—that was in place when it came under KMTNC's management was, the present and retired zoo officials believe, mostly the same as it was built by Maheshwar and so offers a peek into how Juddha’s zoo must have been like. Pond in the middle of the ground surrounded by enclosures—the southern bank housing mainly larger animals, and cages for birds positioned on the northern banks.From pigeons to the king of the jungleWhat animals and birds did the enclosures at Juddha’s zoo house?“We cannot tell for sure,” Koirala says.Once it came under government ownership, the zoo was tossed from one institution to the other for lack of interest and knowledge on the right institution to manage it. Amid all this chaos, documents were possibly lost and the zoo has no concrete record about the animals that Juddha must have once taken amusement at, said Koirala.Mukti Narayan Shrestha, 82, a retired secretary of the Nepal government, joined the Central Zoo in 1970 as a veterinarian when many original structures of the zoo were still intact. Shrestha also worked with an elderly khardar who, he says, was employed in the zoo since the time of Juddha and was about to retire when he joined.“In those days where the purpose of menageries was exclusively for exhibition and pleasure with no regard for the welfare and recreation of animals and birds, the cages were tiny and iron-barred,” Shrestha says.Elephant, horses, deer, monkeys, tiger, rhinoceros, clouded leopard, red panda, bear, palm civet (nir biralo), four-horned antelope, Himalayan goral, pheasants, Himalayan monal—from the mythical and the majestic, the gentle and friendly to the fiery and ferocious, Juddha’s zoo boasted them all, Shrestha says.Shrestha’s account is not different from the anecdotes passed down to other retired and present zoo officials and the members of the Rana community, who also detail the rare and the exotic fauna, like the gharial crocodile and porcupine, even the jungle’s king—creatures, they say, that Juddha must have received from foreigners as gifts—appearing alongside domestic birds like pigeons.Tidbits of published information also confirm that the zoo had a good collection of exotic birds and animals from Nepal and abroad. One such suggestion comes from Kalyan Shumsher’s ‘Shree Teen Juddha Mahima’ published during Juddha’s reign in 1943.“One need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries,” he writes. “It will suffice to see [those creatures] right here in the zoo opened by His Holiness Shree 3 [Juddha] in Jawalakhel.”Among these incredible creatures, one reigned supreme—lion, the king of the jungle.For one, it would not have satiated Juddha to build a zoo and not have the jungle’s king exhibited in it. Juddha hence must have done everything possible to ensure one for the zoo. Infrastructure at the zoo suggests that the lion indeed lived at Juddha’s zoo or, in the least, during the Rana regime.“Where bear habitat lies today, there were two dome-shaped attached enclosures with a holding room, constructed in the classic architecture that many enclosures in the British zoos had in the past. They had brick walls and lime plaster,” Koirala says. “These were built to house a lion in one cage and a tiger in the other.”Near these enclosures stood another cage that remains intact today, with the head of a roaring lion carved out of the wall on the top of its iron bars. Zoo officials as well as members of the Rana community believe that Juddha had this exhibit built to specifically house a lion.Remarkably, these Juddha-era infrastructural spaces are corroborated by a rare piece of photographic evidence. A 1946 photo of the zoo shows a lion while a Kathmandu mother and her sons stand in front of its cage.Juddha’s place of piety and playThe zoo was not merely a space that Juddha sought out for amusement and retreat in the outpost of his palace; he also used this place to express his deepest affection.This affection spills right at the zoo’s entrance, in the form of the life-size statue of Karma Kumari Devi, wife of Juddha’s elder brother and Rana Prime Minister Dev Shumsher. Karma Kumari stands tall in her regal costume shaded by a wide canopy. Juddha revered Karma Kumari because it was she who raised him and looked after his mother Juhar Kumari Devi after the death of his father Dhir Shumsher. On another prominent part of the zoo on the south-east, Juhar Kumari’s enthroned statue overlooks the pond. Juddha had commissioned the London-based sculptor Domenico Antonio Tonelli to cast these statues.When Karma Kumari’s statue was unveiled is not clear, but Juhar Kumari’s statue was unveiled by Juddha amid a grand function in 1935 on Jawalakhel’s most auspicious day, Bhoto Jatra. It was attended by the British Resident Frederick Bailey.“On June 28, 1935, at Jawalakhel Durbar… the pond nearby looked very scenic,” says a Gorkhapatra news report titled ‘Statue installation’ dated July 5, 1935. “Because it was the day of Bhoto Jatra of Machhindranath… and moreover since an ideal woman’s statue was being unveiled, there was a crowd of lakhs of people.”Less than fifty metres from Karma Kumari’s statue stands a one-story building with a pagoda roof that today serves as the zoo’s meeting hall. Juddha, an avid gambler, found the scenic semi-wilderness covered in trees and filled with the sounds of wildlife to be a perfect place to relish the game. So he built a building with twelve doors on its four sides allowing him and his fellow gambling compatriots the freedom to enter through a particular door that they thought would bring luck. He called it his Juwa Ghar, the gambling house, and built it with the sole purpose of indulging in the game he loved. Roar of lion reverberates in KathmanduThe sounds of the animals and birds in the zoo rose up in the Jawalakhel sky. Every day, until much later in the 1970s, roar of the zoo’s lion (there were later other lions) diffused to far corners of the Valley, merging the zoo with the spirit of Kathmandu and informing the city folks of its presence.But was the zoo open to the public as well?“I think once it was built, the zoo was open for the public,” Subodh Rana said. “It is unlikely that Juddha Shumsher built such a large zoo and kept it only for his family.”For one, Kalyan Shumsher mentioning that one “need not travel abroad to see the incredible birds and animals found in foreign countries” suggests that the public had at least some access to the zoo. Of course, the Newar community from Na:Tole, Pulchowk and surrounding areas were permitted inside the zoo on the days of their guthi functions on Basanta Panchami and Bhoto Jatra.As the zoo was established at the back of the ground where Bhoto Jatra celebrations happen, it naturally filled with revellers on this day in addition to the guthi ritual observers as testified by the Gorkhapatra report. The photo of the mother and her sons also bear testimony that the zoo was not entirely closed to the public.What is widely believed, though, is that the zoo officially came under government ownership after Nepal became a democracy in 1951. And it would still be a few more years before it was open to the public in 1956.In 1945, Juddha gave up his power and eventually retired in Dehradun, India, where he died in 1952. With time, Jawalakhel Zoological Garden became the Central Zoo. It would take many avatars—a neglected site of crammed, unmaintained cages with sad eyes of emaciated creatures staring from behind the bars, a focal point of animal diplomacy, particularly during the period of monarchy, to, in its recent decades, a space of conservation and education.When all this was happening, the city sprawled around Jawalakhel, subduing the lion’s roar with its noise. More wildlife from around the country and the world came—creatures captured from the wild, those sold by circuses, those rescued from traffickers. Fate would bring these creatures to the care of generations of Kathmandu folks, intertwining each other’s joys and sorrows. After the tale of Juddha’s Jawalakhel Zoological Garden, there would be these stories to tell. Sitting around a table inside Juddha’s Juwa Ghar, Koirala and other zoo officials begin unfolding these stories before me. \nNepal’s book market is no stranger to the popular Bangladeshi-Swedish writer Taslima Nasrin. Almost all of her books have been translated into Nepali, but Nasrin herself says that they are all unauthorised translations. “All books [Nepali translations] are pirated versions,” Nasrin told the Post in a Whatsapp conversation. Nasrin, who is currently in exile in India after facing death threats in Bangladesh following the publication of her novel Lajja (Shame), said that she or her publishers have never allowed anyone the right to translate her books into Nepali. “I don’t know of any such Nepali publishers. No one asked for permission and no one has paid [me] royalty.”Translating and publishing books without permission from authors or publishers is a punishable crime. But Nepal’s book market is full of such unauthorised translations and prints of books written by the who’s who of the world literature. Such endeavours haven’t just hurt the authors but also the readers, says Ajit Baral, publisher of the Kathmandu-based Fineprint publication. “These translations are poor,” Baral says. “Tomes with 1200–1300 pages have been trimmed to 200–300 pages. An example is the biography of Bill Clinton.”Another popular book that has seen unauthorised Nepali translation is the biography of Steve Jobs by Walter Isaacson.“We have no official deal in place for a [Nepali] translation of Steve Jobs,” Peppa Mignone, associate agent of the CAA, the translation authority of the biography, said in an email interview with the Post.The book’s Nepali translation is published by Panchpokhari Publication House. The translated book identifies the translator thus: “Achyut Koirala, who has a master’s in English literature, is primarily a journalist. He is currently affiliated with Nagarik daily. He keeps a close tab on international history, politics and culture and has written scripts and dialogues for half a dozen Nepali films. He has published over a dozen non-fiction books.”Koirala, who admits to the unauthorised translation, claims that he hasn’t just translated the book but has also done ‘creative writing’ with it.‘Rich Dad Poor Dad’, written by Robert Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter, is among the books that’s perennially on the bestseller list across the world. Upon investigation, the Post found three Nepali translations of the book—all unauthorised. One of them is translated by Dilip Kumar Shrestha and published by the same firm, the Panchpokhari Publication House. Another Nepali iteration of the book is published by Book For All publication and translated by Kopila MD. Yet another Nepali version is translated by one Sudheer Dixit and published by Plata Publication, Kathmandu.In an email conversation with the Post, Ronson Taylor, who oversees the international rights at The Rich Dad Company, said, “At this point in time, we do not have a relationship with an established publisher in the [Nepali] language market. If there are any Rich Dad Poor Dad books currently for sale in the Nepali market, they are pirated.”Basanta Thapa, a writer and translator, says that many books are being translated of late to make easy money. “But how would the quality of these unauthorised translations be!” Thapa wonders. “Readers who haven’t read the original wouldn’t know the faults in the translated versions.” Thapa says that any translator worth his salt aims to ‘recreate’ a book and it takes much work to do that.Taslima’s books are the major victimsTaslima’s memoir Uttal Hawa has been translated into Nepali as ‘Sangharsha’, literally Struggle, and is published by Khoji Publication House. Even though the book in its cover claims that it is an authorised translation from the English version Wild Wind, it is a pirated one. The book is translated by Bikash Basnet and edited by Bhogiraj Chamling. A revised version of the book is edited by Sangeet Srota (Yam Bahadur Chhetri).The same publication house has also published the Nepali translation of the book’s sequel as ‘Prem ra Jeevan’. Publisher Sushil Chalise says that while he is aware that one needs to receive permission from the author or the publisher to translate a book, his efforts to contact Taslima were unsuccessful. Therefore, he had published the version the translator made available to him. Translator Basnet, too, admits he translated the book without Taslima’s permission. “About a decade back, we didn’t know how to ask for permission,” he said.Nepal has the Copyright Act (2002) in place. Before it, there was the The Patent, Design and Trade Mark Act, 2022 (1965) that included intellectual property in its 2006 revision. Even the Muluki Ain (Civil Code) of 1910 BS had a provision about copyright. Moreover, it goes without saying that translating somebody else’s work without permission is immoral.Likewise, Indigo Ink Pvt Ltd has published a Nepali translation of Taslima’s anthology of essays No Country for Women as ‘Aaimai ko Kunai Desh Chhaina’. The book is translated by Krishna Giri and edited by Pramod Pradhan. “I have no idea about the agreement between the publisher and translator,” Pradhan, who is also a children’s book writer, says. “I just copy-edited it upon request.”Bishnukumar Poudel, publisher of Indigo Ink, however, claims that he is still trying to take translation rights for the book. “We translated the book long ago,” he says. “We are still trying to get translation rights.”Indigo is also publishing unauthorised translations under its imprints All Book Store Pvt Ltd, Book for All and Plata Publication. It has published two versions of Rich Dad Poor Dad under those shadow imprints. But Plata Publication is not registered in the Company Registrar’s Office.Pradhan says that many foreign books have had unauthorised translations in Nepali and their quality is poor. Those books are translated not from the original language but from a second or third language, so these translations are bound to have problems, he says. “After I learned that those were unauthorised translations, I have stopped editing them,” Pradhan said.Indian author Shiv Khera’s You Can Win has been translated into Nepali by Bloomsbury India and has granted the distribution rights to Ekta Books. But the book’s unauthorised translations are also found in the market and they don’t even mention the name of the publisher and translator. What is interesting is they mention that it’d be illegal to republish the book, or an excerpt of it, without the author’s permission.The Nepali translation of the book, which was poorly written and rife with inaccuracies, had landed the publisher at court. After a complaint was filed at the District Court Kathmandu in 2066BS on the charge that the publisher violated the copyrights and economic rights, the court had issued a verdict on Mangsir 11 that year, charging a fine of Rs10,000, Rs20,000 and Rs30,000 to the defendants Netra Prasad Pokharel, Narayan Prasad Bhusal, and Bhagwati Risal and Bishnu Silwal, respectively.Baral, the Fineprint publisher, says that international publishers wouldn’t demand much for translation rights given Nepal’s small market, but Nepali publishers do not bother to reach out to them. “Publishers who put out unauthorised translations and sell them at 50 percent discount have troubled publishers like us,” he said.Fineprint has published authorised translated versions of books such as Leaving Microsoft to Change the World by John Wood, Healed by Manisha Koirala, and Hippie by Paulo Coelho. The publication house is also set to release the Nepali translation of Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari’s bestseller Sapiens. Translated into Nepali by Dinesh Kafle, the book’s translation right was acquired at the cost of USD1300, Baral said. Likewise, the publication acquired the translation rights of Sadhguru’s Inner Engineering at IRS93,000, he added.Baral says that publication of unauthorised translations is an immoral and illegal work. “This phenomenon not just hampers Nepal’s fledgling book publishing industry but also tarnishes the country’s reputation in the global market,” Baral said.Thapa, the writer and translator, points out the lack of regulatory mechanisms in the country. “We don’t have an agency that regulates the quality of translations being done,” he says. “Nobody compares the translation with the original. We need a dedicated authority to enhance the quality of translation.” Universities, Nepal Academy and other stakeholders can play a role to uplift the translation sector, he adds.One’s pain, another’s pleasureWhen the author Suketu Mehta was travelling through Mumbai, a young man approached him with a handful of books while his vehicle was stuck in traffic. Brandishing Maximum City, written by none other than Mehta himself, the young man requested the author to buy a copy. Suketu leafed through the book and said, “This is a pirated copy and I’m the author of this book.” The youth wasn’t bothered and replied, “Okay, you can buy it at a discount.”This anecdote was shared to the Post by Mehta’s friend, the author and professor Amitava Kumar, in an email exchange.Most of these pirated books are imported into Nepal from India while the retailers of original books are finding themselves increasingly in trouble. “We sell original copies but many readers doubt us as well, given the ubiquity of pirated versions,” says Anjan Shrestha, operator of Education Book House, Jamal.Ramchandra Timothy, chair of Thapathali-based Ekta Books Pvt Ltd, said that the phenomenon of piracy has tarnished Nepal’s image internationally. “There was a time when Bangladesh would be known as ‘piracy king’,” he said. “Now there's a risk Nepal would take the crown.”As tax increases, so does piracyThe government decision to impose a 10 percent tax on book imports in fiscal year 2019-20 led to a proliferation of pirated book markets, booksellers say. After the decision, booksellers started to cut back on imports and that led to the entry of a new crop of pirated booksellers, a trader in Kathmandu says. But following widespread backlash, then finance minister Bishnu Paudel struck down the policy.“After the government’s decision, we stopped importing books for a while,” says Shrestha of Education Books. “The import of books went down for about two years. Then the pirates stepped in to fill the gap. It was about that time that pirated copies of biographies and memoirs of Obamas and Jai Shettys became omnipresent in the market.”Pirated copies of classics by Roald Dahl and JK Rowling also made an entry in the Nepali market. Then the phenomenon only saw a rise.Since the customs department does not levy duty on foreign books and also does not care to differentiate between the pirated and original copies, unauthorised books have found a safe haven in Nepali market.The government doesn’t levy any customs duty on books and newspapers published by foreign publishers abroad. The importers should only pay Rs565 at the customs points. But Nepali publishers have to pay 10 percent tax to import books printed in India.James Taylor, director of Communications and Freedom to Publish of the International Publishers Association, says that the government, publishers, writers and readers should join hands to control widespread piracy. “The government should realise that book publishing and reading culture contribute to the country’s economy as well,” he said, adding that the government should seize pirated books and close websites that sell pirated ebooks.Nandan Jha, executive vice chair of Penguin Random House India’s sales, production and business department, says that piracy has emerged as a big challenge for publishers of late and has harmed the authors, publishers, distributors, printers, readers and other stakeholders. “To confront piracy, all the stakeholders should launch a special joint effort,” Jha told the Post in an email exchange.Piracy has proliferated in the Nepali market to such an extent that the publishers of such books and unauthorised translations keep whatever ISBN numbers they like, often conflicting with other books, and still get off scot free. If scanned or searched on the internet, the ISBN number gives details on the author of the book, what the book is about, and its price, among others.Bijay Sharma, information officer at TU Library, says, “Keeping ISBN number at one’s will is illegal. If anyone files a complaint, we can punish them.”By the lawThe Muluki Ain-1910 BS had mandated that a publisher take permission of Gorkha Bhasa Prakashini Samiti before publishing any material. The Copyrights Act came into effect in 2022 BS and was amended in 2054 BS. In 2059 BS, a new Act was promulgated and it is still effective now. Authorities are currently working to amend the Act to give the registrar’s office more autonomy regarding copyright.According to the 2059 BS Act, copyright violations are considered government cases. In such cases, plaintiffs should file a complaint with the police. The Act’s clause 25 has various conditions that amount to violation of copyright. The Act’s subclause A says that if a publisher produces or copies material in writing or sound and sells or distributes it, it amounts to violation of copyright.Likewise, the Act’s clause 26 prevents selling of unauthorised material. The clause restricts the ‘importation of copies of work or sound recording, either made in a foreign country or sourced otherwise, into Nepal for business purpose shall not be permitted if preparation of such copies would be considered illegal if they were prepared in Nepal.’If anyone infringes upon protected rights, they are liable to punishment but the provision’s implementation remains lax.The law gives the authority to district court to take legal action against copyright violators.Advocate Parshuram Koirala says that if the government becomes more proactive, it can punish violators on the basis of the 2059 BS Act and thereby control the phenomenon of intellectual theft and copyright violations. “Creation is a crucial part of humanity’s benefit,” he says. “If intellectual property is not protected effectively, then there’d be no inspiration to create something.”Bal Bahadur Mukhiya, a professor at Nepal Law Campus, suggests the inclusion of rules about digital piracy in law, and also the clauses of various related international treaties and agreements that Nepal is part of.“In the US, a teacher or professor should pay a certain revenue even to photocopy a chapter of some text for teaching purposes,” Mukhiya says. “But in Nepal, those who photocopy an entire book and sell it go scot free.”(This report is prepared in collaboration with the Centre for Investigative Journalism, Nepal.) \nBharat Budha, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality’s ward 10, knows that many youths from his village have made it to the United States via ‘tallo bato’—backdoor route—and that many are still on the way. He also knows that eight of them have been deported from the country and that they have lost a cumulative Rs45 million in the process. The deported youths say that they returned home empty-handed after facing unspeakable ordeals and lost Rs6 million each on average.The Tak village in Rukum East—a close-knit settlement of 425 houses—was considered the Maoists’ ‘base area’ during the insurgency. Village youths who reached the US through illegal routes and got deported have lost an estimated Rs40 million. The number of those who returned without completing the journey and the amount they lost remain unknown.To get to the US, the youths have taken loans at up to 36 percent interest per annum from their relatives and village landowners. In Tak village, at least one person each from half of the households has gone abroad, Budha said. “Youths started going to America about six-seven years ago,” he said. “If they could gather enough money, the whole village would try to go to the US.” Budha’s own son had reached the US illegally in 2017, spending Rs3.2 million.During the insurgency, outsize slogans of revolution would adorn the walls of houses in the village. Hoping for a better life, people from all walks of life helped out the Maoists. But now, village youths are paying the agents to illegally get to the US—a country that the Maoists used to call their ‘enemy’, an ‘imperialistic force’. This has cost the Tak village much and in multiple ways.Death of a dreamSome of the deported youths have chosen to flee the village altogether, burdened with debt and creditors’ pressure. At least five such families have already left, said a resident. The family of Ram Budha was one of them. On April 28, 2015, Ram, who had returned to Nepal after working in Malaysia for eight years, took the illegal route to the US. He travelled through arduous trails for months and finally arrived in the country. Upon reaching the country, he was detained and had to stay at the detention camp for 27 months. When his refugee application was rejected, he was deported to Nepal in mid-December 2019. He lost Rs4.5 million in the process. He now owes over Rs6 million to creditors. “After the creditors began to put pressure on me, I couldn’t live in the village peacefully,” said Ram, who currently runs a vegetable farm in Tarakeshwar, Kathmandu.While those who got to the US through illegal routes and fortunately got refugee status there narrate their stories with pride, those who have been deported or returned from half-way have tragic tales to tell.Nanda Kala Gharti, who lives in a small stone house on the upper flank of Tak village, spends her days in melancholy. Her husband, Dhanlal, had chosen to take the illegal route to the US, and Nanda Kala, a mother of four, is living with the repercussions of his decision. Dhanlal had got into the US after a six-month long arduous journey and was detained immediately. He had to spend four years in the detention camp, before he was deported to Nepal. He had already lost Rs6 million.Nanda Kala said they now have an insurmountable crisis in their hands. Pointing to her son, she exclaimed, “When will he grow up, go abroad and pay back the loans!”Dhanlal himself tried to go to Croatia once and spent 15 days in Kathmandu for the process. But after he was turned down, he returned home dejected. “Now we will submit the passport to another agent [for Dhanlal’s trip abroad],” Nanda Kala said. “There’s no point staying here.”Stories that echo each otherThe situation in Sisne Rural Municipality is similar to that of Putha Uttarganga. Here, one can hear plenty of stories of those who have tried to go to the US and those who are fighting refugee cases there. Krishna Regmi, chair of the rural municipality, personally knows seven people who have been deported from the US.Gangaram Khadka, a resident of Sisne-3, runs a bee and chicken farm. Like other young men in his village, Khadka had headed off to the US via an illegal route on 27 March, 2018. He had reached the US via the New Delhi-Moscow-Barcelona-Bogota-Panama-Costa Rica-Nicaragua-Honduras-Guatemala-Mexico route. When he finally arrived in the US, he was detained and had to spend 11 months in detention. He was deported on 15 March, 2019. He had handed over Rs3.2 millions to the agent and spent Rs2 million to fight the case to become a refugee. “It’s not possible for me to pay back the loan while working in Nepal,” he said. “I aim to pay back some interest and head off abroad again.”For six months after Khadka was deported, he had anxiety and headache, he said, adding the three people from his village who were deported like him are also struggling with their mental health.Tikaram Pun, a 40-year-old resident of Bohora village in Musikot-4, is also haunted by his past journey. In September 2017, he reached the US after crossing 17 countries with the help of organised human traffickers. Of the 41 people in his group, 31 were from Rukum East and Rukum West, he said. Pun, who was detained on arrival in the US, spent 24 months in a detention camp. His refugee application was also refused and so he was deported along with eight other Nepalis. “When I returned, I started having mental health problems. I still suffer from them,” he said. Pun is under pressure from creditors and relatives to pay back the Rs9.2 million loan he had taken for the task.Those who died on the wayA group of 10 Bangladeshis and seven Nepalis, including Rupak Bohora of Bafikot-3 in Rukum West, were on a mission to reach Costa Rica through Colombia, Caribbean Coast, Capuragana and Panama. But while they were crossing a sea, their boat capsized. As many as 12 died in the incident, including six Nepalis. Rupak’s wife, Geeta, learned about the incident only after six days, on 25 June, 2021.“I still don’t know what exactly happened,” said Geeta, who had been married off at age 19 and is now a mother of two daughters. The only thing she knows is that Rupak has died and she is now all alone. And that she has Rs5 million in loan taken for Rupak’s trip. She showed a picture of her husband on her phone to this scribe and said, “I only have memories.”Lack of political will and legal remediesThe concrete bridge over Chewang river is on the edge of Tak village. On the walls of the bridge are paintings of political theorists like Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin and Mao, and the iconic slogan, ‘Workers of the world, unite!’, below them. But the slogan appears to be at odds with life in the village. Given the phenomenon of illegal travels to the US through the help of organised human traffickers, the whole village appears to be emptying. Neither the local governments are concerned about the phenomenon nor are the political parties paying attention.Puniraj Gharti, chair of Putha Uttarganga Rural Municipality, said though the trend is worrying, there’s nothing he can do. “How could we stop them from making the trip when they are struggling to make a living in the village?” he said.Krishna Regmi, chair of Sisne Rural Municipality, said that the vicious cycle of poverty started after marijuana farming was banned in the country. Then the Maoist insurgency added to the woe, forcing youths to migrate. The signing of the peace agreement in 2006 didn’t herald any change in the economy either and youths are struggling to get jobs. Organised human traffickers are cashing in on this sorry state of affairs, Regmi said. “Meter byajis [usurious lenders] are also promoting this phenomenon,” he added.The phenomenon is equally rife in Dang’s Tulsipur and Ghorahi. Ramesh Kumar Pandey, chair of Ghorai-15, says that even though many heading to the US are swindled, no complaints are filed at the ward office. “Only those who attempt to go to Saudi Arabia or Qatar file the complaints,” he said.One can infer from Pandey’s statements that the families of such illegal travellers don’t want to publicise the ordeals of their family members. On the one hand, agents threaten them to not publicise the issue; on the other, they fear they themselves would be punished by law.According to the Anti-Human Trafficking Bureau, as many as 178 Nepalis, including 174 men, have been deported from the US in the five fiscal years after 2018-19. Of them, the highest 49 are from Rukum while 37 are from Dang. The data doesn’t include those who returned after making it to the half-way or those who have been fighting the legal battle in the US for refugee status. But this data is enough to show that many such youths are from the ‘base areas’ of the Maoist insurgency.SSP Jeevan Shrestha, chief of the bureau, said that data on the number of such victims and the amounts they have spent is hard to collect since complaints are rarely filed with the police. “This is human trafficking but for a lack of law, we are still compelled to launch the cases as per Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act 2074 BS,” Shrestha said. “The Act provides a maximum penalty of Rs250,000 for the offenders and 50 percent of that as compensation to the victims.” Without specific law, police also invoke the theft and organised crime act to punish the offenders, he added.On the one hand, police receive no complaints; on the other, the phenomenon sees no control.Bhaskar Gautam, a political scientist, says the rise in cases of human trafficking in the insurgency’s ‘base areas’ is due to the political system’s abject failure.While the Maoists raised issues related to livelihood, nationalism and a new kind of democracy to fuel their war machine, after the peace process, it is livelihoods that have been hit the hardest, Gautam said. “The traditional way of life and economy took a hit during the insurgency,” he said. “Developments after the peace process also failed to address that. What sprang up was organised human trafficking.”(Mahesh KC in Rukum East and Durgalal KC in Dang contributed to this report.)This report is prepared in collaboration with the Center for Investigative Journalism-Nepal. \nHumans have gambled throughout history. It is one of the oldest activities that people across the world, irrespective of how advanced and sophisticated their social and cultural histories are, have engaged in and clung to. Indeed, gambling has been so pervasive in the human consciousness that it has assumed precision and advancement, including its harnessing by technology.Gambling was prevalent in ancient India, China, Rome, Egypt, Peru and Japan. Late 19th century historians found evidence of “gaming tables engraved or scratched on the marble or stone slabs, for the amusement of idle men, always ready to cheat each other out of their money” in ancient Rome. Over time, the acceptance of gambling varied from culture to culture.In the ancient Indian epic, Mahabharata, the reference to the game of the dice was central to the unmaking of a princely clan which put everything—including their kingdom and their queen—at stake. It is a prime instance of gambling’s so-called immorality and the social and economic harm that it can cause.Gambling is essentially a game of chance or hazard. While in the past it was viewed as recreation and entertainment—it remains so across many countries—more recent scholarly studies increasingly view the motives for gambling as highly complex. At the same time, problem or pathological gambling is seen as an addiction and, therefore, a mental health problem, with socially and financially destructive consequences.So culturally embedded gambling has been in India that card games, with money on stake, is a routine feature in households celebrating the goddess of wealth, Lakshmi, during Diwali, the festival lights. Crude gambling games such as teen patti and matka continue to be played in India’s crowded megacities even as online gambling sites and betting apps have boomed with the penetration of technology. A recent study found that the illegal betting market receives as much as $US100 billion in annual deposits.In India, betting and gambling are strictly prohibited under the Public Gambling Act, and are considered illegal across most regions. However, successive Indian central governments have taken little interest in enforcing a blanket ban with the only legal forms of gambling being state-run lotteries, horse racing, rummy card games and casinos.More recently, the Indian Central Consumer Protection Authority issued an advisory prohibiting advertising, promotion and endorsement of unlawful activities. With this, the authority sought to caution that advertisements or endorsements of activities otherwise prohibited by law shall be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. It warned that any violation of the guidelines would invite “stringent measures”.In the West, the mental health consequences of gambling have been extensively studied, but the subject has not been a focus of interest for researchers in India even as compulsive betting in cricket matches (since the early 1990s) and now the proliferation of online betting micro-sites and apps indicate. It is generally accepted that a “bad beat”—significant financial loss at gambling—acts as a “catalyst” for a condition known as problem gambling. Several consecutive losses can “disorient perceptions” and lead to a continuing pattern of financial setbacks which, in turn, causes mental health disorders, including substance abuse, anxiety and depression, that need prolonged psychiatric and other treatments.The permissiveness of gambling varies from country to country. Each country can address the issue of gambling in general, and problem or compulsive gambling in particular, from their own cultural perspectives. On a general plane, experts suggest greater legislation and funding is needed on prevention, awareness, treatment and research, particularly in India. Government, private and charitable efforts to mitigate the mental health impact of gambling need to be more responsible. More importantly, instead of dismissing or challenging research findings, online gaming industry members can address the problem of gambling with more coordinated efforts.-360info \nEvery time someone mentions “business plan,” I think about two of the major projects of my life—the discussion series run by Martin Chautari and the academic journal Studies in Nepali History and Society (SINHAS). When I was involved in expanding the work of the mangalbare discussion group of Chautari and in founding SINHAS, both in 1995, no one asked me what the business plans for these projects were. If anyone had asked, I would have had to tell them they did not exist. And if the existence of such plans were a prerequisite for these projects, they would have never taken off to become important platforms for public discourse and academic publications related to Nepal. I wrote about the discussion series in an earlier column of the Post (“Chautari guff at 32”, November 10, 2023).The idea of SINHAS emanated from a spontaneous proposal made by our publisher, Madhab Lal Maharjan, to me when I was visiting his shop, Mandala Book Point, some day in 1994. I made no immediate commitment to him. I returned to the University of Pennsylvania (UPenn) in late 1994 to complete my doctoral dissertation. The final decision to start SINHAS was made in the summer of 1995 following conversations between Mary Des Chene, Mark Liechty and myself in Philadelphia and Baltimore. Lazima Onta-Bhatta was invited to join the team. We decided that each journal volume would consist of two issues—each about 200 pages thick—published in June and December of each year. Then, Madhab and we made a simple oral agreement: The editors would prepare the “camera-ready” copy of each issue, and he would publish, distribute and sell it. The first issue of SINHAS was published in August 1996. A “foolish” decisionReflecting on the decision to start SINHAS, I would say that it represented the collective “foolishness” of the four founding editors. How so?Think about the “standing” of the founding team in 1995: Here were four people, two of whom were early career post-PhD researchers, and the other two doctoral students still writing their dissertations. The most senior of the lot, Mary, had finished her PhD in anthropology from Stanford University in 1991 with a dissertation titled “Relics of Empire: A Cultural History of the Gurkhas, 1815-1987.” She published an article in the Himalayan Research Bulletin in 1992 and a second one in the South Asia Bulletin in 1993. In 1995, apart from teaching, she was crafting articles for other journals and edited volumes. She had published at least two book reviews in academic journals by then, and might have even peer-reviewed a manuscript or two for some journals.The second post-PhD researcher in our team, Mark Liechty, obtained his PhD in anthropology from UPenn in December 1994, writing a dissertation titled “Fashioning Modernity in Kathmandu: Mass Media, Consumer Culture, and the Middle Class in Nepal.” He had spent the first six months of 1995 as a postdoctoral fellow at the International Institute for Asian Studies in Leiden, the Netherlands. While there, he finished the final draft of his article, “Kathmandu as Translocality: Multiple Places in a Nepali Space,” published in 1996 in the edited volume Geography of Identity. Before going to Leiden, Mark finished another article on youth identities and the experience of modernity in Kathmandu, published in 1995 in the edited volume Youth Cultures: A Cross-Cultural Perspective. Hence, by mid-1995, although two of his articles in two separate edited volumes were in various stages of the pre-press process, Mark had not even submitted an article to a journal for review. He published a book review in 1993 but does not remember doing any official peer reviews for any journal until then.In July 1995, I was still a year away from finishing my PhD in history at UPenn. During the hot summer of 1995 in Philadelphia, I was writing my dissertation, “The Politics of Bravery: A History of Nepali Nationalism.” Some months earlier, I had published a full-length article under the title “Rich Possibilities: Notes on Social History in Nepal” in Contributions to Nepalese Studies, which was the most prominent journal of Nepal Studies at that time. That submission had not undergone a rigorous peer review process but was finely copy-edited before publication. By then, I had published reviews of academic books in three journals. Still, I had not done any official peer review of any article manuscript written by others for any journal. In the early summer of 1995, Lazima, the fourth founder of SINHAS, was still doing her anthropological fieldwork in Kathmandu on the subject of street children. At that time, she had not published anything in academic journals. Later that year, she returned to the US to begin writing her doctoral dissertation, which eventually got submitted to Cornell University in 2000 under the title “Street Children’s Subcultures and Cultural Politics of Childhood in Nepal.” So here was a group of four researchers—two early post-doctoral ones and two doctoral students—who had certainly read thousands of journal articles between them during their graduate training but whose collective experience of writing for academic journals was limited to just three published full-length articles in total! Three members of this group had never done an official peer review of any article manuscript submitted to any journal. None of them had worked as a proper editorial assistant in any academic journal team previously. In other disciplinary domains, early career researchers cut their journal editing teeth by working first as junior members of the editorial collective of some journals. Later on, they are offered associate and eventually full editorial positions in those same or other journals. But here was our team, deciding to establish a new journal of Nepal Studies without such experience. Surely, we were well read in Nepali history and society, but collectively, we had minimal knowledge of the intricate processes that generate academic journals. Hence, the decision to establish SINHAS was a “foolish” reflection of the collective youth and naivety of the four founding editors.Portable lessonsGiven its current standing among practitioners of Nepal Studies, I would have to say that SINHAS has done pretty well in its 29 years of existence despite not having a “business plan.” We have learnt to run the journal while securing and editing good articles that enhance our collective understanding of Nepali history and society. That raises this question: Does every project in life need a business plan? I clearly don’t think so. For many aspects of how a democratic society ought to function, we probably need individuals committed long-term to specific ideas and projects more than business plans for them. Such individuals should have the freedom to “foolishly” launch public-serving projects without worrying about business plans. I am glad that back in 1995, I did not have to respond to folks who were married to the idea of business plans for everything, whether a discussion forum or a journal. There should be ample room for spontaneity, public-serving naivety and experiential serendipity in any society that likes to call itself loktantrik.   \nA swollen and roaring Trishuli River swept away two passenger buses on July 12. The fact that the buses and most of the passengers are yet to be found has compounded the tragedy and grief of the families. The failure of rescue groups in this incident indicates that our existing mechanisms and disaster preparedness need to be revised, and the country needs heightened vigilance in the coming days.Right since the accident, the Nepal Police, the Armed Police Force, and the Nepal Army have tirelessly toiled in search and rescue on Simaltal section of the Muglin-Narayanghat road and subsequently in other areas too. However, locating the bus and passengers in the raging river is proving to be as hard as searching for a needle in a haystack. The experienced rescuers from the Indian National Disaster Response Force (NDRF) joined their Nepali counterparts with two magnets weighing 19 kg and 14 kg each and advanced sonar devices but they had to return empty-handed. Officials say they are now mulling over reaching out to its northern neighbour, China, for some help.Nepali rescuers’ efforts are praiseworthy, but they are apparently ill-equipped both in terms of skills and advanced tools for the intended goal. Much time was wasted in the initial days of the Simaltal incident; when the Indian team arrived, it was too late for them to make much difference. While there is nothing wrong in asking for help from our two neighbours, effective disaster management begins at a community or local level. People in the vicinity should be equipped to immediately mobilise after such disasters with the right sets of tools and knowhow. What’s concerning is that such a deadly incident in Trisuli is not isolated. Over the past eight years, as reported in Nepalkhabar, 55 people have gone missing aboard 21 vehicles that plunged into the Trishuli River on the Muglin-Narayanghat road and the Muglin-Mowakhola section of the Prithvi highway. Similarly, six vehicles lost in the past 32 years have never been found. This suggests something is badly amiss in disaster preparedness on our treacherous highways. The monsoon this year has been harsh, and rainfall patterns are ever-changing. Amid this, the authorities have tried to evade their responsibility of building engineeringly sound roads, heeding experts and arranging for right tools for search and rescue. Poor roads and haphazard road construction, in turn, result in landslides. Due to random road construction, and expansion projects that involve bulldozing the cliffs/hills adjoining the roads, the risk of disasters in most of Nepal’s highways continues to be high. Many stretches on the Muglin-Narayanghat Road and Prithvi Highway are in the red zone, and they need proper monitoring and surveillance as well as dedicated human and financial resources to prepare for a disaster that might occur any time of the year. Besides, the government should prioritise upskilling the rescuers in line with the changing weather patterns and disaster types.If the government doesn’t learn from the Simaltal tragedy and plan its disaster preparedness and responses accordingly, no highway or season in Nepal will be safe to travel. The wait-and-see approach and the tendency to swing into action only after the fact will continue to exact a heavy toll in terms of human deaths and injuries. \nThe Parliamentary Hearing Committee on Monday rejected the Constitutional Council’s nomination of Krishna Man Pradhan as election commissioner. Rights bodies, media and common folks had been closely following the committee’s deliberations. They were trying to gauge whether the committee would endorse the nominee who had been accused by a woman of years of sexual exploitation. Appearing before the committee, the woman narrated how Pradhan had sexually abused her and why he was morally unfit to hold a respectable constitutional position. After listening to the woman and interrogating the nominee, the joint panel of the federal parliament finally rejected Pradhan for the position. Of course, you could argue that the panel had it easy as Pradhan had already pulled out of the race to be the commissioner when he realised that the woman had a strong case against him. Yet that would be a simplistic reading. The reason Pradhan pulled out was the intense scrutiny that the parliamentary hearing process had put him under. There are differing views on the relevance of parliamentary hearings in Nepal. The Constitutional Council, which picks the officials for constitutional bodies, is an all-powerful entity headed by the prime minister and comprising Speaker, National Assembly chair, chief justice, leader of the main opposition and deputy speaker. It involves not only heads of executive, legislative and judiciary but also that of the opposition party. So, one argument is that a person picked by such a powerful entity need not again be vetted by a parliamentary committee. But, historically, top leaders in the council are guided mainly by the ethos of political bhagbanda (sharing of seats). Its decisions have often courted controversy. It would often happen that when a member of the council didn’t get to pick those close to them, the member would be absent from the council meeting, thus hindering its functioning. In 2020, when KP Sharma Oli was prime minister during his second term, he even changed the provisions of the Constitutional Council Act, just so he could make over four dozen appointments including heads and members of several constitutional bodies. The decision couldn’t be crosschecked at the hearing committee as Oli had already dissolved the House of Representatives. Lawyers challenged the move in the court but the issue is still sub-judice. It is only in a rare case that the House committee rejects the council’s recommendation. Pradhan’s rejection however is not the first. If the House wasn’t in session, Pradhan’s recommendation would have automatically been passed and he would have by now become an election commissioner. It is because the committee has a system to seek complaints, if any, from the public about the nominee that a victim could reach out to the lawmakers and inform them about his wrongdoings. Thus a wrong man has been stopped from holding an important position. The committee however over the years failed to gain public trust as it is seen as no more than a rubber-stamp of powerful leaders. It should be able to dispel such beliefs by taking more bold decisions. The goal, as some argue, should not be to do away with the parliamentary hearing altogether. It should rather be to make the process so effective that the council would think many times before making questionable recommendations.  \nAsked by a young Nepali woman why more and more students are going abroad for higher studies, the envoy of a country that hosts one of the biggest populations of Nepali students replied: “Young people like to travel.” The ambassador was implying that even if Nepal had a far better education system than it currently does, as well as a decent job market, many young people would still jet off to faraway lands. There is thus no easy way to make young Nepalis stay back in their own country, either to work or to study. The best the country can hope is that at least some of its youths who get a good education or valuable work experience abroad come back and do something worthwhile in their homeland. There are ways to encourage this trend. The national economy needs to grow at a decent clip, putting more disposable income in people’s hands and boosting enterprises and industries. More than that, having policy stability will allow businesses to plan long-term. It’s a virtuous cycle. Yet, even in the best-case scenario, a touch of realism is warranted: There is only so much a developing state like Nepal can do to keep its youth rooted in their country—if such a policy is advisable.Japan seems to be the new destination of choice for Nepali students. In the just-completed fiscal year, over 112,000 students obtained the ‘no objection certificates’ (NOCs) from the Ministry of Education. (Such letters are mandatory for Nepali students to study abroad.) The ministry issued over 34,000 NOCs for Japan, followed by over 15,000 for Canada, over 14,000 for Australia, over 13,000 for the UK, and a touch over 11,000 for the US. The appeal of Japan has been steadily rising as education there is relatively cheaper compared to studying in Western countries and a Nepali student in Japan can work for up to 28 hours a week. Interestingly, the high influx of foreign students has sparked a debate in Japan, traditionally a closed country, on the costs and benefits of accepting migrants of all kinds. Pretty much the same thing is happening in Australia, which has over the past year tightened its rules for foreign students. As Australia tightened its borders, Nepali students seem to have shifted to Japan. So, again, part of the reason Nepali students go abroad is undoubtedly economic. Yet it is far from the whole story. Rather than looking to keep young folks in the country at all costs, the goal could rather be to build a capable network of people of Nepali origin, wherever they are in the world, and harness this collective power for the country’s good. For instance, Nepalis in North America collaborated to push for the Nepal Open University, the distance learning public university established in 2016. As the gig economy takes off and studying online gains popularity, distance learning gives people the flexibility to juggle their study, work and other commitments. The potential for such collaboration is endless, if only the host country creates the right environment. Moreover, even as it is, there is a steady stream of young professionals coming back to Nepal from abroad and setting up their own businesses and ventures. Perhaps the time has come to rethink the whole debate around the ‘brain drain’ from Nepal. \nThe new coalition government, led by Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli, faced a huge public backlash when it appointed only two women and not a single Dalit in the 22-member Council of Ministers. The same government, however, garnered praise in a matter of days when Prime Minister Oli appointed Lila Devi Badtaula as the Nepal government’s first female Chief Secretary. While undeniably historic in a country where men are at the forefront of leadership positions, it is difficult to ignore the political context surrounding Badtaula’s selection, which came amid a public outcry over the severe underrepresentation of women in the Cabinet. Her appointment at the end of her career and only when former chief secretary Baikuntha Aryal was suspended—outgoing Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal had appointed Badtaula an acting chief secretary on July 15—is suggestive of the disregard for having women in top positions when men are around. This raises questions about whether Badtaula’s promotion was no more than a tactical move to quell public discontent. The prime minister, silent about the biases in Cabinet, boasted on Facebook on Saturday, “I saw many friends writing about Nepali women who have reached high leadership positions on social media yesterday. I am also pleased with these four coincidences that became possible under my positive initiative”. The pictures showed the first female President, Bidhya Devi Bhandari; the first female Chief Justice, Sushila Karki; the first woman speaker in the House of Representatives, Onsari Gharti; and Badtaula—all of whom were appointed during Oli’s government leadership at different times. We also have another unforgettable name Sewa Lamsal (the first female foreign secretary), at present. The world is forging ahead towards gender inclusivity, bringing more women to the fore, be it in politics or administration, and Nepal also seems somewhat committed to it. The country has significantly improved women’s political representation, who now occupy 91 seats in the 275-member federal parliament. And apart from politics, as per the Department of National Personnel Records, out of 85,513 civil service employees, 20.64 percent are female; seven are secretaries besides the chief secretary. Even so, genuine gender equality and inclusion is far from ensured. These seemingly “historic” achievements, each carrying the tag “the first woman,” however, fail to represent a whole lot of Nepali women. It is uncertain whether more women will consistently fill the positions left by their ‘female firsts’. As concerning is the exclusion of women from marginalised communities in the top roles, where the Khas-Arya dominate.Things won’t improve much unless more women are elected through first-past-the-post or direct elections—in the 2022 elections just nine women were directly elected—and unless women stopped being played as token cards. And this will never come without political leaders’ willingness to change. As men dominate Nepali politics, women are “given” positions. Tokenism will never lead to women’s empowerment and equality; it will in fact prove detrimental to the realisation of our gender-equal dreams. True gender equality requires more than symbolic gestures; it demands substantive change in our behaviour in how we treat women both at home and in public positions. As of yet, political positions are seen as something that only men can handle, and women are largely sidelined or dismissed. Because of this, not many women aspire to be politicians or top administrators. This structural discrimination against women undermines the constitutional spirit of equality of opportunity for people of all genders and socio-economic backgrounds. Not only is this immoral but also illegal.  \nWithin days of CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli and Nepali Congress President Sher Bahadur Deuba reaching a deal to form a new government under Oli’s leadership, some Congress leaders including the two party general secretaries started doubting the deal’s implementation. Independent observers also have doubts over the longevity of the Congress-UML partnership. To get some insight, the Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal sat down with Congress Central Committee member Govind Raj Pokharel, who is also former vice-chair of National Planning Commission. Many have expressed doubt over the longevity of the Congress-UML alliance. What is your observation?There was a discussion in the political circles on the need for the Congress and the UML joining hands to address some serious problems the country has been facing for years. The issues of governance, flaws seen in the practice of the electoral system, and the national economy are some pressing issues that need to be addressed. In the meantime, the top leaders of the two largest parties reached a deal overnight. The dramatic turn of events made people suspect some unspoken reasons had brought the leaders of the two rival forces together. The leaders have stated that they joined hands mainly to review the constitution, to make changes in the electoral system, improve governance and address problems seen in the economic sector. These are the stated objectives. As far as my observation goes, people don’t have full faith in the leaders of the two parties because of past records. On the economic front, this coalition may achieve some improvements because both parties are on the same page. Both follow liberal economic ideas. Of late, even the UML has become increasingly liberal on economic issues. The private sector has welcomed the new alliance. There are already some signs of reforms. Their plan to make changes in the electoral system through constitutional amendment however is not easy. First, their numerical strength in the federal parliament, mainly in the upper house, is insufficient to amend the constitution. Such a move would be risky from a strategic perspective as well. Many groups and forces have reservations over various provisions of this constitution. Once they start the amendment process, it will be like opening Pandora’s Box. Thus I am optimistic only on the economic front. If they get that right, it will help address the society’s mass frustration.The two parties have cited the perennial political instability as a major reason behind their coming together. Can we now expect policy consistency as well?Political instability is an excuse to cover up their failures. Even the alliance of largest parties cannot guarantee political or policy stability. Numbers alone are not enough. Leaders also need to have a democratic culture and the capacity to manage emerging issues. Even governments led by a single party commanding up to two-thirds majority have failed. On certain occasions, coalition governments have done commendable jobs. Handling the post-quake situation and producing the constitution in 2015 were examples of big parties justifying their coalition. Thus even with some doubt, we can expect political stability and some economic reforms.The Congress unanimously endorsed the deal of party president Sher Bahadur Deuba and CPN-UML chair KP Sharma Oli. But in public, leaders from the anti-establishment faction of the Congress don’t seem satisfied. Why this unease?The deal was made in a dramatic way without proper consultations with other leaders. At least those in the executive committees of the party should have been consulted. It is challenging for the Congress leaders to ally with their major rival, the UML. A cadre-based party, the UML’s style of governance is different to that of the Congress. When in government, the UML treats even government institutions, constitutional bodies and independent agencies as the party’s structures. Whereas the Congress allows more freedom to government agencies. So, there is a risk of the UML misusing state mechanisms while the Congress leaders are in the Cabinet. This is one big risk for the Congress. The second concern is the working style of Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli. He is a towering personality, a hard-working leader, and with his strong command over his party organisation, he can swiftly implement any proposal. The Congress ministers who also have to listen to the concerns of the party’s top leaders may struggle to strike a balance. In Oli’s Cabinet, ministers are likely to get less freedom within their ministries. A rift is thus likely because of Prime Minister Oli’s working style.Why didn’t the Congress then send influential leaders to the Cabinet to check the prime minister?The leaders might not have been so interested in joining this government. They might have sensed intervention from the prime minister’s office and thought they might not be able to perform as per their expectation under Oli’s leadership. See, chiefs of the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre work in a dictatorial way. Once they are elected at the party convention for four years, they behave like dictators. They take decisions on their own without any consultations. People in Nepal often lobby for a directly-elected prime minister or President. I wonder what these leaders would do if they were directly elected as executive head. So, the problem is in the working style and attitude of our leaders, not in the constitution or the electoral system.Shekhar Koirala and Gagan Thapa had first pitched for joining hands with the UML to end ‘unnecessary bargaining’ of fringe parties. Suddenly, Deuba struck the deal with Oli. And, now Koirala and Thapa seem sceptical about the deal.The proposal of Koirala and Thapa was for Congress leading the government and the UML supporting it. In fact, Oli was ready to accept Congress leadership. He requested the Congress leaders to take the lead. Surprisingly, the negotiating team led by our party president reached an opposite deal. They offered government leadership to Oli.Then, could it be that, as some claim, Deuba and his wife Arzu were desperate to unseat Dahal fearing they could be dragged into corruption scams?I don’t know much about that scenario. But what I knew is that Oli was willing to join a Congress-led government.Why would Deuba, who is a very clever leader in making such give-and-take deals, have given up a chance to be prime minister right away?It’s true that all three party chiefs—Deuba, Oli and Dahal—are very clever in making deals in their own favour based on their numerical strength. A leader beats the other two on one occasion and on another, another of them comes out on top. It’s like a see-saw. This time Oli won the game.Congress General Secretaries Gagan Thapa and Bishwa Prakash Sharma have expressed suspicion over the implementation of the deal. Many say they did so as Deuba didn’t involve them in negotiations on power-sharing. Is it true?The party’s central work execution committee endorsed the deal signed by the two leaders. The leaders who participate in such meetings should speak up then and there if there is anything objectionable, instead of making such statements in public. Why didn’t they oppose it at the meeting? I don’t see any point in expressing doubt over the deal in public while endorsing the same in party committees.The two general secretaries also expressed doubt over Oli handing over government leadership to Deuba as per the agreement. Why this mistrust?The experience of the past two or three decades makes politicians suspicious of each other. Nepali politicians have hardly ever handed over government leadership easily. After four or five months of collaboration, some issues emerge and a rift is created. So, history makes us doubt that this coalition will last for three and half years. In the meantime, the party establishments have sidelined other factions when it comes to picking ministers, both at federal and provincial levels. When the government fails to perform as per expectation, party cadres of the ruling parties start criticising the government. Is it possible to amend the constitution as the two parties have announced?We can’t backtrack on the inclusive system. We must abide by the policy of inclusion in state agencies. The leaders who spoiled this system are saying that the proportional representation (PR) system is not working. But there is room to make our three-tier federal system more cost-effective. People get irritated when they see a large number of representatives benefitting from state coffers. We can bring down the number of local units from 753 to around 400. However, there should be sufficient wards as those units are directly involved in service delivery while the Palikas are more engaged in development activities. The number of ward members can also be decreased. In provinces, we don’t need PR seats as those elected from the provincial constituencies automatically represent the local communities. Likewise, the provincial cabinets can be downsized. Thus we can downsize the number of people who benefit from state coffers. This is vital to make the federal system sustainable. Similarly, we can rightsize the number of PR seats by adopting a rotational constituency for women, dalits and other marginalised communities. Only the candidates from underrepresented sections will compete in those constituencies. This will help elect competent people even from within the targeted communities. This is how we can address some concerns without compromising the inclusive system envisioned in the constitution.Why has the Congress picked gangsters and tainted individuals as ministers in provinces?The selection of such controversial individuals as ministers and policy makers will damage the party’s image. People are going to raise this issue seriously. In fact the pace of criminalisation and commercialisation of Nepali politics is faster than the political reform being undertaken to clean up politics.It seems intellectual leaders are being sidelined while gangsters are being promoted. Why is it happening?Because people from intellectual or political backgrounds voice critical views and leaders don’t like it. They speak what their conscience says is right. For instance, leaders like Mahesh Acharya and Minendra Rijal aren’t given any role in the party. It is a common problem in all the major political forces in Nepal.Is the space for leaders with intellectual backgrounds and having critical views being squeezed?The Congress used to be a very liberal organisation. But it has also become illiberal and leaders have become increasingly intolerant. All leaders—whether the seniors or young ones—are becoming less tolerant even of constructive criticism. Party leaders haven’t spoken against the selection of gangsters as ministers. Even the office bearers who are in decision making bodies and can change the decisions are silent now. This is dangerous. This is an example of how critical voices are sidelined.Haven’t the two young general secretaries been able to raise hope in the Congress?They are working like central committee members. General secretaries should be able to intervene while making crucial policy decisions. They can stop the party committees from making wrong decisions. But they are risk-averse. They are not taking the risk to fight the powerful party establishment.Historically, in all parties there is a trend of its anti-establishment faction bargaining for 40-45 percent seats in the party or government. If they don’t get an acceptable power sharing deal, they don’t cooperate with the party leadership. Is it a healthy democratic practice?Intra-party competition compels the leaders to do this. The ruthless establishment always sidelines party members and leaders if they aren’t loyal. So, the leadership of the anti-establishment has to protect such cadres because the rival factor too needs a strong support base of cadres to compete against the powerful establishment. Party establishments are strong due to centralised resources and other factors, so you need an equally strong force to compete against them. \nScores of people have been killed in landslides, floods and other monsoon-induced disasters within a month of the monsoon entering Nepal in the second week of June. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asks Jagadishwor Karmacharya, director general of the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology, what the department is doing to save people from disasters and whether our system is ready to cope with the challenges posed by climate change.Where is Nepal in terms of technology and expertise when it comes to forecasting the ever-changing weather patterns?If we compare to our situation a decade ago, we have made significant progress in setting up meteorological stations, collecting real-time data and increasing the frequency of weather predictions. We get rainfall data from around 350 stations, while we receive information about temperature and other related parameters from around 150 stations. We have an additional 175 centres to collect information about water levels. Our servers get real-time data every 10 minutes from all these stations. Besides that, we also have manual data collection centres. Thus, we have around 800 data collection centres in total. But we haven’t been able to set up enough stations in the Himalayan range due to difficult topography, low presence of government agencies and other factors. Also, we release radiosonde balloons to collect data on temperature, humidity and wind speed from the upper levels of the atmosphere. Overall, we have made huge strides in using technologies in the past decade, but it is still insufficient to cater to people’s expectations. They want specific weather information about their present location or destination. The expectation is valid. But our complex and diverse topography and meteorological phenomenon—ranging from the Tarai belt to the Himalayan range—makes accurate forecasts challenging. Kaski’s Lumle sees maximum rainfall in the country, and around 40 km north of it, the Jomsom area sees negligible rain. So great variability within a short distance adds to the challenge of forecasting.Do we have sufficient stations to cater to that variability?We need more stations because the higher you go, the more variabilities you find. In the plains, the weather pattern is more homogenous, while it is highly heterogeneous in the hills. In Tarai, even a station in around 100-150 kilometres may work because there is less variability of temperature as well as rainfall. But we need more stations in the hills where rain patterns drastically change.Are our methods and technologies being updated over time?Until around a decade ago, the forecasters used to predict based on their experience and the data received every three hours from the synoptic weather stations of Nepal and other neighbouring countries. At the time, we used to predict weather only for a day. Now, we synthesise the data collected from our systems and those from the modelling centres from India, China and other countries. Now, we can forecast for three days.Our capacity has significantly increased mainly in observing real time happenings. As I said, we take updates from hundreds of stations every 10 minutes. We also take satellite pictures from 16 channels of Japan’s Himawari Satellite, which has stationed its receiver in Nepal as well, also every 10 minutes. Until over a decade ago, we used to receive satellite pictures just once or twice a day. Even those pictures weren’t as good as those we get these days. We used to update surface-related data in three hours and upper air data in 12 hours. Based on that, we made a weather forecast for the next 12 hours. In comparison, we now have a large number of hydrological and meteorological real-time observation stations, the updates from Himawari and other satellites every 10 minutes and we have three radars to gather information. With the help of these technologies, now we can get immediate real-time updates. It helps us analyse the data of past hours and predict possible scenarios of the next six to 12 hours. We inform people accordingly. But we have to work more on the technology to make longer forecasts. Despite these progresses, we are still 15-20 years back in comparison to the technologies used by developed countries. We are behind in research. We need more expertise and an upgrade of our technology. Nepal doesn’t have its own satellite. Is this problematic?On the weather observation part, our work has not been hampered because we get data from the satellites of India, China and Japan. On the communication part, we are getting support from telecom companies—NTC and NCell—to transfer data. It covers most parts of the country. Absence of a satellite of our own is less of a concern compared to our other needs.Climate change has brought about massive changes in weather patterns. Do we have sufficient expertise to cope with this?The organisational structure and positions in our department haven’t changed much in over three decades. Demand for our work has drastically increased in the past two decades but we haven’t been able to cater to the demand. We need engineers capable of working with the latest technologies but we don’t have positions for such professionals in our current structure. We have procured some technologies and got some from our donors. But we don’t even have experts to use that as well.As you said, the department has made progress in the past decade but in this period climate change has progressed even faster. How do we keep up with this change?We face new challenges almost every year. In the past couple of years, mountain districts such as Manang and Mustang have not only witnessed rainfalls but also heavy downpours that even swept away bridges and other structures. Last year, over 30 hydropower projects were badly damaged by floods in eastern Nepal. The floods that wreaked havoc in Melamchi in 2021 were unprecedented. These incidents are evidence that climate change has already started to show unusual patterns and cause damages in this Himalayan range. We will face extreme weather patterns like long droughts and heavy rainfalls.The Dodhara weather station of Kanchanpur recorded 624mm of rainfall in 24 hours earlier this month. This is a new record. Before that, 540mm was the highest rainfall recorded, around two decades ago. Upward shifting of snowline in the mountains and formation of glacial lakes are other indications of the impacts of climate change. Don’t you think it’s already late to restructure government agencies, review policies and even redesign our systems?That is necessary. Devastation in Melamchi is one example that suggests the same. While developing such projects, we have to seriously consider possible impacts of climate change. Even if they analyse the possible scenario, they refer to the data of the past few decades. But things are changing so fast, decisions based on old data might not be useful. So, it is becoming more challenging to make projections. Design guidelines definitely need to be updated. Our division lacks policies, let alone updated ones. Though we are issuing red alerts and carrying out other tasks on scientific grounds, we don’t have a legal basis even to do these things.A large number of people in Nepal die in floods and landslides every year. Can we tweak our forecast system to save more lives?We have succeeded in reducing the deaths by floods in comparison to the loss we used to incur until 8-10 years ago. Earlier, we didn’t have flood alert service. It has been around a decade since we started the dedicated flood service. These days, we send mass SMS to the people of areas where floods may cause damage and for that we collaborate with telecoms—NTC and Ncell. We also work with district authorities and I/NGOs mainly in flood-prone districts to run campaigns and conduct drills. This has been quite effective. We are also taking similar initiatives in collaboration with telecom companies and other agencies to inform people on 13 various hydro-meteorological hazards such as, rains, lightning, winds.Working on floods is comparatively easier as it has certain catchment areas and we can focus on specific areas. So our efforts yield results. But in other incidents we can’t focus on certain areas. In floods, we inform the people hours before the flood so that they can shift to safe places. In the past, the death toll from floods used to be the highest. Now there are more deaths from landslides and lightning. We need to work more to give accurate information on lightning as well. Landslides vulnerability has increased due to extreme weather patterns, the impact of 2015 earthquake and rampant road construction.Why don’t people in Nepal follow and rely on weather forecasts? Is it due to negligence or lack of reliability of the prediction?It might be both. If the forecast doesn’t match reality, they may not follow or rely on us. So we need to improve our accuracy. Secondly, we need to increase awareness. Moreover, the weather isn’t as predictable as it used to be. So, we should keep on working, improving accuracy and making people aware. Many rely on international forecasts but not our own. Is our system less efficient?There are two aspects. One is getting accurate information and the second is user-friendly and attractive visual presentation of data, such as in mobile apps. We lag in the second part. Also, people want specific information about their locality and their intended destination. In the past, we used to give information by dividing the country in major regions such as eastern, central, western parts, tarai and hills. Now we have narrowed it down to each district. We need to work more on research.Have we succeeded in connecting weather forecasts to people’s livelihoods?The United Nations has launched the ‘Early Warning For All’ initiative to ensure that everyone on Earth is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events through life-saving early warning systems by the end of 2027. Various stakeholders need to join hands to implement it effectively as it has various components. Our expertise is to give as accurate information as we can. We give inputs but there are other agencies that go to the community level and work with the people.What are the things that need to be done in the changed context?We shouldn’t limit our work to simple forecasting but move to impact-based forecasts. For instance, we issue a seven-day Agromet Advisory Bulletin in collaboration with Nepal Agricultural Research Council which includes a summary on weather, crops, livestock, tables on weather and agrometeorological parameters, current weather information along with weather forecast (outlook). In a similar way, we can work with stakeholders on road transport as well. Then, we can make our forecast impactful, connect the general people and win their trust. But that requires proper policies and laws, updating this department’s organisational structure and enhancing the capacity of our human resource. \nThe July 1 midnight deal between the Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML, the first and the second largest parties in the federal lower house respectively, turned national politics on its head. Pushpa Kamal Dahal was thrown out as prime minister and KP Oli assumed the country’s leadership. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Maoist Centre leader Ram Karki, who has cultivated an image of a rebel within the party, on his reading of the event. How do you see the CPN-UML’s rebuffing of the CPN (Maoist Centre) and formation of a new government with the Nepali Congress?If you see it from the perspective of those who believe in parliamentary democracy, this is wrong. In the system, the largest party is believed to have the public mandate to run the government and the second-biggest to be the main opposition. A weak opposition makes for a weak parliamentary system. The system isn’t an ideal one for us [communists]. The two parties have made a mockery of the system they advocate for. Why didn’t the Maoist party that championed progressive agendas implement them when in government?We should admit that we lost the moral authority to implement and execute those agendas. We could have implemented those ideals by mobilising peasants, working-class groups, and people from oppressed communities, but our grip and connection with them have loosened.Why did the party and the leadership distance itself from the working class?The state has two arms—coercive and persuasive. The Maoists succeeded in using coercive force. But you can’t use this all the time. One has to use persuasive force most of the time. When we joined mainstream politics, we were the leading political force. We were in power. At the time we should have changed our education sector. For that, we should have worked on our curriculum and trained teachers. Our educational system is guided by patriarchal and feudal values. We need to orient people to questioning and following science. The party couldn’t do so. Had we done so, we would now have a critical mass with us. The Maoist leaders lost the moral ground. When you preach lofty ideas, the public won’t listen to you. They instead watch your lifestyle. Earlier, the Congress and the UML leaders, who were outsiders in Kathmandu, got ‘polluted’ when they worked in collusion with the capital’s elites. We, too, got ‘polluted’ by hobnobbing with the two parties. The working class and oppressed communities that had helped the Maoist party fight the state felt betrayed. The leaders and the masses are separated now. The Maoist party was the true leader of the progressive agenda such as inclusion, federalism, secularism and republicanism. These ideas are still valid, but the party failed to honour them. It failed because it lost its strength and disconnected itself from the class it fought for. It tried to become the leader of all people. The oppressed communities felt betrayal, while the other classes didn’t accept the party because of our past. Do you think the Congress and the UML will try to undermine progressive agendas enshrined in the new constitution?They have also sold lofty ideas to the people in the past. A counter-revolution under the two parties’ leadership is not easy. Their rank and file won’t accept it. The Congress, in fact, is not only a political party but a collective where you find radical Hindus as well as hardcore secularists. It stays strong as long as it works as a unified force of various groups. But when it imitates communists and tries to be a rigid cadre-based party, it loses its space and strength. So the Congress can’t lead a counter-revolution against progressive ideas. Counter-revolution is not easy, but the reactionary forces have certainly succeeded in regaining their space.Observers and politicians from rival parties claim that the Maoist Centre is now in an existential crisis. Do you think it can make a comeback?More importantly, the space that used to be occupied by the Maoist party is now left unoccupied.Can’t the UML or other forces make inroads into that space?The UML is a tried and tested force. Even the Maoist Centre is now described as a tested force. How can older forces enter that space? A force mightier than the Maoists can emerge. As a Maoist party member, I still vow to rejuvenate and revive the Maoist Centre. I am trying to convince my fellow comrades to do that. But my voice hasn’t prevailed. I have been presenting my papers in the party’s general conventions. We still have a strong belief that sooner or later, we will prevail because we are raising valid issues.Various leftist groups have at various times tried to create a strong, united left political force in Nepal. Do you think ideas like socialism and communism still attract the youth?Some rebel voices within our parties take some initiatives to raise our collective voice to build pressure on party establishments. But this has been limited to theoretical debates and failed to translate into politics. A theory or philosophy is like an iron plate, while crafting a tool from that iron is politics. We haven’t been able to transform our ideas into political action. If a leader floats a political agenda, the people first study the leader’s integrity. If a leader with a strong moral authority proposes an idea, people trust and follow it. If Gandhi was wearing a suit and telling people to wear handwoven khadi, Indian people wouldn’t have followed him. Similarly, if Mao was using clothes, watches and vehicles from developed countries while preaching for simplicity, Chinese people wouldn’t have followed him.Our people don’t listen to our leaders because they don’t see the leaders walk the talk. Youths are always attracted by adventurism; they are receptive and sensitive to certain incidents. Now, they aren’t following us because they don’t find any adventure and newness in our ideas. If we do some soul searching and correct ourselves, the Maoist Centre still can lead the process to complete the unfinished progressive agendas. Is that possible under the current Maoist leadership that has lost its credibility while staying in power for long? Will the people trust them?People will judge them based on their actions. If the Maoist leaders were more credible, there would be no space for the Congress and UML to come together. Either one or the other force would seek the Maoist party’s support. They wouldn’t have dared to ignore the Maoist party that led progressive issues in the recent past. They were emboldened because of the Maoists’ diminishing influence. Therefore, we have to correct ourselves in practice.You said that the classes and communities the Maoist party used to lead now have no leader. Can new outfits occupy that space?The traditional parties—the Congress, the UML and the Maoist Centre–don’t have any strategic vision on where they want to see the country in 20 years. The new forces are worse. They hit a ball and wherever it reaches, shift the goalpost there. They carry the goalpost with them. New forces with such visions can’t replace old parties. History shows that Nepal has witnessed political upheavals in a gap of 10-15 years. In the past such tsunamis have changed the political systems. Now we have seen sparks of movements but they are scattered. New forces need an ideological weapon. The Maoists forgot to sharpen their ideological weapon over time by holding ideological debates and upgrading themselves. Another is intra-party democracy. A political party that doesn’t practise intra-party democracy can’t enforce democracy in society.From the perspectives of intra-party democracy, the Maoist Centre is probably the most undemocratic of major political forces. Why?In the Congress, you are free to speak, but you don’t have a say in execution. Communist parties are too centralised. The structure conceptualised around a century ago in the context of wars and other contexts hasn’t been updated. Even new parties are run by the party chiefs imitating the anomalies of traditional forces. A leader is praised if s/he takes immediate decisions, gets them endorsed from the party committees and implements them swiftly. Those who say they have to first discuss the issue in party committees are described as weak. Such a trend is killing intra-party democracy.Do you think the Congress-UML coalition will succeed?A coalition between the parties that don’t even have a common minimum programme is a coalition of opportunists. They don’t have a moral ground either. On ideological grounds, the Congress still cites the late BP Koirala because no other leader of the party has worked on the theoretical front for decades. Such is also the situation with communists. They still cite the theoretical works of the late Pushpa Lal Shrestha. The current alliance is not a principled one, it’s a collaboration between opportunists. So, don’t expect anything better.How do you evaluate the outgoing government?It did nothing for the class it represents. The prime minister’s secretariat might have prepared a list of ‘100 important achievements of the government’. But what is the government’s priority? It failed to even give skills to those going abroad in search of work. They would have found better work had we given them valuable skills. Not only the outgoing one but all the previous governments have failed. The Congress-UML alliance has said it wants to review the constitution and amend the charter when necessary. How do you see this idea?This will be backtracking from the present constitutional roadmap. It is dishonest to create hindrance in implementing the federal system and then suggest the system is a burden. Such moves would give space to those who want to raise questions on republic and secular systems. There is a strong faction that lobbies for Hindutwa in the Nepali Congress. It is no secret that the Congress and the UML were not in favour of republic, secular and federal systems. But later, they rode the popular wave. But they have still not internalised it, and there are some regressive elements in both the parties but the people, who have come too far, won’t backtrack.Don’t you think the coming together of Congress and UML may ensure political stability?Instability is okay for me because stability may not necessarily be good for a country like ours. See, a single leader has been ruling a party continuously for over 30 years. What if they rule the country in a similar way? Look at some countries where a single leader has ruled for decades. The current arrangement is better than such stability.Will the Maoist party chairman and prime minister, who didn’t even appoint a minister from a Dalit community, have the moral authority to again champion the agenda of the oppressed?Appointing a minister is again an ornamental approach to appease certain communities. What we should do is ensure the participation of oppressed communities in policymaking.But party chair Dahal may again seek ways to get back to power. Will he pay attention to these issues?We should stop this chase for power at all cost. We will say this in our party meetings. We should accept the reality that we have just 32 seats and so we won’t get sufficient space to implement any important programmes even if we join the government.The way your party chief remained in power for over 18 months using various tactics, was it right?If you see it through a parliamentarian’s lens, it looks quite smart. If you see it through a Marxist perspective, just becoming a prime minister is futile if you can’t implement your policies and strengthen republicanism and participatory democracy. \nThe Nepali Congress and the CPN-UML last week reached an agreement to form a coalition government under the leadership of UML chair KP Sharma Oli. As a part of the package, they also aim to make certain changes to the constitution. The Post’s Thira Lal Bhusal asked Pradeep Gyawali, deputy general secretary of UML, the reasons behind the coming together of the two largest parties, how they plan to run the government and to review and amend the constitution.Many are seeing the Congress-UML alliance as something unusual. What factors brought the two largest parties together even as there is no crisis-like situation or a special task such as constitution writing?Definitely, in normal parliamentary practice, the two largest parties don’t forge an alliance to run a government. The party that gets the biggest mandate leads the government, and the other big party remains in the opposition to make the ruling force accountable. In Nepal, the country’s two major forces, the Congress and the UML, have also joined hands in certain junctures for certain purposes. They worked together to make the constitution in 1990, to conduct general elections in 1999, to complete transition after the 2006 people’s movement and to bring out the constitution in 2015. We felt a need for a similar collaboration this time around. After the November 2022 elections, we saw three alliances in our parliament. At first, Maoist Centre chair Pushpa Kamal Dahal became prime minister with our support, but he failed to abide by the agreement sincerely. He changed the coalition within a month. The subsequent alliance between the Congress and the Maoist Centre lasted for a year. He again sought the UML’s support. Within four months of the March 4 deal with the UML, he started yet another gameplan to join hands with the Congress under the pretext of forming a national consensus government. It was quite unusual for the prime minister himself to instigate instability in the government. He publicly boasted that he had a ‘magical number’ [32 seats in the House of Representatives]. He thought that he could employ the tactic of ‘use and throw’ with the two largest parties and rule the country for the full term. He was completely indifferent to people’s plight, the country’s pressing issues and service delivery. This was the height of irresponsibility. So, the UML and Congress leaders concluded that the time had come to intervene to ensure political stability and service delivery and make sure public frustration doesn’t get out of hand. Did external factors play a role? Recent statements by UML leaders suggest that the party has taken it seriously. When national forces are weak, the neighbouring countries and international forces become more cautious, even more so given Nepal’s geo-political situation. Some of their concerns are valid. They fear political instability in Nepal may have an adverse impact on their genuine issues. We have to take this naturally. Second, it is no secret that we have a long legacy of facing external interference. Sometimes such interventions are carried out covertly and sometimes overtly. Therefore, national forces should be strong. Some political parties and leaders have a tendency of seeking external forces’ support to fulfil their vested interests. In return, they serve the external forces’ undue interests. Formation of a government is a purely domestic affair, but in our case sometimes it also becomes an issue of geopolitical interest. It is said that the UML was spooked when it learned that Prime Minister Dahal had reportedly approached the Congress for a new alliance. This reportedly happened after Dahal returned from New Delhi following Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s swearing-in.We were taken by surprise when the Congress leaders told us that the prime minister had reached out to them with a proposal to form a national consensus government. We were informed about the development from the leaders of the main opposition party. When we reached the March 4 deal with the prime minister, we thought he came to us with a commitment to course correction. Based on that, we supported him almost unconditionally. We didn’t bargain while sharing ministerial portfolios and didn’t talk about the prime minister’s term. We had even thought of allowing Dahal to run the government for the full term if the government functioned well and people were satisfied. We hadn’t even imagined that we would have to think about changing the coalition within four months.We definitely had certain grievances such as a lack of consultation with our party and our lawmakers while preparing the government’s policies and programmes and while allocating budget. Our party chair brought up this issue with the prime minister. But our concerns weren’t addressed. They had already started to ignore us. There were several issues with the prime minister, but we were committed to the partnership. But they had already gone too far. Fortunately, the Congress leaders didn’t accept the offer and instead raised critical questions about the rationale behind the proposal. Basically, the Congress didn’t trust Prachanda ji [Dahal] and came to us. It concluded that Dahal didn’t come with the intent of solving the country’s problems but to manoeuvre between the Congress and the UML.Besides jointly running the government, constitution amendment is another major aspect of the latest Congress-UML deal. What are the provisions the parties want to change?There are four major objectives of this agreement. Safeguarding national interest; strengthening economy; improving governance and service delivery; and ensuring political stability. A debate has started that some constitutional provisions are not helping maintain political stability. What we have said is that it’s been almost a decade since the promulgation of this constitution. Some of its provisions are yet to be implemented. On the other hand, provincial governments complain that they have not been able to work in a full-fledged way because the federal government has still not made some laws they need. So, first, we will undertake a comprehensive review on the progress in the course of implementing the constitution and the challenges we faced in the past decade, among other things. While doing so, we will find out if there are provisions that have posed challenges in maintaining political stability and running a stable government and suggest amendments accordingly.So, it’s not only about the amendment but also about review, assessment and recommendation for amendment, if there is a need. Even if the amendment process begins, it will be limited to ensuring political stability and won’t touch other aspects of the statute. There is no need to over-react. For instance, some Maoist leaders are trying to make it a political issue by describing it as a regressive move. That is wrong.So as per the two-party deal, the statute will be reviewed but not necessarily amended?Yes, whether to go for amendments will depend on the findings of the review. No constitution in the world is perfect. Its success largely depends on the practitioners. So, first we have to differentiate between the role of the constitution and the practitioners. It is true that our society is divided over certain provisions of our constitution. All these issues will be considered, but the fundamental features of the constitution such as democracy, inclusion and federalism won’t be altered. Our priority would be to only remove hindrances in making the system more functional, people-oriented and productive.Of late, people are debating the electoral system, provincial structure and secularism. Will these issues also be dealt with?Federalism is a new system for us. In fact, it is still an in-the-making process in Nepal. We have to note some timelines while analysing the performance of provinces. After the provincial and federal elections in 2017, the first provincial governments were formed in 2018, and they worked for around three years in a stable way. With small cabinets, they worked genuinely to strengthen the provincial system. At the time, most provincial cabinets had around six to seven ministers. They weren’t severely criticised at the time. The wrong trends in the provinces started with the division of the then Nepal Communist Party and the fall of the NCP-led governments at the centre as well as provinces. We saw the trend of horse-trading in provinces. Small parties made unjustified bargaining for ministerial portfolios, chief ministers started splitting ministries and increasing the number of ministers in their cabinets. Also, the November 2022 polls again gave a fragmented verdict, further augmenting the instability and anomalies at the provincial level. So, the problem is the way we are handling things more than the provincial structures. The time isn’t ripe to seek an alternative to the provinces. As far as the electoral model is concerned, we included proportional electoral (PR) system after long debates and discussions. Based on three general elections held after 1990, a conclusion was drawn that the first-past-the-post (FPTP) model couldn’t properly represent the historically under-represented sections. The premise is still valid. Based on the achievements, we may exclude certain communities from the list. But that time hasn’t come. Two questions raised over the use of PR are valid. Is the system really doing justice to the strata and class of the society for which it was introduced? This is the question not about the PR system but the leaders who use it. Similarly, some questions: Is proportional representation required in executive as well because representation is basically vital for policy making? The forms and modalities of the PR system might be discussed, but no one has even thought of removing the inclusive system.Similar is the case with secularism. The spirit is to make the state patron of all religions in the country. However, some sections of society have often tried to misuse and misinterpret the new constitutional provision. They try to interpret secularism as openly allowing rampant religious conversion, and some have made it an excuse to attack the age-old Sanatan faith. For instance, if the President or prime minister visits Lumbini, gurudwara or a shrine of any other faith on certain occasions, that is taken positively, but when they visit Pashupatinath Temple, a section of people raise questions. These activities have made some people think that these attacks on our Sanatan faith are taking place because of the secular system. There is no problem in the constitutional provision because the statute added an explanatory note that states, “‘secular’ means religious, cultural freedoms, including protection of religion and culture handed down from time immemorial.” But some extremist activities have given wrong impressions.Some experts believe the problem of fragmented mandate can be addressed by increasing the threshold required for a political party to be eligible to get PR seats, which can be done by amending laws. Will the Congress-UML alliance opt for this?Yes, this is one feasible option. I am in favour of this. As per the existing provision, a political party can secure seats under the PR category by securing 3 percent votes in the federal parliament and 1.5 percent votes in provincial assemblies. If a political organisation doesn’t even represent 5 or 7 or 10 percent of the population, what can they contribute to the country? You do politics to represent a sizable population and get a public mandate. Otherwise, the presence of such groups would only promote unreasonable bargaining and instigate instability in governments. This can be one of the agenda of the discussion between the two parties.This time, leaders have made it transparent that chiefs of the two parties will lead the government on a rotational basis. But why have other details of the agreement not been made public?There hasn’t been topic-wise discussions on specific provisions. The broader understanding is to review and assess the implementation aspect of the constitution and move ahead based on the findings of the assessment. We have also made it clear that such an act will be guided only by the objective of ensuring political stability and we will not go beyond that. Who will undertake this type of constitution review?We haven’t worked on it in detail. We haven’t reached any understanding. Naturally, inputs will be taken from the constitution makers, experts on constitutional law and politicians involved in this field. But no decision has been made on its nitty-gritty.The Rastriya Prajatantra Party that wants to revive the Hindu kingdom was the first party to welcome the Congress-UML deal while the Maoist Centre has accused Congress and UML of making a regressive move. So don’t you think this affair is tricky?I don’t think the political parties will touch the issues that the RPP talks about, such as reinstatement of Hindu kingdom and dissolution of federalism. No one is thinking about that. Also, the questions raised by the Maoist leaders have no meaning. They are only trying to make a political agenda.It also seems that the Congress and the UML floated this idea of reviewing the constitution to make a case for the two largest parties to form the government.That’s not true. This question undermines the spirit of this agreement. If this system fails, people will raise questions mainly to the leaders of the Congress and the UML, not Prachanda. It’s not only about running the government. We were already in the government and it isn’t a big deal for the Congress to return to power. If democracy fails, the democratic forces will lose the most. So we are genuinely working on this. The Congress and the UML are historical rival forces in Nepali politics. How can the two work together in government?It is true that the Congress and the UML are the two major competitors of this country. But we have some converging factors. First, we both believe in a broader democratic framework. Sometimes, the Congress may give more emphasis on liberal values while we may push for more socialism-oriented programmes. But the common ground is democratic values. We also have the experience of successfully carrying out certain tasks jointly. We may have some friction but we also have experience of managing bitter intra-party fighting as well as inter-party rivalry.How will the ministerial portfolios be shared in the new coalition?We haven’t reached any agreement in detail. As we aim to make this a ‘national consensus government’ we are in favour of accommodating other parties. So it will depend on the number of parties that join the Cabinet. Our only concern is that ministerial allocations should be done in a way that doesn’t weaken the prime minister in order to ensure that the head of the government can deliver.How can a government without the Maoist Centre and some other parties be called a consensus government?We have to wait for that. Leaders of political parties that fiercely criticise the government also join the Cabinet under one or other pretext. Some political parties seemingly cannot exist without being in the government.  \nNepal is experiencing monsoon weather with partly cloudy conditions, light to moderate rainfall, and possible heavy rainfall in Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, Karnali, Sudurpaschim, Koshi provinces; temperatures ranged from 14.5°C to 35.7°C.\nLight to heavy rainfall with thunder and lightning is expected throughout Nepal today and tonight, with the highest recorded temperature being 35.5 degrees Celsius in Bhairahawa and the lowest recorded temperature being 15 degrees Celsius in Jomsom.\nFriday's weather forecast predicts scattered light to moderate rain, heavy rainfall in some areas, and wind gusts in certain regions, with temperatures ranging from 13.5°C to 36.4°C.\nPartly or generally cloudy weather with rain predicted across most provinces, with heavy rainfall possible in specific areas, while Simara and Jomsom experience temperature extremes.\n\nBe elaborative as possible.
